la34bh,stocks,"It's fucking awful seeing the ""Silver"" misinformation campaign everywhere I look","⚠️⚠️⚠️ ***DON'T BUY SILVER, IT'S A TRAP***⚠️⚠️⚠️

They're talking on CNBC as if people on Reddit are actually squeezing silver. It's fucking absurd, they're practically encouraging it. 

They're like, ""Wow, these redditors are squeezing silver, how cool"" actually fucking encouraging it. 

Literally scum

Edit: Should have mentioned, it's literally fucking impossible to squeeze silver. It's not shorted at all. Hedge funds and Citadel hold lots of Long positions in it, not shorts. Buying it would be playing right into their hands.

Buying silver will make you likely lose money and absolutely give it to the hedge funds and Citadel.

By Silver, I mean $SLV, *I know nothing about phisical silver*. For anybody confused

Edit 2: If you bought $SLV months or years ago and made a profit, that's fantastic. This post is just saying that you should not buy silver right now.

Not sure if they are really concerned about their customers, or they've been lobbied by hedge funds to prevent ordinary people from destroying them. I don't care about GME and AMC, I have no position, but now I am angry for this decision. They always go against the poor individuals and let the billionaires save their asses.

l7awnp,stocks,Today is a dark day for traders,"It does not matter if you invested in GME, made money on NOK, or you are just interested in the stock market.

Today different brokers took down from MILLIONS of retail traders the opportunity to partecipate actively in the stock market to save some billionaires hedge funds.

In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

For few years in wich the possibility to partecipate was estended to a lot of retail users, and guess what happened? Most retail users (up to 80%) lost money having no idea what they were doing.

In the last few weeks GME has been the opportunity for normal people to take something back from the people controlling the market, and when they were finally succeeding, guess what?

They cut us out.

l8rhr3,stocks,Weekend GME Thread + Homework for all: Let's stop using brokerages that halted trading,"Hello all,

Let's use this thread to discuss the GameStop situation this weekend, please don't open new threads about it unless it is a unique perspective or brings very valuable information.

Do note, posts and comments are still restricted to users with a higher Karma and account age.

##Important information

First, let's get some things out of the way:

* The short squeeze has not squoze yet, short interest estimates are still extremely high, I won't post the sources and encourage you to search for it yourself.
* The gamma squeeze has not happened, it may happen Monday, it may happen gradually, it may not happen (if their positions have already been covered), it isn't necessary for anything to happen, however.
* The establishment is still lying about many things for the purpose of market manipulation (Jim Cramer, CNBC, etc.). These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! 
* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.

##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

The worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.

Now, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.

**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**

Here is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:

### Horrible Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets and lied/gloated about it

### Note regarding the clearing houses

The first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading. The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:

* Apex Clearing
* Barclays
* IKBR

We don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.

Additionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.

Note: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.

We might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.

n2ihgo,stocks,Why hasn't Robinhood still not received any form of punishment/fine when they restricted the buying on 50 different stocks back in January?,"This article contains the list: https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html

I know other brokerages restricted GME/AMC. But Robinhood's restricted list was way bigger and included stocks such as AMD, AAL, BYND, GM, IPOE, MRNA, and SBUX. I had got into stocks in January 2021 as a new years resolution. Which was a couple weeks before the GME stuff and reddit trading was even all over the news. At the time I honestly thought the buying restriction was something a part of the stock market. As a few stocks had been getting suspended in trading in both buying/selling quite frequently prior to RH restrictions. 

Now that a couple months have passed looking back. Im honestly shocked RH didn't receive any type of fine/punishment for that. They limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside.

l8b4pp,stocks,Is anyone else feeling really depressed from the turn of events recently?,"I used to be a proud trader and investor, determined to break through the shackles of society to reach financial freedom. I started out with almost zero, and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year, I was able to completely change my life around. I used to think that if I worked hard, did my due diligence, traded smartly, I could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams. Something has shifted now. I no longer feel the same way, and I'm not sure if I ever will again.

I wonder if it's naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair. I'm not American so I wasn't aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008, but it seems that many people are equating what's happening now to back then, calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor.

They can crash multiple brokerages at the same time, disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously, manipulate price action in real-time by changing the supply/demand, unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted. We've always understood that the media was manipulated, but it was up to us if we wanted to listen. But our direct purchase of stocks, and outright price action manipulation, suddenly it feels very personal.

It just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that I've enjoyed and come to love so much, is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want, at any time they want in favor of their own interests. I came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement, and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities. I'm sad to think that I may never have this outlook again, in light of everything that's been coming out.  Just looking for words of encouragement right now. I love investing and I don't want that joy to be taken from me

lazcak,stocks,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.

The principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.

First red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming ""if he's still in, I'm still in!"" and ""look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold"" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \*unrealized gains\*, there is a \*huge\* difference.

Second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.

But even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go ""to the moon,"" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.

**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.

Want to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.

**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.

**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.

**Edit2:**

wow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:

* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.
* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.
* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!

**Edit3 2/3/21:**

Full disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \~$900 realized loss.

My gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.

**Edit4 2/25/21:**

**I stand by my decisions, both to buy and to sell. I don't speculate on bubbles. Period. But you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and you'll never find me shaming you about it.**",2021-02-02 16:14:50,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640076,1121 days 05:55:33.640076,5555,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lazcak/what_gme_has_taught_me_in_36_hours_of_day_trading/

rh65q3,stocks,Pelosi rejects stock-trading ban for members of Congress: 'We are free market economy. They should be able to participate in that',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected the idea of banning members of Congress and their spouses from holding and trading individual stocks while in office.

""This is a free market, and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that,"" Pelosi said when asked by Insider at her weekly press conference.

Insider also asked Pelosi about ""Conflicted Congress,"" a 5-month-long investigation by Insider that found 49 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the STOCK Act, a law to prevent Insider trading.

The Speaker said she had not yet seen the project, but said that it's important that members are complying with the law.

""If people aren't reporting, they should be,"" she said.

Pelosi's position puts her at odds with the likes of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom have called for banning members of congress from trading stocks while in office.

""It is absolutely ludicrous that members of Congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office,"" Ocasio-Cortez recently wrote on Twitter. ""The access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest, not our profit. It shouldn't be legal for us to trade individual stock with the info we have.""

And on Tuesday, Sen. Warren told Insider that she had seen Insider's investigation, calling out the ""brazenness"" of members and staffers trading stocks even while having access to privileged knowledge.

""We need both tougher laws and enforcement of those laws,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told Insider. ""The American people should never have to guess whether or not an elected official is advancing an issue or voting on a bill based on what's good for the country or what's good for their own personal financial interests."" 

Asked about progressives' position on the issue, a spokesman for Pelosi signaled that the speaker prefers a transparency-focused approach to insider trading.

""The STOCK Act exists to shine a bright light on trades by members of Congress,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant.""

""The speaker does not own any stocks,"" he continued. ""As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked 'SP' for spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.""

Pelosi's husband, investor Paul Pelosi, frequently trades significant numbers of stocks. With her husband's assets considered, Pelosi ranks among the wealthiest members of Congress, according to an Insider analysis.

Insider has identified numerous examples of federal lawmakers trading stocks in industries they oversee as part of their congressional committee assignments, including within the defense, healthcare, and energy industries.

lbuhp0,stocks,GME short squeeze what comes next part 2,"**EDIT: Added a warning because people in the comments seem to think I’m trying to manipulate people**

**WARNING: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RISKY PLAY: THERE ARE NO METRICS OR CURRENT DATA TO PROVIDE SOLID DD TO HAVE A MORE “CERTAIN” OUTCOME. WHAT YOU ARE TRULY BETTING ON IS OTHER PEOPLE. I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG**

Hello all, 

I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why.

**First let's talk about yesterday**

There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades).

Another large thought about why the price should have gone **up** yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities.

1. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2. They haven't covered yet

I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp). So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create ""phantom shares"" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. ""With [forward contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp), a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the [long position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp). This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations."" From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's.

Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. 

So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can [read about it here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf). Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this.

Now, I'm not saying ""nobody sold"" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. 

Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time.

**Today**

So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons.

1. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there.
2. GameStop [adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.html) They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking.

Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. 

Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. 

So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. 

My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. 

So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. 

But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh.

Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. 

So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze.

**So when will this second squeeze happen?**

If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst.

**In summary**

I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. 

Positions:

1100 GME @ $16 closed

500 GME @ $20 closed

50 GME @ $120 open

236 GME @ $250 open

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity.

Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever.

l98jee,stocks,GME end financial culture: how this meme is becoming a serious thing,"It is the first time that the financial market is being used against the same monsters who bet on the failures of companies and enjoy manipulating the markets and impoverishing investors.

At least, it is the first time it is happening in front of my eyes and I can actively be part of it.

What is happening has become very serious, but it is experienced with that romanticism and irony that is not often seen in the world of the stock market.

The thing that no one mentions, however, is the incredible contribution that the GME affair is making to global financial culture. Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what's going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.

The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.

This wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.

In short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.

This meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that's hitting us is giving.

This, ~~gentlemen,~~ ladies and gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up. And each one of you is a part of it. And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say ""f\*\*k money, that time we were the protagonists"".

Be honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?

This is why what is happening is not a meme anymore. The world will be different afterwards.

**tl;dr**

The GME Affair is changing the world's financial culture forever. No more financial ignorance, no more ""under the mattress"" investments. No more underhanded economic power plays.

usojm9,stocks,"Melvin Capital, hedge fund torpedoed by the GameStop frenzy, is shutting down.","https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/business/melvin-capital-gamestop-short.html

Melvin Capital, the hedge fund run by Gabe Plotkin that struggled with heavy losses last year as it reeled from wrong-way bets on GameStop, is shutting down, according to a letter sent to investors on Wednesday that was reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Plotkin wrote to his investors that he had decided that the “appropriate next step” was to liquidate the fund’s assets and return cash to all investors. Mr. Plotkin, who founded Melvin in 2014, also wrote that he recognized he needed to “step away from managing external capital.” 

Mr. Plotkin, a protégé of the hedge fund billionaire and New York Mets owner Steven A. Cohen, had wagered that shares GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other mall mainstays from the 1990s would fall as their businesses shrank. Instead, the stocks skyrocketed when amateur investors, coordinating via Reddit, Twitter and other social media sites and determined to outsmart big Wall Street funds, kept buying up shares and propping up their price. That caused Melvin, which had $8 billion in assets under management in January 2021, to lose billions of dollars as it scrambled to cover its so-called short positions. It was propped up by a $2.75 billion bailout from the hedge funds Point72, run by Mr. Cohen, and Citadel, as well as fresh capital from new investors. Before deciding to shutter his fund, Mr. Plotkin had considered reconstituting it. The decision to close Melvin, which Mr. Plotkin named after his late grandfather, is a blow to Mr. Plotkin’s reputation. He had gained fame as one of the most successful portfolio managers to emerge from Mr. Cohen’s former hedge fund, SAC Capital.",2022-05-18 22:28:06,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640090,650 days 23:42:17.640090,1720,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/usojm9/melvin_capital_hedge_fund_torpedoed_by_the/

President Joe Biden on Wednesday called on U.S. oil refining companies to produce more, saying they need to help alleviate the burden of high prices on consumers. “At a time of war – historically high refinery profit margins being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable,” the president said in a letter to oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Chevron. ″[C]ompanies must take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product,” the letter added. Biden’s call comes as sky-high energy costs add to inflationary concerns across the economy. The national average for a gallon of gas crossed $5 over the weekend for the first time on record, according to AAA. 

The national average now stands at $5.014, which is 54 cents more than a month ago, and $1.94 more than last year. Refiners can’t just ramp up output, with utilization rates already above 90%. Additionally, some refiners are now being reconfigured to make alternate products like biofuel. Refining capacity has dropped since the pandemic took hold, which is a factor in the rapid advance of fuel prices. Demand has returned as economies restart and people travel once again, but supply remains tight.

Still, there is no easy solution. John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, said refiners are working at historically high level. “There is nothing left to ramp up,” he said. Kilduff noted that no new refineries have been built in decades, but existing units have been expanded. Prior to the pandemic, there had been excess refining capacity, which pressured profits. “Years of sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and now Russia, has more than contributed to the current situation,” he said. The industry says the administration’s policies are to blame for the surge in prices. “While we appreciate the opportunity to open increased dialogue with the White House, the administration’s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas have compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies’ daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions,” Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said Wednesday.",2022-06-15 16:01:55,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640092,623 days 06:08:28.640093,56,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vcxv04/biden_tells_us_oil_companies_in_letter_your_well/

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*

In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

px5pjh,stocks,Zillow is paying above market price for houses,"A few weeks ago, Zillow offered me $30,000 above market value (in writing) for my house. My house was listed on the MLS and they could’ve offered the sales price if they wanted, but they offered $30,000 over that. A neighbor without a realtor was offered and accepted $75,000 (20%) over market value. I don’t know if the purpose is to put some money into assets to avoid paying taxes, to meet a quota, or simply to manipulate the real estate market. Just thought I’d post this. I used to own Zillow stock but sold it in May.

Edit: For clarification, based on recent comparable sales, I listed my house for sale at $350k, another neighbor behind us with similar square footage for $345k. Then the neighbor across the street with similar square footage (but a lot that’s a little bigger) said she had sold to Zillow for $430k. I contacted Z and they offered me $380k. It’s true that housing market is crazy here and houses are selling above list price in many instances. I just don’t understand why Z offered so much more than market value based on recent sales when the public isn’t offering that much.",2021-09-28 12:51:06,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640100,883 days 09:19:17.640100,2539,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/px5pjh/zillow_is_paying_above_market_price_for_houses/
ljr9dr,stocks,"If you want to be successful don’t get greedy. Remember that bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.","A colleague just started trading.  I recommended a strong stock I’ve done good DD on but cautioned it will take awhile to see any gains.

A few weeks later it increased 20% on some good news and then dropped 5% for net 15%.  He’s texting me days later “wtf poison_ivey this stock blows, when is it going to take off??”

With all the recent hype some people are looking for X00% overnight and expect massive gains with no effort.  It’s also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and FOMO creeps in.

The key success here is don’t get greedy.   Take your profits and protect your capital core.  Every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet.  Lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder

My average annual return is 20%.  It’s not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means I will retire a lot sooner than I thought I ever could.  If one of my tickers hits bigger than I thought I reassess value and often I take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way

If you could afford to invest $1k per year you could retire w over a million, and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year.

Compound interest at a rate of return of 20% after
20 years = $275k ($20k invested @ $1k per year.
25 years = $775k ($25k invested @$1k per year).
30 years = $1.3M ($30k invested @$1k per year).

After 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of $78k with a passive 6% interest without eroding that core $1.3M.

Start small and be patient.  Decide what percentage of your capital you are willing to go YOLO on and what amount you need to protect to avoid that “holy crap what have I done I’ve lost everything and I’m going to vomit” feeling.

Edit:  I’ve been investing 7 years.  So as many have commented that isn’t long enough to have seen a huge dip and I agree.  I don’t want to mislead.

The point of this post was not to say 20% forever is easy or hard or that everyone should expect that.  The point is to protect your capital and take small risks to learn and build.

Figure out how much pre-tax $$ you need to live every year and divide that by 5%.  That’s what you need to retire.

lxjb9x,stocks,To whoever just posted about having suicidal thoughts (or to anyone else feeling down),"Please realize that no amount of money is worth losing your life over. If you’re feeling stuck, I promise you there’s a way out. Ask yourself: what do you like to do? Do you like people? Look for a sales job and work your way up. Do you like traveling? Try and save some money, move to Latin America (edit: or somewhere else abroad) and teach kids English while living in a much more affordable tropical place. Feeling isolated? Reach out to one person who you would be happy to talk to. There are always solutions. 

I know it’s easy to feel isolated, especially now. But I love each and every one of you, and I don’t even have to know you personally because you are all my brothers and sisters from a cosmic perspective. 

If anyone is feeling down, please DM me and id be happy to chat. No one should suffer alone.

Edit: so happy to see so much love on this post. Thank you all for the awards. 

Also, I am not trying to offer a one size fits all solution to depression/anxiety. I was in a very dark place after my sister died and was dealing with a bunch of external pressures that exacerbated my anxiety/depression. I am just trying to give EXAMPLES of questions one COULD ask themselves if they are feeling stuck, from my perspective. 

I may be overly optimistic, but I believe the universe has a place for each of us and no harm can come from continuing to hope for a better tomorrow. Peace and love my brothers and sisters.

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

&#x200B;

**On Wednesday, the movie theater chain launched a new portal on its website just for its retail investors. The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain’s loyalty program, contains “special offers” and company updates.**

One of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.

AMC’s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. 

The company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.

CEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and “make their important voices heard.”

Aron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) — a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as “Silverback.” AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, “following” hundreds of accounts tied to the “ape army.”

AMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company’s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.

“During my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I’ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC’s owners,” Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. “With AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.”**",2021-06-02 12:03:20,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640106,1001 days 10:07:03.640106,994,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nqk7qi/amc_to_offer_free_popcorn_and_exclusive/

Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen became a billionaire thanks to insider trading. How is he not in jail? On top of insult, he bailed out Melvin Capital* and is allowed to buy the NY Mets.

This pisses me off because most of us on Reddit are investing our hard earned money one day at a time. We are doing it honestly and are still getting better yearly returns than Wall Street. These guys are playing with house money, cheating, breaking the law and becoming billionaires.

Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.

Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.

As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.

The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.

The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.

Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.

s2pl5n,stocks,Josh Hawley and Jon Ossoff offer bills to end stock trading by members of Congress,"Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia are introducing competing bills to end stock-trading by members of Congress.

A key difference between the proposals is reportedly that Ossoff's bill includes dependent children — who may have access to the same privileged information as their lawmaking parent — while Hawley's does not. The two also differ on the enforcement mechanism.

Violators of Ossoff and Kelly's bill would be fined the entirety of their congressional salaries. The freshman senator narrowly defeated former Sen. David Perdue last year amid the Georgia Republican's own stock-trading scandal.

On the other hand, Hawley's bill would require violators to forfeit any profits gained from stock-trading directly to the US Treasury.

qmjr7o,stocks,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.

I am not  saying that asking about market condition is wrong but there are stocks  that don't and won't dip on days like these, less risky, more stable but  less sexy also. It's your choice to buy a risky investment and please  be prepared to see some losses along the way.

GME  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and I am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble, market correction. Yes some stocks are overvalued but we are in  totally uncharted waters given so much money printing, covid but also  investor beliefs in certain markets.

You  are buying stocks like AAPL and MSFT at high valuations, you are not  that person that bought apple in 2003 and has 120000% gains. Please be  weary about the other side of your trades - there are people taking huge  profits - if we will have a lot of them in a span of 10-15-30-120 days  we might see a market correction.

If  you are new to investing buying a stock feels like a very intimate  moment, sadly, a lot of people already own/owned that stock.

If  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.

And for the love of god  don't call yourself a ""long term investor"" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know. We might see a bunch of people soon using that  term more often to offset that psychological game of chess with the  market but in reality you are simply not realizing that losses. I am  100% sure these LTIs are going to sell their position once breaking  even.

Stock market is a game of  psychological chess and if you are weak - you will be wiped out by  people with time, money and huge balls.

Please create daily/monthly/yearly threads designed for a discussion about bubble/correction or market conditions. There is so much noise it's crazy.

On Thursday, a woman who goes by @botticellibimbo on the platform said the following about the clubs: ""The strip club is sadly a leading indicator, and I can promise y'all we r in a recession, lmao."" ""Me getting stock alerts just to decide whether it's worth it to go to work,"" she further wrote in a subsequent tweet. People took to the comment section of her post to confirm her sentiments about the strip clubs, as well as their own experiences in other industries that seemed to be declining. ""Nah fr, reading all these articles journalists and economists are like we're not in a recession we might not even get one this year or next…like the club is dead babe wym,"" one wrote.

lmmn1g,stocks,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter to find rising stocks,"**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How does it work:**  The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

I had been testing the tool for the past 3 months and had to tweak the program to account for the increased bot activity following the GME hype (remove exact same comments posted multiple times, the same account spamming with one ticker etc.)

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **73%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **247%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+34.6%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

Corsair is the leading manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for games and PC enthusiasts. Another important part of their portfolio is the brand Elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, competitive gamers, and streamers. Currently, their products are in high demand and command a significant price premium against other brands.

**Financials**

Corsair currently has a net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY). They had 84% increase in the sales of gamer and creator peripherals. Net income is 103MM compared to 8.4MM loss last year.

They had a gross margin improvement of 6.9% (lesser availability of parts allowed them to jack up their margins) and paid off $190MM debt in 2020. (Current debt of $321MM with $133MM cash in hand)

**Potential and Hype Factor**

People are increasingly spending more and more time on video games and Corsair caters to the premium segment in this market. Adding to this, the current explosion in Twitch viewership and Corsair’s marketing strategy of sponsoring famous streamers to showcase their premium gear further adds to the product demand.

The company is also benefitting greatly from the changing landscape due to the ongoing Covid crisis. As more and more people stay home and abstain from their regular hobbies, they have turned to digital entertainment with PC gaming being one of the leading contenders.  In fact, video game consumption is currently at an all-time high and is set to explode even further.

**Risk and Competition**

I see 3 major risk factors for Corsair

a. Supply Constraints: They currently have unmet demand due to supply constraints which benefitted their margins. But a more severe supply constraint can negatively affect their revenue and brand image

b. Return to normal: The current growth rate might not be sustainable once the pandemic is over and people can return to their regular lifestyle

c. One firm owns 80% of the outstanding shares: Corsair is majorly controlled by EagleTree Capital which has majority voting power and an 80% ownership of the company

**Conclusion**

Corsair currently has about 20% market share for gaming peripherals and 40% market share for PC components putting them in an ideal situation to capture any future growth. Although there is some risk in terms of supply constraints and return to normal, their brand, product line, and current financials are put them in a very strong position.

According to subscription analytics firm Antenna, Netflix cancellations surged 5x the normal amount following the release of “Cuties.”

Meanwhile, Data analytics firm YipitData reported a similar trend, with the company telling Yahoo Finance that Netflix’s U.S. churn “rose materially” last weekend in the wake of the controversy. As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August — a multi-year high, YipitData added.

Still, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space — regardless of its recent controversies.

Responding to a growing controversy over investing practices, the Federal Reserve on Thursday announced a ban on officials owning individual stocks and limits on other activities as well. The ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, along with senior staff. Future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds. Fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies, nor can they invest in individual bonds, hold agency securities or derivative contracts. The new rules replace existing regulations that, while somewhat restrictive, still allowed members to buy and sell stocks. “These tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. Under the new rules, the officials will have to provide 45 days’ notice in advance of buying or selling any securities that are still allowed. They also will be required to hold the securities for at least a year, and cannot buy or sell funds during “heightened financial market stress,” a news release announcing the moves said.

The rules come on the heels of disclosures that multiple Fed officials had been buying and selling stocks at a time when the central bank’s policies were designed to improve market functioning, particularly during the Covid crisis. Regional presidents Robert Kaplan of Dallas and Eric Rosengren of Boston both resigned shortly after disclosures that they had engaged in trading of individual securities last year. In Kaplan’s case, the moves occurred in large-dollar allotments. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida also had been featured in the reports. Powell also sold securities last year, though they were exchange-traded funds that tracked market indexes.",2021-10-21 18:08:07,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640140,860 days 04:02:16.640140,453,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qcxqn0/fed_to_ban_policymakers_from_owning_individual/
lrrcdk,stocks,GME Gamma Squeeze Part Two?,"Here is what I think happened today. 

Looking at the options chain, 25k $50 call options expiring this Friday were purchased today. Assuming that the delta was .5, that is 1.25 million shares that was bought to gamma hedge. Then the price of the GME stocks started to rise causing a chain reaction in MMs covering.

If you look at the $60 call options, 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was .5, that’s another 1.15 million shares that were purchased to hedge. 

Another 17-18k options were purchased between $51-$59, which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up. 

This is entirely assuming that delta on those were .5. If the Delta was higher = more shares were bought.

We’ve had this shit happen before last month. 

So get ready. If this is a gamma squeeze part II, the fall will be just as fast as the moon.

rbhzkp,stocks,Kellogg to permanently replace striking employees as workers reject new contract,"Kellogg said on Tuesday a majority of its U.S. cereal plant workers have voted against a new five-year contract, forcing it to hire permanent replacements as employees extend a strike that started more than two months ago.

Temporary replacements have already been working at the company’s cereal plants in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee where 1,400 union members went on strike on Oct. 5 as their contracts expired and talks over payment and benefits stalled.

“Interest in the (permanent replacement) roles has been strong at all four plants, as expected. We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said.

Kellogg also said there was no further bargaining scheduled and it had no plans to meet with the union.

The company said “unrealistic expectations” created by the union meant none of its six offers, including the latest one that was put to vote, which proposed wage increases and allowed all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions, came to fruition.

“They have made a ‘clear path’ - but while it is clear - it is too long and not fair to many,” union member Jeffrey Jens said.

Union members have said the proposed two-tier system, in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared to longer-tenured workers, would take power away from the union by removing the cap on the number of lower-tier employees.

Several politicians including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have backed the union, while many customers have said they are boycotting Kellogg’s products.

Kellogg is among several U.S. firms, including Deere, that have faced worker strikes in recent months as the labor market tightens.

m85sp6,stocks,List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doing,"I'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time.

m043o7,stocks,Advice: Literally the only times I have made large strides in my wealth are during a dip/crash/recession. I can't be the only one excited.,"A lot of people (including my parents and me) suffered after 2008. We often hear ppl losing everything and getting set far back in lives. What we DON'T often hear, are people who loaded up in 2008. Regular average people. Those with small savings. Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.

Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that's not even going into real estate.

Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing. They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.

And even if you don't maximize your portfolio, literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run. You can be dense and still make money.

So chill tf out. The dip IS AN OPPORTUNITY. It's a fking GIFT.

We're all familiar with ""buy the dip"". Well, here's the same principles with a minor tweak ""buy the (big) dip"".

There are 3 things for certain: death, tax and the stock market going up in the long run  


EDIT: Based on some of the replies I have to clarify. I am by no mean saying ""THIS IS THE CRASH!"" or ""DON'T INVEST. ONLY DO SO WHEN THERE'S A CRASH!"". I'm merely saying how you should REACT TO/FEEL ABOUT these events. View them as opportunities rather than disasters.

Not knowing wtf was going to happen, I was going to cash out. I called my dad and asked what he thought of the situation.

lbzkbi,stocks,Reminder - Whether you own GME or not - CHANGE YOUR GODDAMN BROKER,"Hello everyone,

Last weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.

Before it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.

This is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:

- General Motors
- Rolls Royce
- Trivago
- Workhorse Group
- Jaguar Health

And [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).

When boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. 

**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.

Here is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):

nanrlu,stocks,I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.,"**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

qamr6g,stocks,The wealthiest 10% of Americans own a record 89% of all U.S. stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html

The wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high that highlights the stock market’s role in increasing wealth inequality. The top 1% gained over $6.5 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the bottom 90% added $1.2 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. The share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10% reached the record high in the second quarter, while the bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, down from 12% before the pandemic. The stock market, which has nearly doubled since the March 2020 drop and is up nearly 40% since January 2020, was the main source of wealth creation in America during the pandemic — as well as the main driver of inequality. The total wealth of the top 1% now tops 32%, a record, according to the Fed data. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half — one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history — came from stocks.


“The top 1% own a lot of stock, the rest of us own a little,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled “the democratization” of stocks. Robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million — many of them held by younger, first-time investors. Yet while the market may be owned more broadly, the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed. Rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous, they are also still small, with the average account size at Robinhood at about $4,500. When markets rise, they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings.


“Many of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices, compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains,” Rosenthal said. What’s more, many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality — buying and selling stocks rapidly, with leverage, in hopes of quick gains. While the strategy can create big winners, others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term. The top 10% saw the value of their stocks gain 43% between January 2020 and June of 2021, according to the Fed. The bottom 90% saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate — 33%. “They might account for a larger share of trading activity, but that’s different from ownership and wealth,” Rosenthal said.",2021-10-18 13:31:31,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640170,863 days 08:38:52.640170,846,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qamr6g/the_wealthiest_10_of_americans_own_a_record_89_of/

qi92fg,stocks,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",2021-10-29 09:39:43,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640245,852 days 12:30:40.640245,715,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/
n392a4,stocks,Twitter (TWTR) has done basically nothing in its entire publically-traded history,"I started investing in late 2013 and TWTR was the hot IPO at the time. I distinctly remember buying a few shares at $57 figuring I'd get in on the ground floor of what was already a culturally-significant company. 

Amazingly, over 7 years later the stock is trading lower than where I bought it all those years ago. TWTR has never paid a dividend or split their stock, so in effect they've created zero wealth for the general public over their entire public existence. I sold my shares for a wash in 2014, but I'd have been shocked to hear they'd still be kicking around the same spot in 2021. In an era of social media, digital advertising and general tech dominance, it's a remarkable failure.

On the one hand it provides a valuable lesson that a company still has to succeed financially, and not just have a compelling narrative. Pay attention to the bottom line - hype alone does not a business make. On the other hand, what the hell? Twitter has created verbs. It's among the most-visited websites in the world. We've just had 4 years of a Twitter presidency. Yet Twitter has seen its younger brother (SQ) lap it in terms of value.

ipp3e9,stocks,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash. We are seeing [record insider selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/investing/insider-selling-stocks-market/index.html), but most publicly, it began with Tesla announcing they would sell $5bn in [new shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/tesla-to-sell-up-to-5-billion-in-stock-amid-rally.html). Their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently ""[rebalancing](https://fortune.com/2020/09/04/tesla-stock-rally-investors-selling-outlook/)"" their portfolio to sell many Tesla shares as well. This was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market, even though it did anyway. I will get more in depth on this phase later. The biggest catalyst was [Softbank](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-dives-6-u-tech-004748400.html), though, and that leads me to the final stage.
5. **Panic Selling**: This is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can. We are currently witnessing this. The last few days have been a trainwreck on the market, wiping out August's gains entirely.

Now I know you want to say ""well look at today. We're up 2% in the S&P!"" This is par for the course on a crash. With the Corona crash, these were the rough day to day movement patterns (I'm using Corona as an example for its shortness/simplicity but all crashes have similar patterns):

* 1 small loss day 
* 2 BIG loss days 
* 3 medium loss days 
* 5 ***gain days*** (there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the March crash) 
* 1 GIANT loss day 
* 3 Sideways days 
* 8 slightly down days, leading to the bottom 

Of those gain days, the first was a slowdown, but the second was a change of 4.8% in S&P/SPY from an open of 294 to a close of 309. Consecutive, positive days occurred during every major crash. We can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting. Don't be fooled by positive days. That does NOT indicate the crash is over. Novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat. Crashes take weeks, minimum, but **usually months, if not years**, to become fully realized. Covid's crash is the fastest we've had at one month.

Another trend I've noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster. The late 80's Japanese market crash took 6 years to play out. The 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years. The Chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years. The 2008 oil bubble took 1 year. On the flipside, the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years. The 2008 energy bubble took 3 years. We're about 6 months into this current bubble, but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid. Maybe this means nothing, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Bubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse. I've been seeing these called ""violent shake-offs."" Most crashes get one, but some get two. We had one with the June mini-crash. One could argue that this current crash could be a violent shake-off. I'll get to the alternate scenario later. Assuming it's not, which I don't think it is, we move to the final trigger, the catalyst.

**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank. They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

To those who don't know, Softbank bought $4 billion in options during the early days of the market post-covid. These options are worth a fortune right now ($30bn estimated), but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on. What everyone is afraid of is Softbank doing just that, or worse, for shareholders: holding through a market crash and losing it all. In the movie, Margin Call (great movie), a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold EVERYTHING they had in order to get ahead of it, single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash. To be fair, this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion, but it's really just mentioned to illustrate my point. Softbank has to exercise these options, which have strike prices likely WAY below market value. If they sell those shares, they could easily double their investment, even through a crash. The problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that Softbank lost over $15 billion in market cap (currently at $112bn). Had this not happened, the speed at which we decline would've been much slower. They have to make those losses up now. You know what would do that? Exercising all their options and selling them for market gains.

They can't keep those options forever, either. At best they have 2 years. Softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market, but if it keeps dipping, they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically, promoting a panic selling cycle. And what are we in? A panic selling cycle.

If this cycle continues with Softbank, more will tack on and we'll see this bubble continue to collapse. If it can hold a recovery this week, it might survive, but of course, I don't think it will. The end of day today really showed that people *are* afraid and that given any opportunity, selloff will occur. I think this IS the crash. But, I could be wrong. That brings me to the second and third catalysts.

**Commercial Real Estate Crash**: The eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy. It's brushed under the rug pretty heavily, pointing to the home real estate market and its gains, but the damage is done. Most major commercial real estate buildings, especially apartments, are in disarray. Go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering. Where I am, I'm seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places. I've never seen that before. Everyone is desperate for paying tenants. Most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing, but we haven't seen anything like this. Small businesses are shutting down, new businesses are not opening. No one is shopping. Who replaces those lost tenants? All these properties are heavily in debt. That's how the industry works, for the most part. Entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and it's a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment. The margins had become abysmal before corona. I once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that I would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing, to make anything worthwhile. This will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast. There is a commercial real estate collapse coming, likely within 6 months, and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done. Don't forget that this isn't strictly a US problem. This is a worldwide problem.

**Vacation Industry Crash:** Many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat. This, in turn, boosts GDP. Malaysia, for instance, is a place I personally visited, during Covid, and it was a desolate wasteland. Most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer. It was like this for blocks and blocks. Huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people. It's only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses. The country in Malaysia I visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants, during the best of times. Now, they are lucky to get any customers. That affect will bleed into the second catalyst. More businesses going under, causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them, causing those buildings to go under, causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant, unprofitable properties, causing them to go under.

Even with a vaccine, we won't go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses. The airline industry is reporting that they don't estimate returns to normal until late 2021, early 2022. Do you think a random Joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought? The people at the bottom of the chain, consumers and small business owners, were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives. That *is* going to trickle up to the top and when it does, goodbye market.

Of course, there's also the US election, but that will be a small catalyst as far as I'm concerned.

\------------------------------------------------

Other notable indicators/insights that things don't look good:

1. Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.
2. Google trend results for ""Market Crash"" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.
3. An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.
4. EVs are the new dotcom company. Many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated.
5. High growth, high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies, despite stock prices pretending they do. For example, Sea Ltd. doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in Q2 2020. eToys is a prime example of this, from the dotcom bust era. Had huge revenue, but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business, despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good.
6. The PE ratio of the market is above 30, which has historically always resulted in a market crash.
7. Apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today. Prior to that was around 600k peak. This happened for MOST tech stocks.
8. If you bought Microsoft at peak dotcom bust, you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven (longer if you account for inflation losses). That kind of stagnation is what we're looking at, even today.

\------------------------------------------------

This does NOT mean the entire market will crash. Quite the contrary. Yes, most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors (TECH) brings down the whole thing, but they will stay high if priced fairly. Most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area, for instance, and will weather the storm quite well. At least, until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them.

Plan accordingly, set stop losses, and do your own research. I don't expect you to just follow my information blindly. I may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires. You need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call. I simply hope to raise awareness for what I believe is a market crash so that people don't lose their shirt during this. I hope I'm wrong, though I'm literally betting with my money that I'm not.

**Has the Squeeze Been Sqoze? Absolutely not**

**Will the squeeze be sqoze? Potentially** 

**Strap in. This is going to be exhaustively long, but I have a lot to say.**

**Please** see my other work. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything. I am not a shill, I am not here for confirmation bias, I am a pragmatic, neutral party. Anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper DD on **me.** If you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate I have been thus far. Even in Part 5 I nearly perfectly predicted all of Friday's entire movements. 

**Note:** That does not mean I will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga. I also am not saying all of this to flex, it's because I am tired of being called a shill when I was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate. This doesn't mean you should take what I am saying as truth, but it does mean that if it doesn't align with your thoughts you should probably put down the kool-aid, loosen up the tin-foil hat, and listen to someone else's opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

I am not a financial advisor, in fact, this isn't even advice. It is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been. One thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes. If people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in, please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say. 

**I also want to make it crystal clear that I think the squeeze has not been sqoze, however, the landscape is very different now.**

Finally, any PT’s including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict. Please do not take these as certain numbers. It’s the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens Monday.

# So What Happened Friday?

For the sake of this not being an entire novel, I encourage you to read Part 5 as I think that prediction is precisely what happened. To summarize, we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point, volume wasn't enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through, that's when selling and more shorting occurred. The price dipped down to around 88. Now, I didn't mention this in the DD but I did mention it in the comments section that I expect interesting price action around 2pm. Why? Because of the call options expiring ITM. 

I think these shares were already covered. I know we expect a higher price increase, but why? Where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions? 

Total Options That Expired On 02/26 ITM: **22,713** [Data from here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows)

This would equate to **2,271,300** shares 

At **13:02** the price fell to **\~86,** this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day. By **13:07** there was a volume of over **20,000,000** in the buying direction. 

Not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered. 

At **13:07** alone there was a positive net change in volume of **17,656,000** nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered...within 1 minute. 

The rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to **\~121**. Then it began falling off again, as did volume. 

Now, ask yourself...why would this be the case? Because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing, this was the ITM calls being covered. 

*At this point I'm sure you're ready to stop reading and call me a shill, but I encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next. This may not fit your narrative, and that's ok. A squeeze is possible, it might just be time to think that it won't be happening quite the way you imagined.*

# Before we move on to what comes next, let's play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding. 

For some reason, people still believe that holding your shares is preventing HF's from covering. I cannot express how untrue this sentiment is. Holding is a valid play, but it absolutely **should not** be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts. A 5 second look at any chart could show you there is **more than enough** sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them.

Let's take the largest post on r/gme as an example.

The top post of all time received **59,600** upvotes. According to the comments most people are actually holding only about 1-10 shares each. But for the sake of the argument let's get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns **100** shares of GME. Let's also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys.

That's a total of **5,960,000** shares that are being tucked away so HF's can't get their grubby little paws on them. On Friday alone, **91,960,000** shares were exchanged. So even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from. 

Holding is certainly a valid play, but there are two things holding certainly does not do:

1. It does not increase the price of a stock
2. It does not prevent HF's from covering

If you are holding solely because of these two reasons, then you are playing this wrong. There are three reasons to actually hold:

1. You absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent, so you are patiently waiting for it to occur.
2. You are already positioned extremely well like DFV who has a cost basis of 26.7896
3. You are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake, you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable. 

**If you don't believe me, then please examine the evidence.**

When you purchase a stock the price goes up, when you sell a stock the price goes down. So what happened when RH restricted trading? The price plummeted. Why? Because holding and selling were the only options.

Let's play another absurd game and pretend that 100% of shareholders held when trading was restricted. The price would have gone completely sideways, it would not have gone up or down.

But let's be realistic, that will never happen. Even if retail traders decided to hold, institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up. No, no. They are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense. You call them allies which they are not, they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100% gains while everyone else is waiting for 10,000% gains.

I want to pause for a moment in this DD and take a moment to point something out. Even though I'm not trying to convince anyone to sell, I have been called all sorts of names as though I'm evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation. But let's be absolutely clear. **You are the ones peer pressuring people into holding. You are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative. You are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope.** 

If you have made it this far, congratulations, I would love to have a discussion regarding the ""hold"" play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above. 

# My Thesis

My thesis remains the same, **the shorts want a short squeeze.** Yes, this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this. They need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round. They are reporting their losses publicly...but they have not disclosed their gains. 

I think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze. They open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers FOMO and market purchasing as well. This allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene. 

Once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak, they begin shorting on the way down, opening new, extremely favorable positions. The gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable ones...by a lot. 

Institutional traders are not stupid, they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze. They ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls. As I mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100% gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the Earth. 

So institutions ride it up, sell at the top, where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down. They then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again. Rinse and repeat.

I think the idea of the [Interstellar Yo-Yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/) was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component, ""Snidely"" in the story is *intentionally* doing this. 

A circumstance like GME will never happen again, when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that don't allow these kinds of things to happen. Institutions and HF's would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can.

So my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground. 

**Let's think about that for a moment.**

If your original PT on GME was $1000, you are already almost there.

The first squeeze took the price from \~$12 to \~$500, \~$488 increase.

The second squeeze took the price from \~$40 to $200, \~$160 increase.

So, already GME has increased around $648. You are now only a $352 increase away from your $1000 PT.

**Is a massive short squeeze still possible?**

**Yes.** However, so much of the DD floating around is all talking about *possibility* but we as investors don't care about that. We care about *probability.* 

So what is the probability of a massive short squeeze? Well, there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as Cohen joining the board. I think there are still several catalysts which I outline in [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). There could very well be new catalysts that I have not mentioned since that post, such as Cohen getting appointed CEO as I have learned many believe based on his Tweet. 

Let's talk numbers.

There are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible. 

$170 - This is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce, but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number.

$200 - This is a MASSIVE sell wall. Why? Well, I think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned. Probably not right at $200, they probably shorted \~$205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall.

If this sell wall falls, it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze *however* it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the $200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period. 

If this happens, it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over $400. At this point, FOMO + shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over $1000.

**But what is the** ***probability*** **that this will happen?**

Without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume.

Let's consider the first squeeze and volume for reference.

**Jan 22nd:** This was the highest volume at **197,157,900,** the high was 76.76 and the low was 42.32

Absolutely insane volume, but it didn't move the price all that much (I mean at least in comparison to other days)

**Jan 25th:** Volume **177,874,000 H:**159.18 **L:** 61.13

**Jan 26th:** Volume **178,588,000 H:**150.00 **L:** 80.20

**Jan 27th:** Volume **93,396,700 H:** 380.00 **L:** 249.00

**Jan 28th:** Volume **58,815,800 H:** 483.00 **L:** 112.25

**Jan 29th:** Volume **50,259,200 H:** 413.98 **L:** 250.00  


See the pattern?

**25th:** 177M volume to nearly triple the price (160%)

**26th:** Even more volume to only double the price (87%)

**27th:**  Half the volume for a 52% increase 

The volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasing/decreasing, with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted. These first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze. 

The 28th and beyond trading was restricted, but if everyone could only sell or hold, why wouldn't the price immediately fall? How could there still be support? This was shorts covering. Between just those two days there was \~109,000,000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell. A *perfect* time for shorts to cover. 

**But I thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up?** 

Absolutely...if trading wasn't restricted. Because virtually everyone could only sell, this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction FUD. 

So, as strange as it seems, I think the price going up was *some* shorts covering but for the most part, I think they covered while the price was falling. I know this *seems* counter-intuitive, but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered, the amount of selling was able to drive the price down *while* they covered. Again, think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted, *someone* was buying massive amounts of shares as the price fell...and it wasn't us.

**So, Hooman, if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible?**

Because of my thesis, entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions. Perhaps some of the old HF's also did to try to recoup some losses. Last week we *almost* forced this to happen all over again, but a TON of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at $200 prevented us from tipping that very important, very first domino. This isn't the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down, this is a different situation entirely. 

That situation is *still* squeezable. The question is...how?

Volume. Volume. Volume.   
Sheer and pure buying power.

We would *need* those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that $200 sell wall AND hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close. We were so damn close but couldn't quite break it. This is precisely why my predictions for Friday were so accurate.

A catalyst, a whale, large global sentiment again, FOMO; there are A LOT of different ways this is *possible,* but as I mentioned before; we as investors deal with *probable.*

In one of my original posts, long before this became a meme stonk, I literally used the word **imminent**  in the title, that's how sure I was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm. If you now notice, all of my titles are **What Comes Next?** That is because this is the honest truth: literally no one knows. Why? Because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and FOMO has worn off, more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum. 

This has gone from a sure thing, **to a straight up gamble.** 

If I had to give it a probability, which I really don't want to do I would have to say 50/50. There is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past $200, but it is still *possible* with catalysts and other factors. 

What appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death, people get bored, or a catalyst pops the MOASS's.

But you *can* be certain of one thing: **this will end.**

It does NOT have to end with a MOASS, but it might. My guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the MOASS by April, then this will be on pause. The interesting thing is that the *possibility* of a MOASS might never go away, but as time passes the *probability* lessens. 

The reason for my April guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers. It is very possible that this thing cools down after that, shorts enter unfavorable positions, and then Cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later.

That being said, I think the most *probable* outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly, we are just along the ride for. There is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen, we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next.

[The DD can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/)

*Disclaimer: Both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else. You should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions.*

**Overall Impression:** Well done DD. There was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven. I will say, there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the author's narrative. From a more objective point of view, this simply could have been shorts shorting. From a less objective point of view, it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes. Let't go as chronologically as possible.

""On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!""

""**Conclusion:** Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!""

**My take:** I actually find this quite compelling. Either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell, or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze. Both ideas are equally nuts, but we live in crazy times.

""**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲""

**My Take:** I agree. Large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do. Either that or a whale buyer like Chamath. I also agree with the $50 assumption, as that was a clear battle ground. Where we disagree is I think that last week was in fact, the gamma squeeze. However, we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next, more important domino at $200+.

""On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). ""

**My Take:** Well, first of all I really wish there was a link to this data. But let's go with Fintel's data that shows 33 million short volume on 02/25. If you look at the chart for 02/25 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred. My guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140-180. This is one of the reasons I have been saying that the **135** resistance is a key point. If this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the **170 and 200** point, but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there? I'm not sure. I mean, I hope so! But I'm not sure.

**Anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding, I'm not even going to touch.** Why? Because it doesn't matter.

This goes back to my original point, everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen. But who cares? I think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock. What we need to be asking is WILL the squeeze be squozen and if so HOW?

**March 19th:** Including the options chain, XRT data, FTD's, etc. I think this date could in fact act as a catalyst. But that's about it. To me I would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it. There is a lot of good information backing this theory, but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory. In my opinion, this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either A: spark the MOASS or B: It could be the date of another microsqueeze.

**""MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable.""

**My take:** Absolutely not inevitable. Certainly possible.

# Monday Predictions

Again, this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off. I can't express that enough. That is why holding is gamble that could really go either way. If something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing. My predictions for Monday are based on no new catalysts.

Virtually, I am expecting a repeat of Friday that could end differently.

**Open:** I am expecting a sharp price increase at open, volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go. 

I imagine we will struggle at **115** resistance but we can hopefully blow through that, the real test will come at **135** resistance.

 If we reach **135** and blow through it, then this gets very interesting. I see the next resistance points at **150, 155, and then the really important ones of 170 and 200.** I already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a MOASS.

If we reach **135** but volume is too low (if you're not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it). If it takes more than two attempts, without a significant volume boost I can't imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points.

**Shortly after Open:** My guess right now is still before 10:00 (but it could go later in the day if I'm wrong about people covering on Friday) if we have not broken through those early resistance points, I think the slow bleed will begin. 

My bottom PT is somewhere between 60-80.

Once we hit this mark, it gets difficult to predict. No one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock. The closest I would say would be 40-50 since thats where the greatest support we had was. It is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 60-80 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover, the market see's it as a good point to enter and ride the wave, or if GME is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with.

After that, it's a blur. This truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly I cannot provide this kind of DD every single day. I don't have work Monday so I'm considering live streaming this.

# So What's Your Play Hooman?

Now, some of you will call me a shill\_or\_whatever but I simply have a different tactic. You might believe in the MOASS, but I'm not certain I think it's *probable.* So I will be playing these mircosqueezes instead. 

I mentioned in my last post, I have a really nasty wash sale. From what I understand, this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by $100. IE if I purchase the stock for $80 my cost basis will be adjusted to $180. I'm still unclear on how this works, if someone could clarify in the comments section I would absolutely love to continue playing this stock. I will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well, so if I'm not responsive to the comments like I usually am, please understand I am attempting to prepare for this week.

So...as long as the wash sale isn't an actual reflection of my real price, then I will buy as soon as the market opens. I will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning, **I will buy more there to fight the good fight**. If it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase won't make a difference, then that will be my indicator to sell. 

**This part is vital:** If you are SELLING at the resistance points, you are hurting the cause. BUYING at these points is what will break through the wall. But if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling, then you might as well profit. You holding won't change the fact that we couldn't break resistance. **I can't stress this enough**. If you simply sell when we hit resistance, you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesn't happen. So either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets, but if it is lost no matter what you do, then sell and prepare for another attempt.

Once it gets below 90 I will start scooping up shares again, averaging down with the price (I do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom).

From there I will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again. If it does, I will sell at whatever I think the top is and then will re-enter just before close. Again, if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then I will not sell, I will buy to try to push through that resistance.

Why would I re-enter just before close? Three reasons:

1. I'm better positioned and back on board in case the MOASS does trigger
2. I won't have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on Tuesday.
3. I am bullish on GME thanks to Cohen and would like to re-open my long position.

If the same pattern continues Tuesday, I will repeat this play until the pattern stops and I am sitting on A LOT more shares at a MUCH BETTER cost basis.

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has not been squoze, but it has become closer to 50/50 odds that it will occur. I think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and I will play accordingly. Simply holding does not increase a price, buying does. My play will not only net me profits, but it will increase my buying power significantly. There is no TLDR to justify this post, if you don't feel like reading then you aren't playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways. Just remember, this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze. Happy trading!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, none of this is advice at all. It is my analysis of the situation that I have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand. The only direct advice I have for anyone is you should do what's best for you. I am bullish on GME long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if I end up with bags (as long as they aren't too heavy) that's perfectly fine with me. Anyone who tries to convince you I am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor, I am not even a bear on this situation, but you should always examine the bear case, not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias.*",2021-02-28 19:28:19,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640257,1095 days 02:42:04.640257,1192,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/luo6u5/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_6/

m7id8j,stocks,Why you shouldn’t use Robinhood,"I’ve seen a ton of posts from newer investors on what brokerages to use, and I want to be clear on why you shouldn’t use RH:

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

lhd8gm,stocks,A tip that I heard right when I started trading that has helped keep me sane and grow as an investor,"I've only been trading with real money for about a month, but I read something a few months ago, while doing my research, that really stuck and I wanted to share.

As investors, we often look at the moves we've made and judge ourselves on what we missed on or what we hit on. This is part of growing and learning as an investor.

But the thing that many people forget is the **almost** trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn't. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but *something* made us pass on it. 

#Write them down.#

Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn't make the trade.

This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, ""man - if only I held this longer"" or ""I really messed up buying this on the rise"". But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn't a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.

If you don't record the moves you **almost** made, then you're missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.

Hope this can help others as much as it's helped me. Good luck y'all!

xn1ibc,stocks,"Costco has no plans to change the price of its $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo, despite record high inflation. Membership fee to remain flat.","A top Costco Wholesale executive confirmed the big-box retailer has **no plans to change the price of its $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo at its stores despite months of decades-high inflation.**

**Costco CFO Richard Galanti reiterated the cheap price point on the fan-favorite deal would stay in place during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday.**

An analyst asked whether Costco was adjusting prices in other parts of its business to maintain sales margins for its hot dog-and-soda deal and other value offerings.

“Lightning just struck me,” Galanti joked when the combo was mentioned. He added that higher-margin businesses such as gas and travel sales help Costco maintain its value deals.

“Those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer – forever,” Galanti added.

Costco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year, passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers. Inflation has slightly declined in recent months but was still hovering at a hotter-than-expected 8.3% in August.

 Galanti estimated that price inflation at Costco was about 8% during the fourth quarter, with increases “a little higher on the food and sundries side.”

**Costco doesn’t have any immediate plans to hike its membership fees**, according to the executive. Annual membership dues at the retailer currently start at $60.

 Still, Galanti noted that **membership price increases were likely at some point in the future. Costco has generally hiked its fees roughly every five to six years**.

**“Our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it’s a question of when, not if,”** Galanti said.

Despite the inflationary environment, Costco topped analysts’ expectations in the fourth quarter. The retailer posted quarterly revenue $72.09 billion and earnings per share.

So what do you think the retail investors will be buying this time? 

Tesla and other meme stocks?

Or they have noticed that there is a possible rotation in value stocks and will put it there?

Or will they think, put it on FANG and other high flying tech/renewable energy stocks that have dipped quite a lot the last two weeks?

If it was up to me I will tell them to buy ICLN/IQQH, TDOC, CRSR, NET,  and CSIQ because I have been really hurt by these during the past few weeks and need some support! :-).

kxa9r4,stocks,"After 8 months of trial and error, hundreds of hours of Youtube, losing money, almost giving up, I can finally say I made my first $100 trading stocks","I started paper trading and thought that what I was doing was working (looking back at my trades makes me cringe now), so I decided to put $1000 in my account and try it for real.  I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn't cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn't. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark.

If anyone is still reading this, I know what you're thinking: ""Wow, 100 bucks, big deal,"" and you're right. It's not much. However, If an average guy like myself can battle back and grow his account 10% (+30% in two months), I strongly believe that anyone can; with enough dedication. I'd be happy to talk more about my journey to anyone who's interested or just starting out.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments! I’ve been reading almost every one! I knew a lot of people would say that based on my story, trading probably isn't for me, you have a very valid reason for saying so, and you could still be right. I've heard that everyone's trading journey is different, and I'm hoping my journey can continue for much longer. Instead of thinking about how I've only made 10% in 8 months in one of the strongest bull runs, I like to think that I've gone from $850 to $1100 (30% gain) while the SPY has gone up 8% in the past two months.  I hope these type of gains can continue, but time will tell. Even if I can't continue these gains, I've really enjoyed the learning process and think that the knowledge I've gained is beneficial and worth the time to me.

This sub is becoming the epitome of buy high sell low. Everyone talks about how they wish they bought x or y asset “back when it was cheap.” Now things are getting cheap again and instead of staying level headed people are just losing their minds. But it’s funny to me, because it’s people lump sum investing into solid investment during conditions like these that end up walking away as millionaires.

It’s funny also how so many were smug and dismissive about anything that wasn’t an overhyped large cap tech stock and now that’s those are imploding people have no imagination what else to invest in. 

- work hard to maintain an income that affords you enough to invest. Not easy but this should be your priority

- DCA all the way down and then continue DCAing on the eventual return up 

- Put most of your money in global market index funds. Only put a small part of your portfolio towards stocks you do great DD in

lyfatd,stocks,Word of advice from someone who was like many of you:,"I know it's annoying. Another one of those, ""Don't sell, it's going to be okay"" posts.

I used to check my stock app every minute and sold because I got nervous and uncomfortable. I would see gains that have made insane money disappear and sell off trying to hopefully get back at a lower price. From personal experience, I would encourage many of you to take one hard look at your stock portfolio right now and ask yourself if this is a company you see being able to exist in the long-term future. If the answer is no, you should cut some of your position or get rid of it. If the answer is yes, sit back, maybe liquidate a few shares, but don't get uneasy about it. It's the stock market - you win some, you lose some. If the company you own isn't going through a fundamental change such as a huge decrease in revenue or an SEC investigation, stop being upset.

If I never sold a single share of any company from the day I started investing, I would likely be a millionaire right now with an initial investment of $30,000. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy companies you trust and can reasonably see being a sustainable business and just ride it. More often than not, you're going to end up green. From what I see now, there are going to be a ton of opportunities to get in on some stocks soon. You should be putting more attention on what you should buy rather than what you should sell right now.",2021-03-05 16:14:47,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640308,1090 days 05:55:36.640308,1037,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lyfatd/word_of_advice_from_someone_who_was_like_many_of/

v9wqou,stocks,Gasoline prices top $5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher,"The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above $5 nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in Ukraine.

Prices look set to continue rising into the summer months, analysts said.

the average national price reached $5.004 on Saturday. That’s up from about $3.07 a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation. At the end of the week, prices had already averaged $5 or more in about 20 states, with the highest prices on the West Coast.

“By my calculations, the typical household is spending about $160 more on gas a month than a year ago,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That’s a big bite.”

Gasoline prices normally peak in mid-May, but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about 65 cents higher than a month ago. Due to short supplies this year, analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until mid-July, when summer driving season traditionally peaks.

“I don’t think we’re far away” from the highest prices, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “I don’t think it would eclipse $5.50. I would say $5.25 is the top, but again, the market is unhinged.”

However, if there are any serious refinery outages this summer, or disruptions from hurricanes, gasoline prices could spike, he added.

Gasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the U.S. has lost about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, since before the pandemic. At the same time, sanctions on Russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally.

Analysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump, the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a household’s spending as it had been in the past. That is in part due to more efficient vehicles.

According to a CNBC analysis, drivers were spending an estimated average 20 cents per mile on gasoline as of June this year, even with the steep price increases. In 1980, that same mile would have cost 30 cents in today’s dollars.",2022-06-11 12:39:17,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640335,627 days 09:31:06.640335,2151,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v9wqou/gasoline_prices_top_5_a_gallon_nationally_for_the/
t8t9ep,stocks,Biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters

**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but ""it is likely just the U.S if it happens”**

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.

So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said.

At the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.

""This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,"" a White House official said.

A year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.

s62x5o,stocks,Why I fail to see how the Metaverse will succeed,"I've read that a lot of people here are super bullish on the Metaverse and various ""digital words""

As a VR consumer and developer I however am very skeptical that the masses will flock to an digital world.

The metaverse is not a new concept, its been around since the 90s if not further back. There is already a form of metaverse called ""Second life"" where you can own properties, join communities and pretty much ""live"" in a real world.

&#x200B;

Now I know a lot of people will say that we simply don't know the possibilities yet and we are thinking too simple minded but let's be creative. What could be some use cases that people would prefer doing digital vs real life?

Metaverse cinema? Yeah that already exists in current VR games and it's really not that fun and you obviously can't recreate the pixel density nor the actual sound acoustic that a lot of people don't get from their home system.

&#x200B;

Meetings? Yeah I guess if you prefer to strap a VR headset on you and be forced to see your digital coworkers instead of having a 2D Teams screen where you can actually do something else than stare at your coworkers during the meeting.

&#x200B;

Dating? I almost don't want to go into this. Are you telling me a digital date would surpass the actual real life vision of a human, the smells, the toucing hand? 

&#x200B;

Virtual jog by the beach? I literally saw this example on the sub. You think people would really want to jog in a virtual beach oppose to actually going outside?

&#x200B;

Whatever the metaverse is it will be a subpar experience to the real thing. Unless we can advance graphic rendering by a hella of a lot or actually tapping into our senses I fail to see how the metaverse would ""awe"" anyone. 

&#x200B;

If we do go fully Inception, ""simulation"" reality then we got bigger issues than the Metaverse.

&#x200B;

With that said I still think it could be future revenue in this field but it won't be as massive as some people here think.",2022-01-17 12:28:53,2024-02-28 22:10:23.640337,772 days 09:41:30.640337,2469,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/s62x5o/why_i_fail_to_see_how_the_metaverse_will_succeed/

m3c0lk,stocks,Roblox is insanely overpriced,"I know that no one likes a bear and furthermore people feel connected to this stock since their kids play the game or because it's a video game and it's fun to invest in that stuff but facts over feelings when dealing with money because it has no feelings. So first we have to base our value, the company raised 528 million$ from private sources last year at a valuation of 28 billion dollars. It later went public via direct listing at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion  in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft's 350 million. Now let's go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx's 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in revenue but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from  the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax  Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. The last showing of this is Sony's purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. Final note: EA's entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead,  NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.

Edit: **This is my opinion not advice.** To play devils advocate since a lot of people like the stock here you go: Roblox has doubled it's earnings every year since 2017 and had record revenue of almost 950 million this past year. It's player base is also massive and almost doubling every year just like it's revenue. It also has 830 million in the bank right now and can easily grow by going to Asia and or incorporating more adult themes. Now other than the fact that it's trading 40x P/S you have to bet that the game will both keep growing and making profits at the same pace as now which I don't see but here there u go.",2021-03-12 06:49:18,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406153,1083 days 15:21:07.406154,1469,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/

Then adjusted his timeline to Jan-Feb 2022. He sold out of several stocks in November. Then went all in last two weeks of December thinking there would be rally in Jan 2022. Just a couple days ago he was still super bullish saying stuff would rebound. Made a video slamming Bill Ackman for shorting market in March 2020. And blamed ""the suits"" for manipulating the market. He went from that to suddenly selling out of 99.9% of his portfolio and is now shorting the market.

I don’t think for a second that any meaningful loan forgiveness is coming; and if it is, that’s going to cause its own problems.

o1jm8m,stocks,A note to young investors (or new investors),"As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.

Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)

In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...

After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.

What have I learned?

Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  ""YOLOing"" your rent check is never a good idea.

Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.

Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.

Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.

It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.

I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D

sfjfds,stocks,Moderna’s HIV Vaccine Has Officially Begun Human Trials,"Few people have been hit harder during the COVID-19 pandemic than those who are immunocompromised — including people whose immune systems have been ravaged by HIV/AIDS. But that dark chapter of medical history may soon be drawing to a close. That’s the hope in Washington, D.C., at least, where scientists with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Moderna have announced that human trials for the company’s experimental HIV vaccine have officially begun.

“We are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform,” said IAVI president and CEO Mark Feinberg in the announcement. “The search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.” Human candidates, recruited for clinical trials last August, received the study’s first shots on Thursday at George Washington University’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The vaccine builds on technology developed by Moderna during their COVID-19 vaccine production, with the goal of using mRNA to boost HIV immunogens and prevent the virus from disabling B cells, which are essential to fighting disease.

Although medicines like PrEP and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have proved somewhat effective in slowing the spread of HIV and reducing its mortality, the virus is still a threat to global health nearly forty years after it was first identified. Scientists hope to conclude human trials next year in 2023, coinciding with HIV’s grim 40th anniversary. “We believe advancing this HIV vaccine program in partnership with IAVI and Scripps Research is an important step in our mission to deliver on the potential for mRNA to improve human health,” said Moderna president Stephen Hoge. Only time will tell whether this vaccine will succeed where others have failed — but we’ll be praying, crossing our digits, and wishing on every star that by next year, LGBTQ+ communities around the globe will have a new reason to celebrate.

mk9aak,stocks,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years","The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

obxqrc,stocks,Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable,"TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.

My god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “omni-channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.

Krispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.

So now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.

In the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale.

rrhoka,stocks,To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%,"Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"".  They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  
XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  
DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

 New US requirements will put Tesla under pressure to open up its EV charging network to rivals, per Reuters.

* If it doesn't, it could miss out on getting in on the $7.5 billion in charger subsidies planned by Biden.
* Tesla's 40,000+ EV chargers can only be used by its cars, but officials told Reuters that could change.

 

Tesla could find itself locked out of $7.5 billion in Biden administration subsidies if it fails to open its EV charging network up to competitors, according to a Reuters report.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

Musk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally.",2023-02-13 12:44:53,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406320,380 days 09:25:32.406321,940,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1117dd2/tesla_faces_a_75_billion_ultimatum_open_up_its/

""On March 31, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the “Company” or “GameStop”) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 through an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) in order to implement a stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock in the form of a stock dividend and provide flexibility for future corporate needs. GameStop also intends to request stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting for a new incentive plan (the “2022 Equity Plan”) to support future
compensatory equity issuances. If the 2022 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders, it will replace the current GameStop Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, plus any shares subject to the 2019 Plan that expire, are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash after the 2022 Plan is effective, will be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan.

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. 

 Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

 Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. 

""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers.

oxebmu,stocks,You don’t own Chinese company stocks when you buy Chinese company shares.,"This might be a good time to write about this since there is a major sell off and lot of you might think you can buy Chinese stocks for a low price. Cramer might say whatever but it’s your job to research into the stock you buy. 

You don’t actually own the stock of the Chinese company shares that are bought via American or any other world exchanges. CCP laws do not allow foreigners to own shares in a Chinese entity. You actually own shares of a shell company located in the Cayman Islands that has the same name as the Chinese stock you own. This shell company has certain economic agreements with the Chinese company so that the share holders of the shell company get economic benefits. You can read more in the below link. 

This kind of a structure leads to a lot of issues. One of them is low blowing American investors after the Chinese companies becomes profitable. Basically Chinese companies are listed in the US and use US investors capital to become profitable and then are taken private at a low price before re-listing in China for a far higher price. 

Then there are risks of the CCP out right invalidating your shell company shares if CCP considers your shares as foreign ownership. This depends on how the shell company shares are related to the Chinese company. Most of the shell companies are shown as a subsidiary of the Chinese company. So the CCP can consider owning shares of a shell company of a Chinese company subsidiary as foreign ownership and invalidate those shares. The below Bloomberg link has more about this as well. 

And then there are accounting issues. The standards of listed Chinese and American company accounting requirements are different. We already have an example for this - luckin coffee.

mdn3nz,stocks,"Tech is tanking at the moment, but it will come back up eventually. Don’t listen to the big media platforms too much!","So lately the market has been going down and people might have gotten some bloody days in their portfolios. The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.

The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. 

This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...

This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.

Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. 

You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.

rqf6mk,stocks,The SEC Is Going Too Easy on Insider Trading - Investors need to know more about executives’ stock-selling plans.,"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-28/the-sec-is-going-too-easy-on-insider-trading

At long last, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sketched out a plan to address a difficult issue in the U.S. stock market: how and when corporate insiders, who inevitably have better information than the investing public, can legally trade in the shares of their companies.

The proposal is good, as far as it goes. But it could do a lot more to assure regular investors that insiders aren’t taking advantage of them.

Under current rules, executives and directors can largely avoid charges of illegal insider trading by setting up a predetermined schedule of sales or purchases, known as a 10b5-1 plan. Yet if they know that their company is about to do a big deal or report some bad news, there are still plenty of ways they can use such plans to act on the information. They can set one up for a single trade and act on it the next business day. They can set up multiple plans, then cancel the disadvantageous ones at any moment. It’s hard for the public to understand what’s going on, because many of the relevant details of the plans typically aren’t disclosed or are hard to find.

Now the SEC is moving to make the plans harder to game. Its proposed new rule would establish a 120-day cooling-off period before a first trade can be executed — long enough to erase any informational advantage the insider might have when a plan is created. It would limit single-trade plans to one per year, and effectively disallow executives to have multiple plans simultaneously. All these are positive changes. But in other areas, particularly public disclosure, the SEC’s proposal falls short.

Right now, when an executive creates or terminates a 10b5-1 plan, it’s up to the company to decide whether or not to disclose the move. For example, as far back as 2004, Cisco Systems would regularly file 8-K disclosures about such plans, including the executive’s name, the number of shares and the timeframe for the sales. But starting in 2018, the company stopped providing that level of detail, with no explanation. Absent any formal rules, the company and its lawyers could pick and choose what they wanted to reveal.

The new proposal would require companies to disclose the plans in their quarterly 10-Q financial reports, with some added information (on stock options, for example) in their annual 10-K reports. That’s not good enough. To be truly useful to investors, the disclosure should happen as soon as the plans are created or canceled – for example, under 8-K rules that require filing within four business days, as the SEC’s own investor advisory committee recommended.

Why would the SEC go against investors’ recommendations? Most likely, to satisfy the two Republicans among the agency’s five commissioners – one of whom, Elad Roisman, publicly stated that “this wasn’t the rule I would have written.” The proposal ultimately garnered unanimous support, a rarity in these times of political divisiveness. But even the modest disclosures it requires could yet be watered down or eliminated when corporate law firms start chiming in.

Recent history isn’t encouraging. The SEC was actually more ambitious in 2002, when it proposed that 10b5-1 plans be subject to 8-K disclosure. But various commenters, including large brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, complained that the requirement would “confuse investors.” Others objected to the added paperwork. The idea was dropped.

As an avid reader of SEC filings, I’ve long argued that more and better disclosure benefits all investors, even if it means a bit more work for the folks that prepare these documents. The latest proposals, assuming they survive corporate lobbying, are a step in the right direction. But they still won’t provide nearly enough information in a way that matters for ordinary investors.",2021-12-28 12:51:12,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406369,792 days 09:19:13.406369,273,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rqf6mk/the_sec_is_going_too_easy_on_insider_trading/
rjzlr9,stocks,Manchin Says ‘No’ on Biden’s Build Back Better Plan,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/manchin-says-no-on-bidens-build-back-better-plan-51639927129

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., WVa.), said the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better social spending and climate change bill is a “no” as far as he is concerned.

The centrist Democrat told Fox News Sunday he “cannot vote to continue with this peice of legislation.” The bill, which Senate Democrats had hoped to pass by Christmas, stalled last week after prolonged negotiations between Manchin and President Joe Biden.

“I’ve tried everything humanly possible,” Manchin said Sunday. “I can’t get there.”

The comments were certain to provoke a backlash by progressive members of the party, who wanted to bundle the social spending plan with the already enacted plan to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure to ensure its passage.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) told CNN on Sunday he would push to bring Build Back Better to a vote in the Senate, to force Manchin to explain to the public why he opposed it. “If he doesn’t have the courage to do the right thing for the working familiies of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world,” Sanders told CNN.

The bill, which the House already passed, includes spending on childcare, early education, and child tax credits. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices, expand Medicare and push for investments in clean energy, among other initiatives.

Last week, Biden conceded the Senate would likely push consideration for the bill into the new year after trying to convince Manchin to support it. Manchin has balked at the dollar amount of the spending and some provisions such as paid family leave, saying the spending would add to the deficit at a time when consumers are already paying higher prices for food, fuel and other household needs.

“This is a no on this legislation,” Manchin said.",2021-12-19 16:00:34,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406376,801 days 06:09:51.406377,1447,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rjzlr9/manchin_says_no_on_bidens_build_back_better_plan/
lsyfcs,stocks,What caused stocks to dump yesterday: the unwinding of $50B worth of bonds,"Last week and earlier this week, I've been posting warnings about watching out for increased volatility leading into March, and particularly toward the end of March, which is the end of Q1. We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as ""rotation"" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. 

Monday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to ""unwind"" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. 

We can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called ""whales"" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. 

Yesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*

[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)

* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  

> “It wasn’t an orderly selloff and certainly didn’t appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,” wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. 

* **""Fundamental decoupling"" between low interest rates and a heating economy**

Bond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of ""maximum employment"" plans

> The bond market’s divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve. Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off Libor -- collapsed in record volumes as traders repriced their expectations for the path of Fed rates with few obvious catalysts.

* **What exactly happened?  5-year Treasury notes jumped 22 points, and spreads associated with those notes jumped 24 points**

> The main protagonist in the bond market was the five-year Treasury note, a maturity often associated with long-term Fed rate expectations, where yields closed 22 basis point higher on the day. The so-called butterfly-spread index -- a measure of how the note is performing against its two- and 10-year peers -- jumped 24 basis points, the worst daily performance for the sector since 2002.

> Markets now see a Fed hike by March 2023 compared to mid-2023 previously, and have priced in rates over 50 basis points higher by 2024.

> But in remarks this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered reassurance that policy would continue to be supportive and look beyond a temporary pick-up in inflation, especially from a low base. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida expressed cautious optimism on the outlook, he said it would “take some time” to restore the economy to pre-pandemic levels.

* **Bond buyers who disagree with the Fed were ""on strike"" yesterday and created a ""liquidity drought""** 

> A number of more “technical-style” factors were in the mix, against a backdrop of a good-old-fashioned buyers strike...

> A lack of bond market liquidity, just when traders needed it most [i.e. during a big dump of $50B in bonds]

* **Also high frequency trading exists in the bond market too, apparently, and they suddenly disappeared yesterday in a market that was used to their presence, at the same time buyers thinned out**

> “We think that a steep decline in market depth contributed to the outsized moves in yields today,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Jay Barry in a note to clients. Barry showed how the share of high-frequency traders in the Treasury market -- which has been on an increasing trend -- tends to retreat rapidly as volatility spikes.

I expect to see more volatility as positions from 2020 unwind and people create whole new portfolios for post-pandemic 2021. This is a good time to look at which stocks are the ones doing well each day and why.

Edit: I plan to reenter tech stocks hardcore once these whales are done with whatever BS they do at the end of every quarter whenever there are big changes.

Edit 2: Here's an addition of more material offered by /u/TomatoeHaven from other references (I have not checked them)

**What impact, if any, does the Fed have on Treasury Yield?**

Note: Treasury yield briefly topped the 1.6% level on Thursday and traded at its highest level in more than a year, raising concern for investors across asset classes.

“To be sure, if bond yields continue to rise and there is a smooth rotation out of growth and defensive stocks into value and cyclical stocks, the Fed will remain sanguine,” strategist Albert Edwards of Societe Generale said in a note. “But the risk is growing that with so many bubbles blown by the Fed something will burst soon.”

mz87ma,stocks,GameStop Completes At-The-Market Equity Offering Program,">GameStop disclosed on April 5, 2021 that it had filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer and sell up to a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000. Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStop’s transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Company’s balance sheet.

This is amazing news. GME sold 3.5 mil shares at ~$157 to raise 550 mil. The company has zero debt and now has signicant money to fund their transformation moving forward. Stock is currently up 12% in AH, reaching $190. GME is now primed for another run and the highly anticipated short squeeze is that much closer to reality.

16as3pc,stocks,Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. The bet hasn’t paid off.,"Spotify’s $1 Billion Podcast Bet Turns Into a Serial Drama

The prospect of podcast riches led to aggressive investments in celebrity deals and original programming for what appeared a sky’s-the-limit media frontier  
Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.  
The bet hasn’t paid off.   
Most of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.   
No one in the business is making much money on podcasts, but Spotify, which has spent far more on the medium than its rivals, has more to lose than most. Spotify’s competitors, including Amazon, Apple and Google, tech behemoths with their own audiostreaming services, have other, more profitable businesses.

Shares of the video game company soared more than 50% to $101.01 at its high of the session shortly after the open. The stock was last up 35% to $87.80 when it was halted for volatility.

“The sudden, sharp surge in GameStop’s share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze, given the high short interest, and, to a lesser degree, speculation by retail investors on forecasts for the new gaming cycle and the involvement of activist RC Ventures,” Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said in the note on Monday.

GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer, has been a popular short target on Wall Street. In fact, more than 138% of its float shares had been borrowed and sold short, the single most shorted name in the U.S. stock market, according to FactSet citing the latest filings.",2021-01-25 14:49:55,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406406,1129 days 07:20:30.406406,545,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4pai1/gamestop_jumps_another_50_to_above_100_at_one/

For the third quarter, total net revenue came in at $365 million, missing estimates of $431.5 million, according to Refinitiv. Revenues increased 35% year-over-year but were well below the second quarter’s revenue of $565 million.

Robinhood said it expects fourth quarter revenue no greater than $325 million. The company sees account growth in line with the 660,000 opened in the third quarter of 2021.

“For the three months ending December 31, 2021, we anticipate that many of the factors that impacted our third quarter results, such as seasonal headwinds and lower retail trading activity, may persist,” the company said in a press release.

Robinhood reported a net loss of $1.32 billion, or $2.06 per share. Wall Street was expecting a loss of $1.37 per share, according to Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear whether those figures were comparable.

nrou4z,stocks,"With wood prices so high, curiosity struck me. Why is wood so expensive and where is all the money going?","Wood is crazy expensive right now. and most seem to believe that the cost is driven by the demand for wood. But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. 

One thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. 

* West Fraser: 130% 

* Canfor 180%

* Weyerhaeuser 80%

* Resolute Forest **500%**

Why is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. 

Looking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.

There are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**West Fraser**

COGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%
Selling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%
Net Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**

*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. 

West Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.

Some interesting things to point out:

* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. 

* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. 

* Although ""Selling, G&A"" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.

* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. 

Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future.

lfuoe9,stocks,BB is not a phone company. Here’s some DD.,"They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. 

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. 

Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. 

Edit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains. You can google search this yourself if you don’t believe so.

lsfk88,stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",2021-02-25 20:06:59,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406457,1098 days 02:03:26.406457,310,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lsfk88/indicators_explained_for_newbies_in_stock_market/

mhvteb,stocks,I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned.,"Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.

I had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.

To celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.

Here's the first one:

**I can't predict the stock market.**

*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.

You can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:

* **Direction:** 65% correct
* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%
* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%

I was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.

Part of the problem was this:

**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**

When J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.

I wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month

[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

J. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

yo2j3k,stocks,Meta Is Preparing to Notify Employees of Large-Scale Layoffs This Week,"Meta [US:META] Platforms Inc. is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be among the largest round in a recent spate of tech job cuts after the industry’s rapid growth during the pandemic.

The layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as Wednesday, according to the people. Meta reported more than 87,000 employees at the end of September. Company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week, the people said.

The planned layoffs would be the first broad headcount reductions to occur in the company’s 18-year history. While smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at Twitter Inc. this past week, which hit about half of that company’s staff, the number of Meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment. 

A spokesman for Meta declined to comment, referring The Wall Street Journal to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company would “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.”

“So that means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,” he said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 26. “In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.”

The Journal reported in September that Meta was planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions.

l47j9y,stocks,"Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis","**PLEASE LEAVE AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market.

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

>**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
>  
>Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

1866nwx,stocks,"Charlie Munger, investing genius and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man, dies at age 99","Billionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett’s right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99.  
  
Munger died Tuesday, according to a press release from Berkshire Hathaway.  
  
In addition to being Berkshire vice chairman, Munger was a real estate attorney, chairman and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp., a member of the Costco board, a philanthropist and an architect.  
  
In early 2023, his fortune was estimated at $2.3 billion — a jaw-dropping amount for many people but vastly smaller than Buffett’s unfathomable fortune, which is estimated at more than $100 billion.  
  
During Berkshire’s 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel “will keep the culture” after the Buffett era.  
  
Munger, who wore thick glasses, had lost his left eye after complications from cataract surgery in 1980.  
  
Munger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett’s Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own.  
  
Buffett credited Munger with broadening his investment strategy from favoring troubled companies at low prices in hopes of getting a profit to focusing on higher-quality but underpriced companies.  
  
An early example of the shift was illustrated in 1972 by Munger’s ability to persuade Buffett to sign off on Berkshire’s purchase of See’s Candies for $25 million even though the California candy maker had annual pretax earnings of only about $4 million. It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire.  
  
“He weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,” Buffett told CNBC in May 2016.  
  
Or as Munger put it at the 1998 Berkshire shareholder meeting: “It’s not that much fun to buy a business where you really hope this sucker liquidates before it goes broke.”  
  
Munger was often the straight man to Buffett’s jovial commentaries. “I have nothing to add,” he would say after one of Buffett’s loquacious responses to questions at Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha, Nebraska. But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. And like one of his heroes, Benjamin Franklin, Munger’s insight didn’t lack humor.  
  
“I have a friend who says the first rule of fishing is to fish where the fish are. The second rule of fishing is to never forget the first rule. We’ve gotten good at fishing where the fish are,” the then-93-year-old Munger told the thousands of people at Berkshire’s 2017 meeting.  
  
He believed in what he called the “lollapalooza effect,” in which a confluence of factors merged to drive investment psychology.

pz8tjh,stocks,Redditors Are Right About the Unfairness of the Market,"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-01/ordinary-investors-don-t-get-a-fair-shot-when-the-powerful-flout-the-rules

A rallying cry of the day traders that hang out in Reddit Inc.’s stock market forums is that only by joining forces can they prosper in an environment inherently hostile to small investors. Recent events suggest their suspicion that the decks are stacked against them is justified – which is a terrible look for capitalism.

Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School, has amassed evidence of widespread insider trading by company executives, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this week. An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that more than 130 U.S. federal judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 court cases involving companies in which they or their families had investments. And at the Federal Reserve, two policymakers have resigned amid a probe into their personal trading activity.  

Wharton professor Taylor’s research has shown that corporate insiders consistently dumped holdings before official legal probes hurt their company’s shares, Businessweek reported. They also increased their buying and selling in the gaps between audit reports being produced for company boards and being made publicly available, and exploited rules governing scheduled trading schedules for profit.

His analysis suggests the existing regulations governing insider trading are inadequate. It also implies that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asleep at the wheel: The watchdog instigated only 33 insider trading cases last year and just 32 in 2019, the fewest in more than two decades, according to Businessweek.

Since 1974, federal law has explicitly prohibited U.S. judges from overseeing cases in which they or their immediate family have a “legal or equitable interest, however small,” the Journal reported earlier this week. But the newspaper found that in two-thirds of the cases in which judiciary members had a stake, the rulings would have benefited their finances.  

At the U.S. central bank, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan both resigned within hours of each other on Monday. Both had revealed questionable investing activity in their annual financial disclosures. And while they said the trades were within the central bank’s rules, both are being scrutinized further. “We’re looking carefully at the trading that was done to make sure that it’s in compliance with our rules and with the law,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.

In light of those embarrassing events in the U.S., you’d hope that every central bank in the world is currently getting busy reviewing the protocols governing what policy makers are allowed to do with their personal portfolios while in office. You’d also hope that every central banker in the world is examining their investment activities and tappity-tapping a resignation letter if their pursuit of personal profit is at odds with the probity of their position.

Capitalism is still tarnished by the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, when the risks taken by private capital had to be bailed out by public funds. And the growing prevalence of the fastest-growing companies staying off public markets and funding their expansion instead with private capital keeps them out of the portfolios of retail buyers, further stoking suspicion that the covenant between capitalism and society is asymmetrical and biased against individual investors.

When corporate executives, judges and policy makers line their own pockets by either bending or breaking rules designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, they do a disservice to society as a whole. “Most Americans today believe the stock market is rigged, and they’re right,” Wharton’s Taylor told Businessweek.

Sure, public officials have the same right to set aside income for their retirement or to pay school fees or even to buy sport cars or boats. But they can achieve those goals by putting their money into blind trusts or index funds or other financial products that don’t involve them selecting specific individual stocks of companies.

We have a lot of work in front of us, and it will take time. We’re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we’re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times. We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that’s not gonna happen. You won’t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That’s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we’ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth. Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words.

16bmqaw,stocks,"The End of Airbnb in New York: Local Law 18 goes into force, potentially wiping out thousands of Airbnbs","THOUSANDS OF AIRBNBS and short-term rentals are about to be wiped off the map in New York City.

Local Law 18, which came into force Tuesday, is so strict it doesn’t just limit how Airbnb operates in the city—it almost bans it entirely for many guests and hosts. From now on, all short-term rental hosts in New York must register with the city, and only those who live in the place they’re renting—and are present when someone is staying—can qualify. And people can only have two guests.

In 2022 alone, short-term rental listings made $85 million in New York.

Airbnb’s attempts to fight back against the new law have, to date, been unsuccessful.

There are currently more than 40,000 Airbnbs in New York, according to Inside Airbnb, which tracks listings on the platform. As of June, 22,434 of those were short-term rentals, defined as places that can be booked for fewer than 30 days.

lqhbv5,stocks,Let's not panic here - This selloff is a healthy market reaction to rising treasury yields,"**Disclaimer:** I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping this post brief.

Folks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath. Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon.

Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday's selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can't see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let's assume it opens 13,350.

That's still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That's also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that's 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.

Now I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That's the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks those volatile positions deep in the red. I know how you all feel.

&#x200B;

Now, what's happening?

**Treasury yields are rising.** That's what's happening. There's obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden's stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. **That's a good thing:** Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It's a good thing.

Why are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden's stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting ""safe"" investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.

Wait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&P is barely phased.

So back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what's happening right now. This doesn't mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn't changing.

&#x200B;

**What should we do?** That's entirely up to you. I'm no financial advisor. I'm no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm no expert. But really, I'm barely doing anything. I'll be taking a page from Cathy's book: keeping a close eye on when this new craze slows down, sell some of my ""safer, less impacted stocks"" to raise cash and buy the ones that were hit hardest.

I am following up on the status of your stock certificates. Below, you will see the response from our research and custody team:

Strategic Materials Corp. went bankrupt in 1969. Their stock is worthless.

Overbook Improvement Company still exists, however their stock is privately held. LPL doesn't accept private stock on non-retirement accounts. The client would be best advised to contact the company directly. We could not find contact points, but their business records are available with the State of Pennsylvania should the client like to chase further.

While Strategic’ s value may be in framing the certificate as a keepsake, Overbrook may have some value. I hope this gives some insight to the next step regarding this.

The company continues to build and sanitize its business, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future.


“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told The New York Times in an interview. “All good companies should go public when they can.”

q6l0p5,stocks,I Interviewed 20 Leading Wealth Management Firms: Here Are All Their Strategies,"I sold a company I created, and after the press release went out, I was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees. At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people’s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.

What I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people’s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients.

I’m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn’t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here’s what I learned:

**Goldman Sachs**

It’s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It’s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds.

The mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies.

Why would they offer a less diverse array of stocks?

They state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they’d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns.

They locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.

Did I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.

For the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more “free” accounting services they include.

**Personal Capital**

This may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs.

They start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year.

They charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.

**Ritholtz Wealth Management**

If you’ve watched CNBC regularly, you’d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He’s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive.

In fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%.

The next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors

**SPY Collars**

This strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here’s how it works.

Let’s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 440, the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 440, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the $40 per call option premium, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You’d lose money on the call, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment.

The option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven’t spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction.

If the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.

If you don’t follow this, don’t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&P 500 index with this strategy and they say this.

So there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It’s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money.

**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**

About 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not.

This strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly.

I could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.

**Tactical Firms**

These firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip.

One thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others.

The best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses.

You can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I’ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I’ve held for years with significant gains.

Their desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020.

Their overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events.

**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms’ average returns and I’ve actually learned a lot in the process. Sharing in case anyone could use the strategies.",2021-10-12 12:25:58,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406672,869 days 09:44:27.406672,442,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q6l0p5/i_interviewed_20_leading_wealth_management_firms/

tjc3ns,stocks,Meta employees are looking to leave jobs as their stock based compensation has plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months,"Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months – and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. “Joined Meta near [all time stock high], now feeling like shit,” one Meta employee said this week in a popular thread on Blind, a corporate message board with verified members. “What should I do?” “Leave this crap place,” another “Metamate” responded, according to the New York Post. “Same boat,” a third said, adding that they’re “already interviewing” at other companies. “Duh, you’re supposed to think Meta, Metamates, and me. Ask yourself if this train of thought is good for the company,” a fourth joked. “Just kidding … it super sucks.”

Meta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $US380 ($A512) in September to $US216.49 ($A292) at the time of writing. The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. “People are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,” Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. “I think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this – if this could be the beginning of the end for them.” When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company’s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company’s stock rockets – but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.

For example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company’s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies – such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year – can theoretically “buy the dip” by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled “Metamate’s” post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: “The only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I’m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.” Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. “If you’re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,” Ms Martin told The Post. “I agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.”

txo96r,stocks,The Fed has more money on its balance sheet (8.9 trillion) then the total value of all 401ks in the United States (7.3 trillion as of 9/21).,"5 trillion of that was added to the Fed’s balance sheet since Feb. 2020: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

401k balances: https://www.ici.org/401k

But oh ya, inflation is only happening because the ships and ports and all that jazz. Definitely not also because of the largest instance of debt monetization in the history of mankind.

This behavior jeopardizes the USD’s status as the reserve currency of the world.


Edit: Not saying that expanding the money supply is the only factor driving inflation. Supply chain issues, as we’ve been experiencing, increases inflation. Supply chain issues + expanding the money supply makes inflation even worse; it exacerbates inflation. I’m also not saying it was a bad thing for the Fed to respond as quickly and vigorously as they did. I do, however, think it was a mistake to add 2 trillion more to their balance sheet from August 2020 until now, amid increasing demand pressures and supply shortages. They kept adding to their balance sheet, expanding the money supply, even as the US made it through the eye of its economic storm.

I also chose 401ks as a reference point to compare against. 9 trillion is hard to conceive of. Thought that a unit of comparison would help. Other comparisons. US GDP = approx. 25 trillion. California GDP = approx. 3.5 trillion. Texas GDP = approx. 2 trillion. NY GDP = approx. 2 trillion. Florida GDP = approx. 1.2 trillion. GDP of UK = 3 trillion. GDP of Germany = 4 trillion.

mlux4z,stocks,"For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.","#DON'T PANIC

(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

mznup5,stocks,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.","**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies. Following is the split of recommendations. 

|Rating |\# of records |% of total |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy|35,158|52.9%|
|Hold|27,033|40.6%|
|Sell|4,041|6.1%|
|Others (Cautious, Speculative etc.)|284|0.4%|

 For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation

b. One month after recommendation

c. One quarter after recommendation

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.

**Results:**

**Performance of Buy Recommendations** 

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.5%|0.3%|\+40.7%|
|One Month|1.7%|1.4%|\+23.2%|
|One Quarter|4.9%|4.0%|\+22.8%|

 Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

**Performance of Sell Recommendations:**

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.3%|0.3%|\-7.3%|
|One Month|1.8%|1.5%|\+17.1%|
|One Quarter|5.4%|4.0%|\+36.0%|

Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative) 

 **Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

you can find the chart [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mznidl/oc_i_analyzed_66000_buy_and_sell_recommendations/)  

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.

**Conclusion:**

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

t2uiat,stocks,BP said on Sunday it plans to abandon its 19.75% stake in oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,"BP said on Sunday it plans to abandon its 19.75% stake in oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, marking an abrupt and costly end to 30 at times fraught years operating in the oil-rich country.

The British oil and gas giant did not say how it planned to exit its stake, which it said would result in charges of up to $25 billion at the end of the first quarter. Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production.

""I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink bp's position with Rosneft,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said.

The move represents the boldest step yet by a Western oil company with exposure to Russia amid an escalating crisis between the West and Moscow.

BP said the move and financial hit will not impact its short and long term financial targets as part of its strategy to shift away from oil and gas to low-carbon fuels and renewables energy.

Looney and his predecessor as CEO Bob Dudley will both step down from the board of Rosneft, which BP acquired a shareholding in as part of its $12.5 billion TNK-BP stake sale in 2013.

British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who on Friday expressed ""concern"" over BP's stake in Rosneft in a call with Looney, said on Twitter that he welcomed the decision.

""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake up call for British businesses with commercial interests in (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's Russia,"" he said.

As a stake, BP received revenue from Rosneft in the form of dividends which totalled around $640 million in 2021, roughly 3% of BP's cash flow from operations.

mg91ws,stocks,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

y79r6v,stocks,"100% probability of U.S. recession in coming year, according to Bloomberg Economics forecast model","The U.S. economy falling into recession within the next 12 months is a virtual certainty, according to the latest Bloomberg Economics forecast model released on Monday.

The dire projection surfaced just weeks before national midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Just a week ago, President Joe Biden said a recession in the U.S. was unlikely and said any such downturn would be “very slight” if it did occur.

Bloomberg Economics’ latest statistical projections showed a 100% probability of a recession within the next 12 months as the U.S. economy contends with decades-high inflation, Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and mounting geopolitical tensions.

The likelihood of a recession was 65% in the Bloomberg model’s most recent previous update. Generated by economists Anna Wong and Eliza Winger, the model utilizes 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to assess the odds of a downturn from one month to two years in the future.

A separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists predicts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months now stands at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier.

The Bloomberg Economics model showed a 25% probability of a recession hitting even sooner — within the next 10 months — up from 0% in the previous release.

Fears of a deep recession have surged in recent months as the Fed hikes interest rates in a bid to cool inflation. Investors believe the Fed risks “overtightening” monetary policy in reaction to higher prices and driving the economy into a sustained downturn.

Segments of the U.S. economy, such as the housing market, have shown signs of struggle.

The Fed has implemented supersized three-quarter-point interest-rate hikes at each of its last three meetings, with a fourth major increase expected when monetary-policy makers hold a two-day meeting Nov. 1–2. Despite the rate hikes, inflation ran at a hotter-than-expected 8.2% in September.

Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others have downplayed concerns about the economic outlook for months.

“I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly,” Biden said during an interview with CNN last week.

“Look, it’s possible” he added. “I don’t anticipate it.”

Yellen has suggested the central bank, which she led in 2014–18, would need both skill and luck to pilot the economy toward something other than a hard landing.

U.S. GDP has declined for two straight quarters — a rule-of-thumb definition of a recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research, a key economy tracker, has yet to formally declare one is underway.

A separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists puts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier

rihm2k,stocks,JPMorgan agrees to $125 million fine for letting employees use WhatsApp to evade regulators reach,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/17/jpmorgan-agrees-to-125-million-fine-for-letting-employees-use-whatsapp-to-evade-regulators.html

JPMorgan Chase is paying a $125 million fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that its Wall Street division allowed employees to use WhatsApp and other platforms to circumvent federal record-keeping laws. The SEC said Friday in a statement that JPMorgan Securities admitted to “widespread” record-keeping failures in recent years. The bank’s employees used personal smartphones and email accounts, as well as messaging services including Meta-owned WhatsApp, to conduct securities business matters from at least January 2018 through November 2020, the regulator said. SEC officials who spoke to reporters Thursday evening said JPMorgan’s failure to preserve those off-line conversations violated federal securities law and left the regulator blind to exchanges between the bank and its clients.

Federal law requires financial firms keep and retain meticulous records of electronic messages between brokers and clients so that regulators can make sure those firms aren’t skirting anti-fraud or antitrust laws. Regulators in New York and London have ratcheted up enforcement of record-keeping rules in recent years as traders migrated to encrypted messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. While phone conversations and messages on official company devices and software platforms are preserved, it’s much harder for bank compliance departments to surveil communications on third-party apps. The method picked up in popularity after two of the industry’s biggest trading scandals of the past decade (involving manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets) hinged on incriminating messages preserved in chatrooms, resulting in multi-billion dollar fines for banks.

Traders at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other firms have been dismissed or placed on leave for infractions tied to the practice. But the SEC order reveals how pervasive it was. At JPMorgan, the practice of going offline to communicate was firm-wide, and even the managers and senior personnel responsible for compliance used their personal devices to communicate sensitive business matters, the SEC said. The investigation at JPMorgan is ongoing and the SEC has launched similar probes at firms across the financial universe. JPMorgan ordered its traders, bankers and financial advisors to preserve work-related messages on personal devices earlier this year, Bloomberg reported in June.

Officials declined to offer details on the current status of the JPMorgan examination or those at other banks. “As technology changes, it’s even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a press release. In stressing the importance of diligent recordkeeping, Gensler recalled the foreign exchange scandal of 2013, when traders at several of the globe’s largest banks used a private chat room to conspire to fix currency rates to maximize profits. Five of the globe’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, ultimately agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and plead guilty to resolve the investigation. “Books-and-records obligations help the SEC conduct its important examinations and enforcement work,” Gensler added. “They build trust in our system.” While SEC officials said the $125 million penalty is its largest recordkeeping fine to date, the bigger threat to JPMorgan may be reputational. By going after JPMorgan, the world’s biggest Wall Street firm by total revenue, the SEC has put the industry on notice.",2021-12-17 13:37:29,2024-02-28 22:10:25.406759,803 days 08:32:56.406760,368,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rihm2k/jpmorgan_agrees_to_125_million_fine_for_letting/
p1fylf,stocks,AMC says it will accept bitcoin as payment for movie tickets by year-end,"AMC Entertainment mentioned Monday it will begin accepting bitcoin as payment for movie tickets and concessions if bought on-line in any respect of its U.S. theaters. 

CEO Adam Aron mentioned throughout an earnings name Monday that the movie theater chain will have the IT methods in place to take the cryptocurrency as payment by the tip of 2021.

The transfer marks a wedding of two extremely speculative property — bitcoin, identified for its wild volatility, and AMC, which turned a meme inventory star favored by retail merchants on Reddit’s notorious WallStreetBets discussion board.

The value of bitcoin swung drastically in latest weeks, final buying and selling round $46,000 after falling under $30,000 final month. The latest rebound got here amid optimism {that a} cryptocurrency compromise will be included as a part of the bipartisan infrastructure bundle. The Senate finally didn’t advance the deal.

Tesla had introduced plans to allow bitcoin transactions, however it halted automotive purchases with the digital token in mid-Could as a consequence of considerations over how mining contributes to local weather change. CEO Elon Musk has since commented positively on bitcoin, saying he plans to carry the coin long run.

Shares of AMC climbed greater than 4% in prolonged buying and selling on Monday following a better-than-feared earnings report. The corporate posted a narrower-than-expected loss throughout the second quarter, together with income that topped analysts’ estimates.

The inventory has rallied practically 1,500% this 12 months as a band of retail merchants who coordinated trades on social media platforms managed to create a large brief squeeze within the shares.

t1cd2o,stocks,Great news!!! SEC proposes new rule requiring short-sellers to disclose their positions monthly,"Gary Gensler has been circling short-sellers for months, and now the Securities and Exchange Commission chief is looking to make a big move. Under a new rule proposed by the SEC Friday morning, some investors would be required to report their short sale-related activity to the SEC on a monthly basis, allowing the commission to make detailed short-selling data available to the public for the first time.

“Today, the Commission unanimously voted to propose rules and amendments to broaden the scope of short sale-related data available to the investing public and to regulators,” Gensler said in a statement. “If adopted, it would strengthen transparency of an important area of our markets that would benefit from greater visibility and oversight.”

Since taking the reins at SEC, Gensler has made market transparency a key goal, and short-selling has been a major area of discussion, including after the wild short squeeze that took hold in January 2021 on meme stocks like GameStop GME, -5.80% and AMC Entertainment AMC, -3.90%. The fallout from the short squeeze resulted in a Congressional hearing and an SEC investigation. While the probe did not find any actual malfeasance, Gensler has been hinting that he still was monitoring short-sellers. In February, Bloomberg News reported on a sweeping Department of Justice probe of at least 30 short-selling firms and allies.

Retail investors have complained that more shares are being shorted than are available to trade, while keeping alive online discussions claiming market manipulation, potential fraud by short-sellers and the lack of data publicly available around short-seller trading activity. Under current rules, firms are required to report short interest data to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority twice a month. Critics have said the quality and frequency of that data isn’t highly useful. The SEC’s proposed new rule will look to bridge that gap.

While the changes to previously proposed SEC rules have been common, as written Rule 13f-2, would only apply to institutional investment managers that hold “a short position of at least $10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 percent or more of the total shares outstanding” in an individual security, meaning that the SEC would be able to see and share the biggest short sales of individual stocks and aggregate them, providing investors with granular data on those shorts. Firms also would have two weeks into every month to disclose, giving essentially a detailed 6-week lookback at big short moves and give a much clearer, if month-old, picture of short interest on stocks.

The rule, as designed, would increase disclosure of what is known as “buy-to-cover,” essentially when a trader initiates a buy trade to close their short position on borrowed shares, something that short-selling critics likely will welcome as it would aim to further curb so-called “naked shorting,” a practice the SEC mostly outlawed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis for traders using non-existent shares to short stock of public companies. Overall, the new transparency rule is yet another push by Gensler to bring more market data out of the dark corners and into the light.

As he told MarketWatch in an exclusive interview last week, “Finance is ultimately about trust, and the official sector has a role to help instill that trust through a set of rules on disclosure, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.”

x5pdbd,stocks,Bed Bath & Beyond CFO plunges to death at New York's Jenga tower days after company says it would close 150 stores and cut jobs,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc's (BBBY.O) chief financial officer fell to his death from New York's Tribeca skyscraper known as the ""Jenga"" tower on Friday afternoon, police said, just days after the company said it was closing several stores. Gustavo Arnal, 52, joined Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) in 2020. He previously worked as CFO for cosmetics brand Avon in London and had a 20-year stint with Procter & Gamble (PG.N), according to his LinkedIn profile. On Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), police responded to a 911 call and found a 52-year-old man dead near the building who appeared to suffer injuries from a fall. Police identified the man as Gustavo Arnal. The police statement did not provide further details on the circumstances leading to Arnal's death but added that the New York City Medical Examiner's Office will now determine the cause of the fatality.

On Aug. 16, Arnal, sold 55,013 shares in the company, Reuters' calculations showed based on SEC filings. The big-box chain - once considered a so-called ""category killer"" in home and bath goods - has seen its fortunes falter after an attempt to sell more of its own brand, or private-label goods. Last week, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would close 150 stores, cut jobs and overhaul its merchandising strategy in an attempt to turn around its money-losing business.

I'm just pointing out that most of what this sub has is confirmation bias which does have it's place and helps with the emotional circus of the stock market. Just remember it's not any better then ""the goons at CNBC."" I can give you just as many reasons for the S&P to be up 3% tomorrow as I can for it to be down 3% tomorrow. 

NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS! Now more than ever.

That being said, I get a bit annoyed with the ""I told you so and everyone should have known"" responses. It's easy to boast when you are right and in reality you could have just as easily been wrong.

It doesn't seem like a big deal until someone who lost a lot of money feels singled out like they are the only one who didn't see it coming. No this isn't about me but more what I witnessed in 2009. 

If a year from now the S&P is down 20% from where we are today we can justify it. If it is up 20% we can justify it. Doesn't mean we know anything today.

*****
> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.
*****
> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.
*****
> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.
*****
> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.
*****
> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
*****
> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.
*****
> “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.”
*****
> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.
*****
> # Improving forecasts
> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.
*****
> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.
*****
> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.
*****
> ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
*****
> # Key data during the week
> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX.
*****
> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday
*****
> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.
*****
> “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.
*****
> “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said.
*****
> “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.”
*****
> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.
*****
> “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said.
*****
> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.
*****
> “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.”
*****
> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.”

Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.

> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).

> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright

> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**

> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.

> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.

> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.

> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?

> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.

> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.

> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

> # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January

> The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.

> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.

> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.”

> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.

> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.

> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.

> # Tech Leading in New Highs

> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**

> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.

> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead

> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**

> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.

> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?

> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.

> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.

> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.

iv56al,stocks,"Trump to block U.S. downloads of TikTok, WeChat on Sunday","The Commerce Department announced Friday morning that it would ban U.S. business transactions with Chinese-owned social apps WeChat and TikTok on Sunday.

The announcement comes ahead of an expected statement Friday by President Donald Trump on whether or not the government will approve a deal for Oracle to take a minority stake in TikTok and become a “trusted technology partner” for the company in the U.S.

It’s unclear if the Commerce Department’s announcement means there’s no possibility of a deal going through before the Sunday deadline, and it could be an aggressive move from the Trump Administration to push for its original intention for TikTok to be fully owned by a U.S. company.

“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.

Friday’s announcement from the Commerce Department is an enforcement of Trump’s original executive order from August 6 that gave TikTok 45 days to sell its U.S. business to a U.S. company or face a ban in the U.S. WeChat, which is one of the most popular social messaging apps in the world, is owned by the Chinese company Tencent. TikTok’s parent company is the Chinese company ByteDance. Trump’s executive order cited national security concerns over the Chinese government’s access to user data in those apps to justify the potential ban.

The Commerce Department’s statement on Friday said that starting Sept. 20, U.S. companies would be banned from distributing WeChat and TikTok, meaning the two major mobile app stores run by Apple and Google would have to remove the apps from their libraries. The statement also blocks U.S. companies from providing services through WeChat “for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.”

WeChat is a popular marketing and sales tool for U.S. companies primarily in China, but around the world as well. With U.S. social apps like Facebook and Instagram banned in China, WeChat is the primary app people use for social networking and e-commerce. It’s also a popular app used by people in the U.S. to communicate with people in China, since U.S. apps are banned in China.

The Commerce Department’s announcement also lays out a separate time frame specific to TikTok, which take affect on Nov. 12. The rules that start Nov. 12 include provisions that block U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services for TikTok. This could be directed at the deal being negotiated between TikTok and Oracle, which would provide cloud services for TikTok if Trump approves, and could give TikTok and Oracle more time to hammer out a deal that Trump will approve.

Representatives for Tencent, TikTok, WeChat, Apple and Google were not immediately available to comment.

muq20f,stocks,Stock Shorts Collapse as No Hedge Fund Wants ‘Head Ripped Off’,"Wall Street bears battered by the Reddit crowd earlier this year have yet to regain their gumption, even with stocks at records and valuations near two-decade highs. The median short interest in members of the S&P 500 sits at just 1.6% of market value, near a 17-year low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In Europe, a short-covering frenzy has sent bearish bets collapsing like never before in Morgan Stanley data.

At the same time, hedge-fund longs are around the highest relative levels in years at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s prime brokerage. They’re all signs of the bullish mania propelling global equities to fresh records this month, thanks to the economic re-opening and big policy stimulus. The smart money has little appetite to wager against either expensive or deadbeat companies -- especially after being lashed by the day-trader army earlier this year. “There’s just mass euphoria,” said Benn Dunn, president of Alpha Theory Advisors. “No one wants to get their head ripped off by a short anymore.”

Google parent Alphabet announced plans for a 20-for-1 stock split on Tuesday as part of the technology company's quarterly earnings statement.

The move comes a year and a half after Apple said it would split its stock.

Alphabet intends to split the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the stock, according to the earnings statement. The change requires shareholder approval. Each shareholder at the close of business on July 1 will receive, on July 15, 19 additional shares for each share of the same class of stock they own.

Shares of Alphabet stock have become expensive, at over $2,750 each at the time of market close on Tuesday, having doubled since May 2020.

The big-box retailer previously said it would scale back holiday hiring and give more hours to its staff.

The retailer is offering higher pay as many retailers struggle to fill jobs and focus on retaining employees ahead of the peak shopping season.

Target is a good non tech stock to buy during the recent selloff. The company is still heavily invested to the e-commerce and curbside pickup operations. It will be one of the beneficiary of the upcoming holiday season. Target will be able to compete with Amazon and Walmart.

The AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.

Yet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

In an animated GIF showing how Bard works, a user types in the search query ""what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?""

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

One of the responses generated by Bard says: ""JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.""

Yet this is not accurate. The first picture ever taken of a planet outside the solar system - an exoplanet - was captured in 2004 by the Very Large Telescope array in Chile.

q2hh1p,stocks,The entirety of Twitch has reportedly been leaked,"An anonymous hacker claims to have leaked the entirety of Twitch, including its source code and user payout information.

The user posted a 125GB torrent link to 4chan on Wednesday, stating that the leak was intended to “foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space” because “their community is a disgusting toxic cesspool”.

VGC can verify that the files mentioned on 4chan are publicly available to download as described by the anonymous hacker.

One anonymous company source told VGC that the leaked data is legitimate, including the source code for the Amazon-owned streaming platform.

Internally, Twitch is aware of the breach, the source said, and it’s believed that the data was obtained as recently as Monday. We’ve requested comment from Twitch and will update this story when it replies.

 The leaked Twitch data reportedly includes:

* **The entirety of Twitch’s source code with comment history “going back to its early beginnings”**
* **Creator payout reports from 2019**
* [**Mobile**](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/mobile/)**, desktop and console Twitch clients**
* **Proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch**
* **“Every other property that Twitch owns” including IGDB and CurseForge**

* **Twitch internal ‘red teaming’ tools (designed to improve security by having staff pretend to be hackers)**

Some Twitter users have started making their way through the 125GB of information that has leaked, with one claiming that the torrent also includes encrypted passwords, and recommending that users enable two-factor authentication to be safe.

Finally, the leaked documents allegedly show that popular streamers such as Shroud, Nickmercs and DrLupo have earned millions from working with the popular streaming platform.

Fast forward to today. I have been giving my son $5 a week for chores into a custodian trading account.  I luckily I picked a few good stocks and he has a nice little ~$300 Disney Trip fund for toys, swag, etc. I told him I was going to spend his savings on buying RBLX. I explained to him about market cap, shares outstanding, float and he understood 0 of these things... But I also explained that putting $300 into a game vs $300 into a game company were different things and (inner monologue: while probably over priced at the moment) it may grow his Disney Trip fund while he supports the company that has brought him so much pandemic joy. He was totally jazzed about this prospect and investing in general. Also... payback... sort of.


EDIT: A few more details for the surprising amount of negative posters below, especially for a light-hearted story about both of us learning money lessons.

* I am not shilling Roblox stock we collectively own 4 shares.
* Of course any major losses would be covered.  No children's dreams were ruined in the making of any financial lessons... yet.
* He did have to earn back his mistake through increased help around the house.
* I own a lot of DIS in my own accounts. 
* I match his own bday, card, etc contributions 1-1 to his account as an additional incentive to invest.",2021-03-11 04:01:50,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174002,1084 days 18:08:37.174002,650,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2hbcq/how_i_bought_300_of_rblx_to_teach_my_son_a_lesson/

rv92bv,stocks,"Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html

“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”",2022-01-03 18:58:00,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174018,786 days 03:12:27.174018,572,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rv92bv/apple_hits_3_trillion_market_cap_becoming_the/
kagdre,stocks,If you bought DoorDash at $180...,"You're a complete and utter fool.  Let's take a look at the issues:

1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They're a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.

2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn't care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.

3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant's online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.

4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn't provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?

5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth \~$100/share.

This IPO was purely a case of ownership taking advantage of timing to raise as much cash as possible.  I wouldn't be surprised if this thing is trading at $30 a year from now.

Elon Musk revealed that he believes Twitter is currently worth $20 billion, or less than half the $44 billion he purchased it for just five months ago. In a companywide email Friday obtained by the New York Times about employee stock grants, Musk admitted that the company’s value since going private, in his estimation, is roughly $20 billion; in the aftermath of Musk’s acquisition, many advertisers — the social network’s main source of income — fled the service, and as Vox reported earlier this week, haven’t returned. Elsewhere in the email, Musk said that at one point Twitter was four months away from running out of money, which sparked the need for mass layoffs and other cuts. However, an optimistic Chief Twit also told the employees that still remain there that “I see a clear, but difficult, path to a >$250B valuation,” and that he now views Twitter as an “inverse start-up.”

According to the New York Times, Twitter’s $20 billion valuation puts them in similar company to what Snapchat is worth now, even as that app is struggling to retain users thanks to the emergence of TikTok; even with that comparison, Snapchat averages over 100 million more daily users than Twitter.

plrvw1,stocks,Democrats Propose 2% Tax On Stock Buybacks To Offset Their $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan,"The proposal, called the Stock Buyback Accountability Act, would levy a 2% excise tax on the amount corporations spend to buy back their own stock—a common practice that returns funds to shareholders without generally requiring taxes. 

In recent decades, cash-rich companies have used buybacks to reward stockholders and share-incented employees. Apple (ticker: APPL) spent over $400 billion on buybacks in the last 10 years, while Microsoft (MSFT) spent nearly $130 billion. Since 2017, annual spending on buybacks by companies in the S&P 500 index totaled $650 billion each year, on average, according to an Aug. 6 report by J.P. Morgan quant analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. Some 20% to 30% of those buybacks were funded with debt—the rest with corporate cash.

Brown and Wyden said the 2% excise tax would make corporations think twice about allocating capital to buybacks, instead of hiring or capital investment. Spending by the S&P 500 companies on buybacks rose 11% from this year’s March to June quarters, said J.P. Morgan’s Lakos-Bujas. Capital expenditures rose 6%. Spending on dividends slipped 3%.

nu950n,stocks,France fines Google $267 million for abusing ‘dominant position’ in online advertising," France’s competition watchdog has fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry.

The French Competition Authority said Monday Google had unfairly sent business to its own services, and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog said.

The investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said.

Isabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.”

She added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on both advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize ad space on their websites and mobile apps.

“These very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,” said de Silva.

“This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.”

Google announced in a blog on Monday that it will be making a series of changes to its advertising technology.

“We recognize the role that ad tech plays in supporting access to content and information and we’re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms,” wrote Maria Gomri, legal director of Google France.

The investigation comes after U.S.-based News Corp, French newspaper Le Figaro and the Belgian press group Rossel filed a complaint against Google.

Regulators across Europe are clamping down on the major U.S. tech giants amid concerns that they wield too much power on the bloc’s 700 million plus citizens.

Last week, Facebook was hit by two antitrust probes from regulators in the U.K. and Europe.

The European Commission has launched probes into Amazon, Google and Microsoft over the last few years, while the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority has also launched probes into Google and Apple since it became an independent regulator in its own right in January following Britain’s exit from the EU.

vbhtyg,stocks,Reminder: Federal Reserve policymakers were actively trading stocks in 2020-2021 before selling in September-October 2021,"Since we here are focused on equity performance and are (mostly) hoping the value of our investments rise, I'd like to remind everyone that the Federal Reserve had multiple members actively trading equities while formulating extremely bullish policies in March 2020-September 2021. 

Kaplan and Rosengren sold their individual stocks in September 2021. Some ETF holdings were also barred later in October 2021. QE taper was announced in late September 2021. From that point forward, equities have fallen roughly 20% on a market-weighted basis.

Coincidences are sometimes just that.

How does someone who can allegedly beat the market by so much in his private hedge fund all of a sudden start preforming terribly once his positions are public? He shouldn’t be on TV giving market predictions let alone starting an “Investors Club” marketed towards “building long term wealth”.

Is the entertainment factor the only thing that gets him airtime on such a reputable outlet like CNBC?

rsnnw4,stocks,Did Robinhood use our accounts in Nov for micro transactions?,"I was reviewing my November Robinhood statement and saw some strange activity - buying, cancel buys (BCXL) and selling small amounts of GME and BB, landing me a whopping $0.27 profit. This definitely wasn't me and I don't even have BB in my portfolio at all. I have a very boring portfolio with standard stocks, no fancy options ever. This is the only month this has ever happened.

I figured it was some strange fraud attempt and did all the usual security stuff, but then noticed two even weirder things. 1) There is NO other indication that this activity ever happened. No notifications, no emails, nothing in my ""history"" and 2) my partner had the same weird micro transactions on his account in November, too.  

Uhhh, what? Can other people check if there was random activity recently in their accounts that ONLY showed up on their statement? What is this?

EDIT: Waiting for confirmation from RH, but I’m pretty sure me and my partner’s issue was a trade correction from trades I made earlier in the year. I don’t hold the stock anymore but I did in the past and so did he. I suspect this is the case for most folks who had a similar issue, though some say they NEVER held the stock so… good luck with that. 

All that said, it’s incredible that RH wouldn’t inform users that they would be doing this, because as a lot of other commenters thought, it looks a lot like fraudulent trading!

California will soon give tip protections to delivery workers and require more transparency from DoorDash Inc. and other food-delivery apps under a bill signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday night.
AB 286 requires delivery apps like DoorDash DASH, 1.93%, Uber Eats UBER, 2.98% and Grubhub GRUB, -0.91% to give delivery workers all their tips. The bill also prohibits food-delivery apps from charging customers more than restaurants do. And it addresses hidden fees by requiring the companies to disclose to restaurants and customers a detailed cost breakdown of each transaction.

“Gig companies have profited during the pandemic by keeping consumers and restaurants in the dark about the true cost of their services,” said state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who wrote the bill, in a statement. “Now, small restaurants and their customers will know what they’re being charged upfront and get to see exactly how much is actually benefiting the restaurant.”

The bill, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2022, is the latest of many efforts to regulate the burgeoning app-based food-delivery industry. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year, municipalities adopted emergency delivery-fee caps. This year, San Francisco and New York City enacted permanent fee caps, sparking lawsuits from DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub. And New York City last month passed first-in-the-nation legislation that would establish minimum pay for delivery workers, give them access to restaurant bathrooms and more.

DoorDash, which has faced questions about how much its drivers keep in tips and last year settled a lawsuit by Washington, D.C., accusing it of applying tips to workers’ base pay, says on its website that its delivery workers keep all their tips. Uber Eats and Grubhub also say tips go straight to the drivers.

DoorDash said it had no comment on the signing of AB 286. Grubhub and Uber have not returned requests for comment.

Meanwhile, Newsom vetoed another bill, AB 1444, which would have dictated that agreements between restaurants and food delivery platforms be written and include certain content. It also would have restricted delivery platforms from charging restaurants for forwarded calls unless those calls resulted in an order, and required listing websites to disclose whether ordering through them would result in forwarding a call and a fee paid to a third party other than the restaurant.

In his veto message, Newsom said “We have significantly increased oversight of food delivery companies in recent years.” The governor also mentioned that the delivery platforms have said they no longer charge restaurants simply for forwarding calls.",2021-10-06 15:45:25,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174146,875 days 06:25:02.174146,266,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2n4tm/doordash_uber_eats_grubhub_must_disclose_hidden/

kehrkg,stocks,My 8 investing guidelines.,"I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.",2020-12-16 20:56:16,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174179,1169 days 01:14:11.174179,309,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kehrkg/my_8_investing_guidelines/
iqebna,stocks,"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says","Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

nbmq5e,stocks,Just sold everything and went index fund...,"I just sold all my tech/meme stocks and just went straight to index funds. Over the past few months of ""investing"" I realized volatility is not my friend. Maybe that is the wrong approach but I figured, I'll take the loss as a tax credit and just keep everything in VTI/SCHG and some dividend stocks.

Edit: thanks for the support

An example I’ll use is PLTR.
On March 8th it was at 22$. Analysts were saying buy buy buy. Great. So as of today, it is down 20% from March 8th. Vs VTI, March 8th it was 200, closed at 211 today so you’d be up 6%. Of course, you can wait 5 more years, and maybe PLTR will get to 40-45 again... that is if they don’t have competition, no issues with their business model... whole VTI may go up 30-35% but with less stress of worrying about an individual company... yes less risk, less reward...

Edit:
There have been some messages about ""paper hands"" etc, buy high sell low... valid points perhaps, but, 
I did this for my own self, as I realized that:
 1. I am not a person who can handle the volatility of some of these stocks, I am sure that they will go up in 1,2,3, years etc, but if they do, so will VTI / VOO / SPY.... maybe not to the same level but the road will be less bumpy
 2. This is a way to build a base of my portfolio. I will go back to stocks, but to at a much lower exposure. I do think that inflation will be an issue over the next few years and I think some of the tech stocks will be up / down for the next bit. Especially those companies that are trading at 100x their earnings, so I am sure I will have the opportunity to re-enter (again my opinion). 

In the meantime, I sold, yes I took a loss, but this will be used against any gains I did make this year my offset my taxes a bit (not sure how much, will see in Jan).",2021-05-13 17:52:02,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174197,1021 days 04:18:25.174197,1323,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbmq5e/just_sold_everything_and_went_index_fund/
t009dd,stocks,Putin says Russia will launch a military action in eastern Ukraine!! Dow futures tank 500 points on news,"The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting Wednesday night as Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an early morning address local time, said he would launch a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Earlier, European and U.S. officials scrambled to penalize Russia on Wednesday, responding to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine with a cascade of economic sanctions.

As concerns grew that Russian aggression would escalate, Ukraine warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and to leave the country immediately if they are already there. The move came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Moscow is “always open” to diplomacy, days after ordering troops into eastern Ukraine and recognizing the independence of two self-declared republics in the region.

The European Union was set to hold an emergency emergency meeting on Thursday, and was reportedly considering another round of sanctions on Russian individuals. Officials from the United Kingdom and United States also announced or threatened more retaliatory measures after they unveiled initial tranches this week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a public address that aired early Thursday morning in Moscow that he had authorized a military operation in Ukraine.

The announcement was broadcast shortly after 5:30 a.m. local time, precisely at the same time as the United Nations Security Council was meeting in New York, and member state representatives were openly pleading with Putin not to attack.",2022-02-24 03:14:30,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174203,734 days 18:55:57.174203,909,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/t009dd/putin_says_russia_will_launch_a_military_action/

vxi1zm,stocks,Was the TWTR bid by Elon just a way to hide a massive sale of TSLA Stock?,"Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a ""massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses"" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.

I'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).

I'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).

Global stocks have gained $1.5tn this week and hit fresh ATH. Global stocks now worth $111tn, highest value in history. Last week's gains sound rather bullish from a technical perspective. US and International stocks perform well (with the exception of China) while both growth and value sectors led gains. US small caps lagged, however.

Current capitalisations:

* Paris - $2.823trn
* London - $2.821trn

Before the Brexit vote in 2016, the capitalisation gap was $1.5trn in favour of London.

Pretty stunning capitulation of the London stock market. Some of this gap closing has been due to currency fluctuations, but that can still be largely attributed to the Brexit vote.

kz682f,stocks,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

[GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 4 (Micro Update)](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lm92zw/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4_micro/)

Before I get started I want to apologize, this will be a smaller less detailed version than I had hoped and I will not be releasing a video as I feel extremely under the weather. However, I have received a large volume of messages regarding part 4 and my analysis, so here it is.

First, let's address something that I find very misleading: ""this happened on absolutely no news""

Well, that simply isn't true. I will mention some key things that led up to this point and would like to also quickly mention the 3-day rule. If ER is bad, you follow the 3 day rule meaning you give it 3 days to bleed before it begins to recover. This is the same for the news cycle. Even the first squeeze when Cohen was announced to be joining the board, it took several days before the market react.

Ok, so let's talk news. 

1. We have passed the first potential catalyst which was the first GME hearing [which unfortunately, was filled with useless information](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/lnkmrn/gamestop_gme_short_squeeze_congressional_hearing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
2. Another catalyst I mentioned was today, the short interest report that was post Jan. 28th spike. [Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) is reporting 60% and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) is reporting 24%. Again, the discrepancy between the two is simply based on a calculation difference using a different float. One is including synthetic longs while the other is not. This is the first mention I could find regarding the [XRT discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/) and how shorts may have actually essentially moved their positions into an ETF that includes GameStop. At this point, there are so many moving parts and distrust, I'm having trouble assessing what the true short interest might be. Regardless, even if we use the 24% figure and respect that to be true, [this is still considered very high.](https://www.powercycletrading.com/what-is-a-high-short-interest-ratio/#:~:text=Regardless%2C%20most%20options%20traders%20would,above%2020%25%20is%20extremely%20high)
3. Following [iborrowdesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) we can also see a significant amount of new short positions opening over the past several days, probably an attempt to short the stock but without it being reported in todays numbers.
4. Chamath also expressed anger regarding how the Congressional hearing went and followed it up with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1363571801289154560). I personally believe Chamath was one of the several large buy orders today.
5. Ryan Cohen also [tweeted one of his infamous emoji tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289). Now, I'm not going to bother to attempt to decipher it, but when he Tweets, GME spikes much like when Elon tweets about Doge, it spikes. 
6. The [GameStop CFO ""resigns""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/23/tech/gamestop-cfo-resigns/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20After,his%20roles%20on%20March%2026) which later news indicates he didn't really willingly resign. This is extremely bullish as GameStop continues to make changes. If the company was losing money for years and the man in charge of money was just fired, this is a *good* thing.
7. [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/)

**Ok, now let's discuss some of these things**

1. The GameStop hearing was simply a joke. The next hearing will paint a more clear picture regarding data as the SEC, FINRA, and potentially, the DTCC will be present.
2. Let's talk short interest. As I have mentioned in previous parts, I have no doubt that original shorts have covered and new shorts have entered. A clear battle I have had in the comments is a lot of individuals seem to believe that shorts only re-opened their positions at the top and that's it. I couldn't disagree with this more. The narrative of GME being a dying brick and mortar company is alive and well, and shorts will continue opening positions all the way down. We saw many new positions open today when it was around $50. There are shorts everywhere, and they completely doubt this company and everyones willingness to hold and continue purchasing more, both for retailers and institutions. 
3. Chamath, Cohen, and DFV was a much needed intervention which brought back excitement and truthfully, they probably purchased more shares themselves. 

**Sorry had to take a bathroom break, like I said I'm feeling very unwell and apologize that this isn't quite as good as my other posts.**

**Let's talk about what happened today**

I believe today was a gamma squeeze with shorts in the worst positions having to cover. I concur with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/) regarding the gamma squeeze and how it started the domino effect. 

I predicted that a large sum of shorts were sitting just over $200 and the AH action helps bolster that claim. We saw the price touch $200 for a moment and then get swatted down like it was a gnat. They absolutely do not want it to break the $200 mark.

**But onto the important part, my predictions as to what comes next**

Now, I'm about to say something very silly but the reason is I want you to make your own decision on what the most likely outcome is.

Tomorrow, either the price will come plummeting down, or it will rise to new, extraordinary heights.

1. Reason for it to shoot down: There are a lot of bagholders, a lot of individuals who are simply trying to escape with at least their money back. Depending on pre-market, we could expect a large sell off at open as people reclaim their losses. This sell-off will induce a panic sell that causes everyone to exit in an attempt to mitigate as many losses as possible.
2. Reason for it to shoot up: There are a lot of bagholders...who won't be satisfied by just breaking even and will refuse to exit until it breaks $1000-$2000. Depending on pre-market there will also be a lot of people who missed the first run have less doubt in their mind for a potential second run. FOMO and sheer buying power will continue to drive the price upward.

Both of these are considering retail investors only, although the ATH price action compared to volume suggests there are significant amounts of institutional and ""large whale"" buyers getting in on the action. They both are also dependent on pre-market so let's talk about that for a moment.

**Pre-Market**

While institutional buyers don't necessarily need retail for this to work, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have reinforcements, so I think they won't begin a bull run until the market opens and retail investors have a final chance to double down while new investors have a chance to purchase their tickets. 

However, if they seemingly don't care and want to buy as soon as able then we will test that $200 resistance. If that is broken...this is going to be absolutely wild. The domino effect will continue upward chasing the shorts who entered at the very top. It would be wise for these shorts to cover prior to it reaching them as they could still take profits and walk away with a significant sum of money. This will propel the price extremely high at which point nearly all shorts would have exited. 

**During Trading Hours**

Again, completely dependent on pre-market, but I still expect a decent sell-off in the beginning of the day as bagholders escape with breaking even happily. If we open above the $200 mark and the selloff does not appear to be driving us below, I expect the shorts who entered their to cover and this reaches parabolic heights.

**Price Targets**

Well, I first want to talk about the infinite squeeze notion. I agree with the sentiment but not for the same reasons most users post about. Here's the thing, everyone still considers GME to be a dying brick and mortar retailer aside from few longs such as myself. That narrative is slowly changing as more and more individuals start to see the significant changes being made within the company. So long as this mentality lives on...so does repetition.

I expect this squeeze to conclude sometime this week, perhaps even tomorrow. What's unique here is we have all now lived through the first one and we will make decisions accordingly, IE taking profits or covering earlier. 

But on the way back down....shorts will open new positions....again. 

A new catalyst will arrive....again.

And we will squeeze...again.

I'm not sure how many times this will happen, but I think after 3/25 ER when Cohen globally explains the changes being made and the plans for the company, the narrative will begin to change on GME's business. Until the narrative changes, I expect shorts to continue re-entering at dangerous positions. $50 sounds like a fantastic place to short if you believe this is a dead company, but the market sentiment is changing rapidly on the potential of this company. Once shorts are only entering at ridiculously high numbers, then we will finally see the end of the GME saga. 

I think a second squeeze will be evidence enough to shorts to not enter at such low numbers, however, greed and doubt goes a long way. So it's very possible this is the final squeeze, but I'm not holding my breath. I will address how I plan on playing this in the next section, but first, some price targets.

So long as we break the $200 resistance, we will have many short positions above that level that will close to avoid getting caught in the red as well as gamma squeeze mechanics at play. That being said, I could see $500 being possible as early as tomorrow. Now the top is so difficult to predict because one of the largest factors is the most unpredictable; the people. Many people were burned by GME and many others have serious FOMO. If there is large volume, then that will be my indicator that people are piling in all over again. If this is the case, I see $1-$2k being possible. If bagholders simply want to exit and take their money back then I think $500 might be the dream peak. 

**So whats your play Hooman?**

Well, as I have said before I am long on GME. So I will be trimming on the way up and leaving some just in case it continues to parabolic heights. I will then re-enter when I believe we hit the bottom which I feel confident starting to re-enter at $70 adding more on the way down. I will then hold tight for another potential squeeze and repeat this process until finally, the GameStop narrative has changed and I could leave my shares along for several years. 

**Again, I do apologize** 

I know this isn't quite as good as my previous posts, but I wanted to update everyone who was asking me to provide them with my analysis. Part 5 will be coming regardless of what happens tomorrow as I stated numerous times, I don't think this story is anywhere near over, not until April do I think we will start seeing it slow down. 

**TL;DR:** Today was most likely a gamma squeeze coupled with some shorts covering. There were significant catalysts and whales to propel this thing. I don't think the GameStop story is anywhere near over. I'm sick sorry this was choppy writing compared to other posts.

w3lo3s,stocks,Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers,"* Surging inflation and interest rates are hammering American consumers and weighing on the housing market.

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

msuo56,stocks,Google uses ‘double-Irish’ to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland,"[https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519)

&#x200B;

  

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",2021-04-17 17:10:22,2024-02-28 22:10:27.174262,1047 days 05:00:05.174262,579,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/msuo56/google_uses_doubleirish_to_shift_754bn_in_profits/

mmsnc1,stocks,"Lumber DD: CNBC and Motley Fool's ""Best Lumber Stocks"" Unsurprisingly Are the Worst Price Performers or Are Unrelated to Lumber","I had to do this cathartic post because it is hilarious how wrong/clueless the mainstream financial analysts continue to be when discussing how investors could benefit as investors from the historic surge in lumber prices.

**Context for anyone living under a rock the last 6 months**

Lumber has been surging to all-time high prices recently, with every indication that it will continue to climb for the next few months due to how massive the new home construction demand and the busy season just getting started.  The price of dimensional lumber will likely dip at some point but will still stay at 2-3x its normal price into 2022 because of how insane the new housing construction boom.  

For those that have suggested otherwise in recent reddit posts, you’re wrong and this post isn’t about that debate.  Go look at the 2021 and 2022 projections for all of the big home builders (KB, TOL, LEN, DHI, etc…).  Every single one is projected to have record earnings the next two years from increased home construction even with the surge in lumber prices.

**The Financial Click-Bait “Best Lumber Stocks”**

If you’re new to lumber and google lumber stocks to maybe see what options are out there to look into, you no doubt have run into the same laughably annoying phenomenon that I did: the mainstream financial media/internet clickbait sites (like CNBC and Motley Fool) keep on producing the same regurgitated articles titled the “Best ___ Lumber Stocks” or “Best Ways to Play the Lumber Surge” which then offer the same regurgitated hot stock tips: 

1) they recommend stocks that produce exclusively **timber** (like RYN) which get NO BENEFITS from the surge in **lumber** prices *because timber (the logs which lumber is made from) aren’t the commodity whose price is surging 3-fold*; 

2) they recommend stocks that get a large portion of their revenue/enterprise value from things other than lumber (or have such a large stock float) so that the benefits of the lumber surge will be pretty diffuse and not have a proportional impact on their stock price (e.g. WY, a clickbait favorite); or 

3) they pitch stocks like LL, Home Depot and Lowes who have done well riding the home improvement wave, but don’t actually produce their dimensional lumber at all and thus have absolutely nothing to gain from the surge in dimensional lumber prices.

For those who want to invest in this lumber super cycle, it probably would be a good idea to invest in companies *whose earnings are actually tied to the price of lumber.*  Companies like WFG, CFPZF, IFSPF and RFP (This list is not exhaustive; these are just examples).  Companies like these that largely base almost all of their income on dimensional lumber, along with wood pulp and paper for some.  (Note: wood pulp surging to a new high as well, so these guys coincidentally are enjoying a double whammy this year).  And unlike WY, these lumber players don’t have nearly the volume of outstanding shares, so the surge in lumber prices is going to translate in a proportionally larger EPS growth.

If you look at the stock price histories of these lumber companies and compare it to the historical price of lumber, their prices largely track with the changes in lumber (and to some degree wood pulp pricing).  2013 and 2018 had surges in the price of lumber and these companies’ stock prices correlated with those surges.  Why? Because the price of lumber and wood pulp dictate these companies’ earnings.  If you look at the timber companies, like WY and RYN, their stock prices don’t track well to lumber prices because the price of timber is separate.  In fact, despite the epic lumber surge, some timber producers are still not doing well because there is a big glut of it in some areas of the continent.

**Let’s Look at the Numbers**

In the end, it’s the numbers that matter, so let’s look at the price performance of these stocks YTD, the last 6 months and the last year.  CNBC and Motley pitched RYN, WY, LL, HD, and LOW as the best stocks to play the lumber surge.  Let’s see how they have done the last year during this surge compared to the actual lumber companies:

**Shill Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/ihngsVA), [6 Months]( https://imgur.com/a/2LlbPN7), and [1 Year](https://imgur.com/a/GMgb6Ta)

Other than LL, all of them have been doing ok.  Some decent growth, all decently beating the SP.  But nothing spectacular and certainly nothing showing explosive stock price growth correlating with lumber’s explosive growth. (I’ll address outlier LL later.)

Now look at the **Lumber Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/CnYBrAb), [6 Months](https://imgur.com/a/qjTCQRQ), and [1 year](https://imgur.com/a/PAXODpp) 

I included WY to prove a point on how badly CNBC and Motley’s favorite “Best” pick has done compared to the actual lumber stocks.  If you look at their growth, as a group its substantially larger than WY or RYN, or these home improvement store stocks. 

**Take away from the charts:** 

The lumber stocks as a group have so far *destroyed* the shill stocks and actually show the type of growth you’d expect from a historic commodity surge.  Unsurprisingly, these lumber stocks particularly destroyed WY which is the most shilled stock by the financial clickbait media, and is probably why WY then seems to be regurgitated in a lot of the recent reddit posts on Canadian lumber stocks.  

For those correctly pointing out that LL is up 500% in the last year, if you caught that party in Q4, good job.  RFP is still beating than LL by over 200%, but still, great job.  That being said, LL’s surge isn’t because of lumber prices and any future growth again won’t be from the surge in price in dimensional lumber.  And you know that because the price of lumber has surged higher in the last three months, but LL is down ~20% in that same time frame.  Frankly, if you bought LL when CNBC told you to in January 2021, you’d be down 20-25%.  The point being that what propelled LL was not the surge in lumber and it’s future is not likely tied to any sustained lumber surge.

**Forward Looking Comments**

For those cynics who keep saying “Lumber cycle is over.  It’s priced in,” you don’t know what you’re talking about and here’s why.  These Canadian lumber stocks are all sitting roughly around their mid 2018 highs when Lumber surged to $600 MBF for 3 weeks in May 2018, and averaged about $550 MBF during the forestry’s Q2, and then crashed Q3/Q4 2018.  

For comparison, in 2021, lumber has been trading at over $1000 MBF since February, and the May futures just topped $1050 this week. [Here’s the CME futures yesterday.](https://imgur.com/a/TRWdKvE)  January 2022 futures are now closing in on $800 MBF.  It seems pretty clear all of these futures are rising and will continue to due so in the near term.  2021 earnings will likely blow 2018’s out of the water.  Yet despite the fact that these futures show these companies are about the have some of the best back-to-back quarters in industry history, they are still sitting at their 2018 highs... doesn’t sound priced in to me.

Case in point, here’s the basic [valuation ratios for the Lumber Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/fiefWln), and here’s the [valuation ratios for the Shill Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/8jd6SsU).  Despite the epic run these lumber stocks have had this last year, they are largely *still* relatively undervalued and have drastically better forward PE’s when compared to the shill stocks or other related industrial sector averages.  

**Conclusion**

I needed to write this cathartic post because I am sick of seeking these financial “professionals” shill the same mediocre/loser stocks as “the best lumber stocks” which have nothing to do with the production of lumber or are literally the worst price performers in the sector.  

I am not telling you what to buy and can’t predict who will do the best this year.  Each of the lumber stocks have their advantage and disadvantages depending on investor preferences. And who knows, maybe these shill stocks are on the cusp of some epic 1000% gains.  But if you want to find a way to benefit from the lumber surge, then it may be wise to invest in *lumber producers* who actually stand to directly gain from the surge in lumber and still have unrealized value to offer if market conditions stay on their current trajectory.  

If you are unsure if a stock you are looking at is timber or lumber, look at financial statements / website.  You will be able to see in a matter of seconds if their earnings come from timber and real estate or wood products/lumber that are actually surging in value.

Note: I am not a financial adviser.  If there is one take away from this post, **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**  Don’t trust strangers on the internet or TV.  Many of them are either lazy morons who keep regurgitating the same brainless clickbait they read somewhere or they have an ulterior motive and are selling you garbage.

      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

mnvvfl,stocks,China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust Case,"The penalty is Beijing’s toughest action to date in its campaign to tighten supervision of the country’s internet Goliaths.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

Edit: This has been super interesting now that it’s gained a lot of traction so I wanted to clarify a few things about my stance on Tesla.

Yes I know Tesla leads the market in self driving, but they may not forever. No single tech company dominates the market for forever, so who knows how long their run might last, could easily go on another decade or two but I sure wont bet on it. I do think they have two huge strengths, however. 1) The ability to keep up with demand better than almost any other automaker and mass produce electric vehicles 2) Brand loyalty, almost like Apple in a sense. With all that being said, their P/E is absurd and I feel like one day the stock may be exposed for what it is. Does that mean I’m willing to short it? Not at all, I’ll just never directly buy any. 

Some of these answers have been amazing, and made me realize I’d buy Tesla way before a few other companies.

sm0vql,stocks,GoPro could be a turnaround company $GPRO (value $15.95 vs price $8.78),"GoPro is down 75% since mid-2014 when it had its IPO. There has been a lot of negative sentiment around it and based on the negative returns to the initial investors, rightfully so.

However, it might be a turnaround company and I'll make my case below.

Up until 2019, the company was mainly selling hardware consisting of cameras and certain accessories around it. Over 90% of their sales were through retail and their gross margin was around 34%.

In the meantime, there have been 2 main changes:

1. In March 2021, they launched an app called Quik and they have 221k paid subscribers ($9,99/year), bringing in around $2.2m in revenue that has a higher margin than their old-school business.

2. They introduced GoPro subscription, which grew to 1.6m subscribers fairly quickly (130k in 2017, 185k in 2018, 334k in 2019, and 761k in 2020). Why is this relevant? The annual subscription costs $49.99 and without knowing anything else, it seems as they're adding $80m in revenue (1.6m x $50). Well, not really. The subscription provides the following:

\- $100 discount on a new GoPro camera - Wait what? A user pays $50 in subscription and gets a $100 discount? That is a no-brainer! But wait, that's not all, it also provides:

\- Unlimited cloud back-up + auto uploads

\- Up to 50% off @ [GoPro.com](https://GoPro.com)

\- No questions asked damage replacement

\- Full access to the Quik app

\- Share on the go

**So, what is the catch?** 

From a user point of view, they get a lot of value and from GoPro's perspective, it doesn't seem to be that profitable as they pay by not only discounting the hardware price but also they have to cover the costs for the rest of what comes with the subscription. In theory, subscriptions are a high-margin segment, but when taking all of this into account, it is clear that we cannot expect the $80m on top of what they're earning. So, why do they offer this?

1. At the beginning, I've mentioned the main sales channel in 2019 was retail, with 90%+ of the total sales. As of 2021, retail was 66%, with 34% being DTC (Direct to consumers). As the subscription is offered through the website, more users are opting for it. This means, they're not paying the ""cut"" to the retail companies and they can increase the gross margins (2021 - 41% gross margin, while 34% back in 2019)

2. As they're providing a high-value no-brainer package, they are more like to retain the customers. When they need to buy a new camera in 4 years, they would not be considering only the hardware, but also what comes with it (Is there unlimited cloud back-up, is there a damage replacement policy, what about the Quik app substitute?). So, the subscription model (in my opinion), is less about making more money and more about retaining the customers by providing value.

&#x200B;

**What about the brand?**

\- The hardware is in a very niche industry (action cameras) and as they're focused on high-quality, they're targeting the high-end. Their Hero10 black was the best-selling camera in the US camcorder market.

\- They have over 46m social media followers across all platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram)

&#x200B;

How does this reflect in the financials?

Their revenue was almost $1.2b back in 2017 and is almost $1.2b now in 2021. So, in the last 5 years, it seems as there were no changes. That's not fully correct as 2020 was terrible due to the pandemic. The customers buy cameras with the purpose to capture memories while they're on holiday. Having that in mind, the drop of revenue to $900m was not unexpected.

&#x200B;

The rest of the operating expenses have also decreased:

\- R&D from 19% of the revenue in 2017 to 12% in 2021

\- Sales & marketing from 20% in 2017 to 13% in 2021 (As they have a huge social media presence, they can use that at a lower cost to interact with their customers)

\- SG&A from 7% in 2017 to 6% in 2021

**Where does that bring the company today?**

The company finally had a positive operating margin of 13.5% in 2021! Their free cash flow is a bit over $100m.

**What about the financial position (balance sheet)?**

The company has half a billion in cash (with a market cap of $1.4b) with debt being below $300m. From a financial health point of view, it is definitely in a good position. In addition, they have around $280m in deferred tax assets (related to valuation allowance) that they can use in the future and pay lower taxes. In my valuation, I'm adding 50% of this as the benefit will come in the future. If we adjust the market cap for the cash, debt, and deferred tax assets, we get to a price of around $1.1b. Not bad for a company with a $100m+ free cash flow.

In addition, in the last earnings release, it was revealed that the management was authorized to buy back shares for $100m.

&#x200B;

**What could be expected in the future?** 

My assumptions for the future are as follows:

\- Revenue growth 6% in the next year (analysts forecast between 4% and 9%) and then 1.83% (risk-free rate) - This leads to revenue growth of modest 25% in 10 years to $1.4b.

\- Operating margin 13.5% in the next year, growing to 14% (long-term operating margin)

\- Reinvestment (sales to capital) ratio of 4 - Pretty high for a manufacturing company, but I do not expect them to invest in an additional factory or any heavy equipment. This reinvestment mainly relates to working capital

\- WACC 7.5%

Plugging all of this into a DCF, the **value per share is $15.95** (price $8.78)

&#x200B;

**What if the revenue doesn't grow as fast and what if the operating margin isn't 14%?**

 Let's take a look at a few scenarios:

&#x200B;

|Revenue/Op. margin|12%|14%|16%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\-10% ($1b)|$11.8|$13.1|$14.4|
|25% ($1.4b)|$14.2|$16.0|$17.7|
|50% ($1.7b)|$15.8|$17.9|$19.9|

uq8vp3,stocks,Friendly reminder: not everyone here is 20-30 years old and can ride the wave. People who are in retirement age should consider going cash.,"Yes, the market will recover: that’s a fact. 

However, it can take a long time to recover. The nasdaq took over a decade to recover in some instances. 

I understand the sentiment of “hold and even buy more when they start to go down” but if you are in your 60s and want to retire soon and can’t wait a decade and see your portfolio get smashed for years I think it’s understandable to go cash

But if you are young, ride this out. 

Just please consider that there’s no all advice fits all here. Some of us are older then others. I’m young but if my dad was considering going mostly cash at his age of 67 I would understand.

I think this is a great sign along with Biden's appointment of Yellen as the Treasury Secretary.  The news brings a sense of stability in that there will be a smooth transition of power and Yellen apparently has a track record of focusing on economic growth as a true economist as opposed to giving into political leanings.

While I am not one to boldly predict how the markets will react the rest of this week and there is still uncertainty given the rise in cases and the lack of stimulus... at least there are fewer variables to worry about.

shpngj,stocks,U.S. lawmakers traded an estimated $355 million of stock last year. These were the biggest buyers and sellers,"Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, buying and selling shares of companies based in the U.S. and around the world. At least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures and MarketWatch reporting. U.S. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.

The trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Stock trading is a bipartisan activity in Washington, widely conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, the disclosures show. Congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the S&P 500 SPX soared and returned 28.4%. Republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall — an estimated $201 million vs. Democrats’ $154 million. 

So who were the biggest traders? The table below, based on a Capitol Trades analysis, shows the 41 members of Congress who made stock buys or sells in 2021 with an estimated value of at least $500,000 — or had family members who made such trades.

At the top of the list of the biggest traders on Capitol Hill by dollar volume is Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, who disclosed an estimated $31 million in stock buys and $35 million in stock sales. He’s followed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California with $34 million in estimated purchases and $19 million in sales, GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee with $26 million in estimated buys and $26 million in sells, and Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state with $15 million in estimated buys and $31 million in sells.

Congress’s more than 500 members are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012’s STOCK Act, though many lawmakers have been late with their filings. The decade-old law, which aims to help prevent politicians from profiting from nonpublic information, is viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups, especially given how a divided Washington united to weaken the law in 2013 by removing provisions such as one that required putting the disclosures in a searchable database. Independent analysis firms have ended up offering such databases, with 2iQ Research, for example, launching Capitol Trades last year. For the table above, Capitol Trades estimated the value of buys and sells using the midpoint of the declared range for the transaction. Lawmakers aren’t required to disclose a transaction’s exact value, but rather give ranges such as $1,001 to $15,000, or $15,001 to $50,000. McCaul’s biggest disclosed trades in 2021 include sales by a child and his spouse of shares in Cullen/Frost Bankers CFR, a bank headquartered in McCaul’s state, as well as sales by his spouse of shares of China’s Tencent Holdings TCEHY, according to filings aggregated by Capitol Trades. The Texas congressman’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. His father-in-law is the founder of media giant Clear Channel, now known as iHeartMedia IHRT, and McCaul has ranked as one of the wealthiest U.S. lawmakers.

Khanna’s biggest trades included purchases by his spouse of shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Microsoft MSFT, along with purchases by a child of shares in Apple AAPL, communications company RingCentral RNG and Facebook parent Meta Platforms FB. The California congressman’s spokeswoman said he “does not own any individual stocks and complies fully with the Ban Conflicted Trading Act, which would prohibit lawmakers from buying or selling individual stocks.” That’s a reference to legislation that has attracted 35 co-sponsors in the House and three in the Senate. “These are his wife’s assets prior to marriage and managed by an outside financial advisor. No trading is done through joint accounts,” Khanna’s spokeswoman also said.

m71xi8,stocks,A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates,"**TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data

**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

&#x200B;

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.

&#x200B;

**In the end the two I landed on were:**

[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms

[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data

&#x200B;

**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
   * Which social media is the most profitable?
   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

&#x200B;

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

&#x200B;

**Other interesting finds:**

Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible

StockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%

**Conclusions:**

Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

&#x200B;

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better.",2021-03-17 14:42:23,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891320,1078 days 07:28:05.891320,447,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/
l0tiop,stocks,Biden will move to implement his $2 trillion climate plan on day 1 to bolster the economy and kick off the new administration's fight against climate change,"Climate change is at the top of President-elect Joe Biden's funding agenda once he assumes office on Wednesday, as the new administration looks to add jobs to the economy while combating the warming climate.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

""If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,"" Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**""Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,"" Yellen said at the hearing. ""And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.""**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in ""full support"" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the ""existential threat"" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.",2021-01-19 21:19:05,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891324,1135 days 00:51:23.891324,580,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/

12s8m77,stocks,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Almost everyone said no I couldn't believe my eyes. They all thought that they could do better than that. If they can do better then they should be working for JP Morgan or some big hedge funds earning millions a year.

lv1sjx,stocks,Investors beware: $ARKK is a liquidity disaster waiting to happen,"I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.

Lately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.

In the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?

We'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

I ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.

***Correlation of 70%***

***R-squared of 0.49*** 

That is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.

What happens next?

Last week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.

The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.

As someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.

After spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.

As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.

Good luck and I hope I am wrong.

***Edit*** - for inquiring minds, the link below is a detailed and succinct overview of some of these concerns from a Fintwit personality.

https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1366028953828270082

***Edit*** - some have pushed back on the analysis and I appreciate the discussion, for additional thoughts on how some of these ETF products (and ETF's in general) can create distortions in the market, there are a few podcasts below that I found pretty worthwhile.

https://www.zer0es.tv/interviews-and-analysis/the-perversion-of-passive-investment/

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-game-ep-3-mike-green/id1508585135?i=1000483139066

***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.

In any case, here goes...

Background on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a ""roll forward"" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.

In this case:

A:   Beginning of period AUM        <--- Sourced from Simfund

B:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   <--- Sourced from Simfund

C:   +/- Market Performance        <--- Implied by D less B less A

D:   End of Period AUM                <--- Sourced from Simfund


In this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.

I think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.

***Edit*** - Criticism of this approach may be that I am using dollar changes in both flows and portfolio returns, rather than periodic percentage changes, however my view is that it is the magnitude of the dollar flows that matters more than percentages when trying to ascertain the impact of illiquidity and investor flows.

***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.

l2d1wp,stocks,Complete PLTR DD ahead of Demo Day (Valuation Included),"# Company Overview

Palantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.

Later they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.

Palantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.

Palantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.

# Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Institutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.

When it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.

A central operating system for data

Palantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.

Augmenting existing data systems, not displacing

At a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.

Making data actionable

Gotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.

Their ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.

Understand the history of data and decisions

Palantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.

Enable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances

The versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.

Users can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.

Enforce rigorous and reliable data protection

Palantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.

AI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions

Their software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.

The AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.

**Revenue Streams**

Palantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.

Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.

It is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.

Gotham

Its main tools include:

Graph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Ava – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.

Mobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.

Foundry

Monocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.

Contour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

Fusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.

Reports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.

I strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.

Palantir’s Software Example Use Cases

* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.
* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.
* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.
* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.
* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.

# Industry

**Market Size**

As of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.

Currently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.

According to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Embrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted

It has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.

We have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.

Buy or Build

Institutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.

Additionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.

Palantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.

Crisis & Instability

A [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

Palantir’s main competitors include:

Internal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.

And two software companies with very similar business models:

[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.

[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.

**Competitive Strategy**

Customer acquisition

Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.

Additionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.

Software engineers on the front line

In order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.

Leverage experience in both private and public sector

To the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.

Palantir’s strategic relationships last for years

By the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.

Palantir has chosen sides

Their software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.

**Growth Strategy**

Become the industry default

Palantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.

This model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.

Continue to grow their direct sales force

Palantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

Increase their reach with existing customers

To drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:

* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers
* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities
* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases

For Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.

Become the default operating system for the U.S. government

Palantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.

Palantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.

New methods of customer acquisition and partnership

As Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.

For example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.

**Moats**

R&D expenditure

Since 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.

Network effects

Every data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.

At a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.

Additionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.

In addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.

Regulation

Section 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.

In 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Privacy and civil liberties

Palantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.

Customer concentration

For the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.

# Financial Summary

**Proforma Balance Sheet**

**Income Statement**

[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)

Palantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.

For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:

* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.
* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).
* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Palantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.

# Investment Decision

**Valuation Results**

[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)

The result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**

Mayor assumptions of the valuation model include:

* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.
* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.
* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.
* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%

Follow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.

**Investment Decision**

I believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:

* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.
* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.
* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.",2021-01-22 01:39:06,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891378,1132 days 20:31:22.891378,392,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l2d1wp/complete_pltr_dd_ahead_of_demo_day_valuation/

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you’ll come across. It’s also known as the profit and loss  (P&L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company’s financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

>*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company’s reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant & equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
>  
>📌 **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

# Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model’s core principle for revenue recognition is to “depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.”
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

>**📌  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

# Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

# Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G & A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

# Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting & tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

# Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

# Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash & marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash & Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary’s revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

# Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

>**📌 SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

# Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/tsbdF73*](https://imgur.com/tsbdF73)

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top – down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn’t  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** – here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company’s consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what’s been  driving an  organization’s financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time—comparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example—instead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

>**E.g –** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 – 1 = 33%.***",2021-05-26 13:42:12,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891399,1008 days 08:28:16.891399,126,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/

Chinese authorities are asking local governments to prepare for the potential downfall of China Evergrande Group, according to officials familiar with the discussions, signaling a reluctance to bail out the debt-saddled property developer while bracing for any economic and social fallout from the company’s travails.

The officials characterized the actions being ordered as “getting ready for the possible storm,” saying that local-level government agencies and state-owned enterprises have been instructed to step in only at the last minute should Evergrande 3333, +17.62% fail to manage its affairs in an orderly fashion.

lbwsxu,stocks,Old fart advice for young investors,"There seems to be a lot of interest in stocks from young investors. I imagine that many will make their way from WSB to this sub because WSB is a bunch of monkeys flinging poo. You may have lost some money and now you want to explore stocks from less of a Meme and emotional perspective. 

There is nothing wrong with Meme stocks. Meme stocks can be fun. I have had fun with it. I am also a 42-year-old man with rental properties, commercial properties, and a few small businesses. BB, NOK, AMC, and even GME are all fine. The DD is fine behind all of them. The issue is that if I lose $1,000 then I can write myself a check from one of my businesses for $10,000 to make myself feel better. That is not a brag...it is simply sharing that people come from different places in life. 

You are just starting off life and probably have far fewer resources and every dollar matters more. 

I challenge anyone to CMV but I am not a big proponent of stocks as a core investment strategy. Here are my reasons why.

1. Information has a time-decay of value. Meaning that information becomes less valuable over time. Data is what is mined to often produce new Information. You are at a disadvantage when it comes to both data and information. The information that you get on a retail level has already lost much of its value. This is where the saying ""if you read it in the news you are already too late""
2. You have no power. You simply cannot compete with whales and whales don't become whales by letting people glean the crumbs that are leftover. They have the power to move markets, you don't.
3. You have no control over outcomes. You have no control over the success of a company. You have no control over other investors. You have no control over anything.
4. The odds on options are not that great. Even compared to blackjack our betting the outside of a roulette table they are just not that good. 
5. Many people that are far more intelligent than you are, lose money at stock investing.
6. Your emotions and FOMO will be a hindrance and problematic. 
7. Most stock investors are too young to understand the market cycles

I like stocks as a small part of an overall investment strategy for young people for the following reasons.

1. Time is valuable and you have the most time
2. Compound interest is the ""force"" behind all investing and compound interest compliments the stock market very well
3. Certain strategies can complement long-term wealth building

Building wealth through stocks is like trying to build a house one brick at a time...just you, and you are gathering the straw, digging the mud, and pressing each brick by hand. When it rains many of your bricks will wash away. If the sun shines for enough days then you will make good progress. 

The problem is that all markets cycle. The housing market cycles. Petroleum and natural gas cycles. The stock market cycles. I believe that a full market cycle is around 18 years with around 7-12 years in an up cycle and 6-11 in a down cycle. In the stock market, they call these bull and bear markets. We are currently in one of the longest bull markets on record due to interest rates and the feds printing money. No one has a crystal ball but sooner or later the market will peak. When this happens Boomers will be the first to pull money out and put it into bonds or CDs. Boomers are as big of a whale as retail can get. Anyone and I mean anyone could have made money in the current market. If ten years ago you had asked a five-year-old to pick five of their favorite things and invested in their choices you would have made money. That could be Barbies, YouTube, Pizza, Sprite, and their Dog. They would have made money on any stocks you picked around those five things. 

There will come a day sooner or later when Boomers and GenX will see trends in the market that they don't like. Boomers own multiple houses and are deep into retirement. GenX is a small but powerful generation that is now on the back Nine Holes of life. Gen X will largely inherit the wealth of the Boomers. There will come a shift towards mitigating losses and that shift is not far away. When they move their money from markets so goes the market.

Is it fair to say that one of the longest bull cycles on record could transition to one of the longest bear cycles?

Let's look at Millenials...a generation that is struggling to just buy a home. Boomers own a few. GenX may own a couple and Millenials that are now entering into their forties struggle with one. Millenials are a massively sized generation that I believe is now bigger than both GenX and Boomers combined because Boomers are dying at a rapid pace. Millenials are the generation that were adults starting life and careers in 2008 and full-blown families with Covid-19. Maybe one of the unluckiest generations. 

GenZ is this very talented and intelligent generation. Y'all are creating disruptions in culture, in politics, and in Wall Street. You are savvy and demanding. Giving billionaires the finger while pissing on the front door of their mansions. 

But you need to be careful.

Stocks are not the key to your success. They are just a single tool in your toolbox. A better tool may be early homeownership or owning a small business. Life is about options...and I am not talking about the gambling options of Wall Street. I am talking about the options of having equity in a home to adapt to economic swings. I am, talking about the options of owning a small business where your day to day decisions make you smarter and more valuable. Where you own assets that make you money. Most importantly you have control over your own destiny.

I am not telling you not to invest in stocks. I am just telling you that it should be a limited part of your overall strategy in life. Unless someone has been through two complete cycles of the stock markets then I would take their advice with a grain of salt. 

General advice:

1. Don't sell stocks that you have taken a loss on
2. Buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying
3. Invest in stocks with a strategy based on your knowledge and experience
4. Invest only what you can afford to lose
5. Stocks work best with time. Leave them alone
6. Be a value investor
7. Invest with a purpose

Number seven is important. For example, I like Robotics, AI, and Automation. I like these is two specific areas....transportation and mining. I operate in the Transportation industry. I know that very soon human drivers will be eliminated and self-driving trucks will take over. Trucks will be loaded, driven, and unloaded without a single human being doing any of that work. With that will come an entire supporting industry. Tow trucks will need to be automatically dispatched when trucks break down or in accidents. AI will need to be involved in decision making. I will see these changes before I am dead and I am 42.

I like underwater mining. Our oceans are the next frontier and the next gold rush. We have areas of sea bottom that has very little life but is rich in gasses, minerals, and thermal energy. Automation, AI, and robotics will play a huge role in underwater mining. I will see this transition start in my lifetime and I am 42.

Beyond that, once we have machines that are capable of underwater mining then we have the basics for machines that can mine inner-system planetary objects. From nearby asteroids to the moon, to thermal energy collection closer to the sun, to Mars and beyond. The wealthiest person in existence will be the person that is able to start the first off-planet mining operation. Where there is no EPA, no taxes on land, where we are not building sub-divisions next to mines. Where we don't have to worry about the ecosystem. Where gasses and pollutants are not pollutants because there is nothing of consequence to pollute. The largest land-owners in existence will be the owner of off-world mining operations. That may not happen in my lifetime...but it may in yours.

I like investing in Meme stocks because they are fun. But I also invest in Robotics, AI, and automation with one-single question....is this company taking humanity one-step close to automated transportation or underwater mining? I invest with a purpose. 

Sure I will grab up some value stocks every now and then. People are going to be flying more than ever in a few years. People are going to be more social than ever in a few years. Shoot Condom manufacturers are a buy right now because people will be..........you get the idea.

The whole reason that I wrote this excessively long post is to maybe get you into thinking about your strategy....what is it? And to caution you on being ""all-in"" on stocks.

The major growth in Amazon's advertising unit means its revenue contribution is now 2.4 times larger than Snap, Twitter, Roku and Pinterest combined, and it's growing 1.7 times as quickly, according to Loop Capital. 

Amazon's ""Other"" unit, which is primarily made up of advertising but also includes sales related to other service offerings, grew revenue a massive 77% year-over-year to more than $6.9 billion in the first quarter, the company reported last month.

This is another bright spot of amazon stock. Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.

okgqbb,stocks,How to find professional stock analysis on the internet.,"Prime brokerages charge $100,000 to $500,000 for full ticker analysis, which is obviously beyond us.

The filetype:pdf is important because if you leave it out you'll get news/wiki/investopedia type sites while the good stuff is on page 1,521.

This will immediately bring you to reports from institutional traders which will mostly be slightly dated by a year or two. Most of the reports won't be comprehensive, instead focusing on categories like valuation, profitability, economic moat, etc. But still, these will be insanely detailed reports which are the same reports that market movers are using.

They’ll be paying you even more for owning their shares because they have such great cash flow. The market opens today, they’re down over 5%. MA, which reports tomorrow morning, is down 6% with it. One could assume they’ll have pretty similar earnings and revenue. Maybe even up their dividend too (don’t hold your breath for that one, but who knows).

rd8qks,stocks,"Inflation surged 6.8%, even more than expected, in November to fastest rate since 1982","The consumer price index was expected to rise 6.7% from a year ago in November, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.

Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 0.5% for the month and 4.9% from a year ago, which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid-1991.

The Dow Jones estimate was for a 6.7% annual gain for headline CPI and 4.9% for core.

With unemployment claims running at their lowest pace since 1969 and gross domestic product expected to show strong gains to end 2021 after a lackluster third quarter, inflation remains the biggest problem for the recovery.

The Federal Reserve is watching the data closely ahead of its two-day meeting next week.

Central bank officials have indicated that will begin slowing the help they’re providing in an effort to tamp down inflation. Investors widely expect the Fed to double the tapering of its asset purchases to $30 billion a month, likely starting in January. That would enable the Fed to start raising interest rates as soon as next spring.

12zeetm,stocks,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal.

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal.

yd0eo8,stocks,"Adidas to End Kanye West Partnership After Controversies; Adidas: was “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry's history""","* **German company may announce it is severing ties on Tuesday**
* **Adidas has been under pressure after antisemitic remarks by Ye** 
* **Adidas would join Gap Inc. and Kering SA’s Balenciaga fashion label in cutting ties with West, who now goes by Ye**
* **Adidas shares, already weighed down by the controversy, fell as much as 3.2% in Frankfurt trading, reaching the lowest since April 2016.**
* **Yeezy line accounted for as much as 8% of Adidas's total sales** 
* **For Adidas, was “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry’s history.”**  

Adidas AG plans to end its partnership with Kanye West following a rash of offensive behavior from the rapper and designer that turned a once-thriving shoe brand into a lightning rod for criticism.

The German sports company may announce the move as early as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. A representative for Adidas didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 

**Adidas would join Gap Inc. and Kering SA’s Balenciaga fashion label in cutting ties with West, who now goes by Ye**. The rapper has made controversial statements, including antisemitic social media posts in recent weeks, and has moved to cut ties with his corporate partners. Ye couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

**Adidas shares, already weighed down by the controversy, fell as much as 3.2% in Frankfurt trading, reaching the lowest since April 2016.**

**The Adidas decision follows weeks of deliberations inside the company, which over the past decade has built the Yeezy line -- together with Ye -- into a brand that’s accounted for as much as 8% of Adidas’s total sales**, according to several estimates from Wall Street analysts. 

The German company is of the view that it owns the intellectual property rights to the products from the collaboration and could continue producing the models, one of the people said.

**Adidas earlier this month called the partnership “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry’s history”** and said it will continue co-managing Yeezy products during its review.

That success, however, has come with plenty of acrimony between the partners. Ye has accused Adidas of copying his ideas and mismanaging the brand, and taunted outgoing Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted on social media. Meanwhile, Adidas has said it’s repeatedly tried and failed to resolve issues with Ye privately.

The rapper said in September he wants to negotiate with Adidas to get a 20% royalty on all the shoes he’s designed with the company in perpetuity.

Ye caused more controversy after that by wearing a shirt at the Paris fashion week that said “White Lives Matter.” He later got locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after making repeated anti-Semitic remarks -- remarks that have created a growing backlash of consumers and celebrities, with some calling for people to boycott Adidas products until the partnership is canceled.

The Ye situation is one of many headaches for Adidas, which is searching for a new CEO to take over in 2023. The company has lowered its earnings forecast several times this year amid falling demand for its shoes and apparel in China and growing signs of economic trouble in Europe and North America.

1aduhbq,stocks,China Evergrande has been ordered to liquidate. The real estate giant owes over $300 billion,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong court ordered China Evergrande, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, to undergo liquidation following a failed effort to restructure $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders that fueled fears about China’s rising debt burden.

“It would be a situation where the court says enough is enough,” Judge Linda Chan said Monday. She said it was appropriate for the court to order Evergrande to wind up its business given a “lack of progress on the part of the company putting forward a viable restructuring proposal” as well as Evergrande’s insolvency.

China Evergrande Group is among dozens of Chinese developers that have collapsed since 2020 under official pressure to rein in surging debt the ruling Communist Party views as a threat to China’s slowing economic growth.

But the crackdown on excess borrowing tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging on the economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China.

Chinese regulators have said the risks of global shockwaves from Evergrande’s failure can be contained. The court documents seen Monday showed Evergrande owes about $25.4 billion to foreign creditors. Its total assets of about $240 billion are dwarfed by its total liabilities.

“It is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,” the documents say.

About 90% of Evergrande’s business is in mainland China. Its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, was detained by authorities for suspected “illegal crimes” in late September, further complicating the company’s efforts to recover.

It’s unclear how the liquidation order will affect China’s financial system or Evergrande’s operations as it struggles to deliver housing that has been paid for but not yet handed over to families that put their life savings into such investments.

out55s,stocks,Amazon drops 137 billion in marketcap - a record.,"Amazon drops 7.5% today after earnings, losing 137.25 billion in one day. This is the biggest marketcap drop in one day. To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.3% in sp500, 0.63% in QQQ, 1.65% for consumer disc sector. The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household.

 Only 98 companies worldwide (of which 59 is us) have a marketcap of 137 billion+. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, previous miss was in October 2018, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash. Also jeff bezos fell to 2nd richest after today's drop.

In my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. If i would break down segments by importance it would be: 40% aws, 25% ads/other, 35% store. I think the aws/ads accelerating would increase stock price so if store was its own company, it would be a 22.5% drop. this drop is unjustified. I would consider to buy this stock but im more of an etf guy, so i dont have a position.

uslgss,stocks,"Dow drops 1,100 points for its biggest decline since 2020 as the sell-off this year on Wall Street intensifies","The Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for its biggest loss since 2020 on Wednesday after another major retailer warned of rising cost pressures, confirming investors’ worst fears over rising inflation and rekindling the brutal 2022 sell-off.

The Dow shed 1,255 points, or 3.8%, or the average’s biggest decline since October 2020. The S&P 500 traded 4.3% lower, the biggest drop since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.9%, the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just 13 members of the S&P 500 in the green.

Markets returned to heavy selling after two back-to-back quarterly reports from Target and Walmart stoked investor fears of rising inflation. It’s the fifth Dow decline of more than 800 points this year, which all occurred as the stock sell-off intensified within the last one month, according to FactSet data.

“It’s clear that transportation costs matter and they’re impacting [some of] the largest companies,” said Kim Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital. “So I think investors are scratching our heads going, ‘so, who’s next?’ And they’re giving visibility into what’s happening with the consumer.”

Target shares tumbled more than 27% Wednesday after the retailer reported first-quarter earnings that were much lower than Wall Street estimated because of higher costs for fuel and compensation. The retailer also saw lower-than-expected sales for discretionary merchandise like TVs.

The retailer’s report comes right after Walmart on Tuesday posted earnings that fell short of expectations as it too cited higher fuel and labor costs. Walmart shares ended Tuesday lower by 11%. They were down another 7% on Wednesday.

“The consumer is challenged,” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “We started to see at the end of the year that consumers were turning to credit cards to pay for the rise in food prices, rise in energy prices, and that’s actually gotten much worse. ...

Anyone bashing people about ""taking advice"" from Redditors, you're not witty, you're not smart, in fact you lack critical thinking. Reddit is a useful tool to crowd-source ideas. Think of it like a brainstorming session. The point of brainstorming is to gather a multitude of ideas from a diverse set of individuals no matter how good or bad these ideas might be. This allows you to potentially discover, and then investigate different perspectives that you may have overlooked. I'm not saying Reddit should be used as a substitute for published articles, classes, SEC filings, historical data, etc. but it can be an effective tool if used in conjunction with these other more formal tools.

If used correctly, Reddit can be a powerful tool to use in your research of a stock. It can give you different perspectives which you may have overlooked, and then you can follow up on those perspectives with further research.

[GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrxbvv/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_4/)

Before we get into what happened today I would like you all to know that I have sadly closed my position. I sold at the top today and then wanted to buy back in at the bottom but forgot about a little thing called wash sales. That being said when I purchased at 147 my cost basis was actually showing at \~250. Now, this is just for tax purposes however it was factored into margin and completely eliminated me from other trades and would have kept me sidelined for quite some time. I made the decision to close my position entirely and put a large sum of my capital into ACTC which will be my next DD. Sadly, I need to wait 30 days for the wash sale to wear off before I could re-enter GME. This bars me from participating in any upcoming squeezes without substantial risk and it prevents me from entering a long position prior to the 3/25 Earnings Report. This is very sad news indeed. However, I am extremely interested in what is happening and will continue monitoring the situation. I might play options although they are entirely to hard to predict, but I will be re-entering as soon as the wash sale wears off.

Side note: I am feeling better but not well enough to film, so for those who have been waiting for videos this week I do apologize, I will have content coming out as soon as I am able to record.

**So let's talk about today**

Well, if you read my last DD (Part 4) today went exactly as expected all the way up until the end. There was one crucial part I missed and that was the top of the downward channel which was $170. I kept mentioning $200 as an important number but completely disregarding the top of the channel. 

Alright, so pre-market kind of went sideways and that seemed to bode well for us. At open we saw a massive dip, my prediction was that this would be a sell-off of profit taking and bag holders leaving with their original investment. I still maintain that belief. We found the bottom at around $102 which was impressive to me so the following bounce seemed natural. We had several halts along the way and I want to clarify to everyone that this is completely normal.

Halting trades happens for those of us who can't be behind a computer at all times. It gives us a moment to catch up and make our decision. It also prevents a price from plummeting due to panic selling as it essentially pauses the trade to let people calm down and orders hold off for a second. It works well in the opposite direction to prevent FOMO from kicking in and prices rising to irrational heights quickly. 

I think a majority of the price action today was a combination of poorly positioned shorts covering and FOMO for a second squeeze. That in conjunction we scalpers and day traders, I think we simply had a lot of people playing this for profits on this push which gave us the volume and buying power we needed to surpass certain levels. 

We tested a few places on the way up, and some of those tests were rejected. The volume was able to push us through after 1-3 attempts. However, we met with the top of the channel, the $170 mark and at that point, we had no more gas, we had no more volume. We simply couldn't break through, there was a false break which brought us to the days high, but not enough to truly break out. If we did break it we would have been met by the massive sell wall at $200 which we surely would not have had the volume to break. We then were completely exhausted and were forced down significantly. In short, today was not our day.

There is a silver lining, even with AH we somehow ended up finishing over $106. This gives me hope. Let's immediately hop into what comes next.

**So...what comes next?**

All of the catalysts mentioned in Part 4 are still in effect, this has not changed. There are still many shorts sitting above $200 and some probably opened positions on the way down again. 

**Tomorrow** there is something still interesting to me. The fact that we ended over $100 and options expire tomorrow makes me thing there is still gas in this rocket to go for a second push tomorrow. No bears, no one really, could have expected this to close over $100 today, so a lot of calls are dangerously ITM. Tomorrow will be an all out assault for sure to try to drive the price as low as possible prior to the options expiring. Not only will this assault need to be dealt with, but nothing has changed with the $170 channel ceiling or the Wall of Troy at $200. Be warned folks, this is a battle. It is winnable, but a battle indeed. 

Without a known catalyst, this will be *extremely* difficult to win. Many things could happen, from whales jumping in to last minute news such as Cohen being named CEO (a leading theory regarding Ryan Cohen's mysterious tweet). 

Tomorrow, I expect the opposite reaction from today. Before I elaborate I would like to remind everyone: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I a wizard. I could be completely wrong about all of this. So please, do your research, make your decisions. Don't base your financial choices off of my one opinion. 

I digress, I expect an opposite reaction tomorrow with all the diamond handed apes riding whales screaming war cries in their final push before entering the gates of Valhalla. So I expect a massive run-up right at open. The question is...will it be enough? **Pay close attention to volume tomorrow and pay close attention to important resistance points we say today: 135, 152,155, 170.**

If volume low, that means everyone is waiting for everyone else to do something; this is assuredly a losing strategy. There will need to be a significant amount of volume to break through the first wall at 135. Hold on.

To make this more clear it is actually good to think of this like war. Imagine volume as the number of troops you have and imagine each resistance point as a gate you are storming. If you don't have the troops (volume) to break through the first gate (resistance point), you will need to regroup (consolidate) and try again. But each of these attempts uses more and more troops (volume), which means less (troops) to fight break through the following gates (resistance points).

So pay attention to volume and pay attention to resistance points and how many attempts you are taking to break each one. Without a general (a catalyst/whale) this will be a very difficult and potentially bloody battle tomorrow. 

From the oppositions perspective, they have two options. They could either bring troops out to meet you (try to force the price down right at open) or they can sit behind their gates and hold the line (bull trap). As I mentioned before, my guess is they will bull trap, why? Because that's what I would do. If we knew you couldn't break the 170 resistance on the first attempt with your whole army, why would we be concerned about reaching it with less troops? Again, volume is key to monitor.

If you see low volume + sharp price increase, it is likely the bull trap I am expecting, so have buy orders ready to go near resistance points and don't waste your resources trying to climb to them. 

If you see high volume + sharp price increase, then they probably sent troops out to meet you but you are winning.

If you see low volume + sharp price decrease, then it seems your reinforcements haven't arrived and you will need a miracle to save you.

If you see high volume + sharp price decrease, then they are winning.

If you are driven back then at least you are driven to reinforcements (IE: If the price is sent downward then it will be a good buying opportunity for more people to jump in and help the fight). Again, volume here is key. If you see a bounce back, make sure the volume is high enough to justify it, otherwise you are charging back into battle without enough reinforcements and will certainly lose. 

**After Tomorrow**

Until April I see potential for a squeeze, one even larger than the first. But every day that passes, every micro-squeeze in between weakens our side. Play it smart. Sell at what you think is the top, buy back in at the bottom. Rinse. Repeat. This gives each person more and more capital on every attempt. Placing buy orders around the resistance points to help break down the gates is essential. I want to clarify here, the only people who should be playing this are ones who are long on GME to begin with. At some point, this will all settle down, come back to Earth and you will be left with a lot of shares (especially if you keep selling and re-entering). 

The reason this works is because it's literally exactly what the shorts want. **The shorts want a short squeeze.** Yeah see, I said it. Everyone on every side is profiting on this phenomenon aside from the few casualties (bag holders) caught in the crossfire. They drive the price down by shorting it, then they cover to help trigger the short squeeze. You all ride it on the way up allowing them to open new very favorable positions not possible on other stocks and they ride it back down. The cycle continues. 

This is going to be the unfavored opinion, but the notion of diamond handing it til death isn't a winning tactic unless you have the capital to continue adding at the bottom. To win the war, that capital must be generated and what better way than this infinite game of profitable yo-yo?

**Diamond handing worked when there was 226% short interest and that is no longer the case.** 

**Diamond handing does not force a short squeeze, it only did the first time due to these conditions.** 

**Diamond handing worked because the shorts would be screwed if there was no one to buy their shares anymore, this is no longer reality. People are willing to sell their shares, if the price action doesn't convince you of that I don't know what will.** 

There is only one way to force a short squeeze. **Power.** Buying power that is. 

Again, I am not giving advice. This is my perspective and how I think a squeeze is possible WITHOUT a catalyst. 

**TL;DR:** I am not a spreader of FUD, I am a realist. If you are going to continue playing GME then you should find a way to profit from it. Volume is key. Important prices are: 135, 150, 155, 170, 200. The potential for tomorrow squeezing certainly exists with us finishing off at $106. They would have needed to send it much lower to make this be over. However, without a catalyst it will be a difficult battle indeed. This very well may have been the second squeeze, but as I mentioned in Part 4, I don't expect it to be the last one if it is, in fact, over.

They are trying to offer responsive ads similar to Google Ads but their implementation was designed very poorly: the variations in the ads are created at the moment you set up the original responsive ad, but these are static so if you need to make a change to a single image or field you need to edit all 25 variations, one by one.

I know and understand this is not a fool proof method, but it’s worked very well for me, and I think it could help some people to try and be critical and balanced, without pumping or cheerleading. It’s a two tiered system, and seems to provide all the necessary questions I need answering when I’m trying to decide to throw money at someone. 

**CORE**

>Product

-Is it something people have/find value in? Beneficial? Desirable? etc. You gotta have a good product.

>Management Focus

-Are the managers clowns, or industry pro's? Do they have a plan? Are they focused? Got vision? Will they take the company in a direction I think is profitable?

>Revenue

-How much revenue do they generate? Where does the spending money come from? How are sales? Service?

>Debt vs Assets

-Are they in the black or upside down like Stranger Things? Do they owe more than they make? What do they own that makes them money, vs what they have borrowed on that costs them money? How's the overhead?

>Risk

-Is it a pretty safe bet short term/long term? Does it seem feasible that they will grow or prosper, vs fall and break their own teeth out?

**Shell**

>Hype

-Are people taking about them? In the news? Is fucking reddit jerking off about them?

>Price

-Do I have to take a 2nd mortgage out to afford a good position? Can I pick up enough to make a fair profit with money I already have, or do I gotta clear some other holdings out to be where I want share wise?

>Potential

-Is the product, sector, industry, or climate even receptive to the business model? Is this some Beannie Babies shit, or the best thing since sliced bread?

>Activity

-Has the company even active? Are they enthusiastically pursuing success? Taking steps to be better? More efficient? Relevant? Innovative? Or, are they coasting along like a fat guy in Lazy River?

* Even more surprising about this development is that Florida does not allow for recreational use, but rather only with a medical card.

yrzodf,stocks,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls.

I import things from China. There are thousands of companies like mine. We are the one that sells shit to ur the distributors, the distributors sells to stores. We are also the one directly sells on Amazon and other e-commerce website. 

Pre COVID, a 40ft high cube costs me only $4000 from China to Long Beach. Currently it costs me god damn $20000, and that doesn’t include land transport. If I want to sent a container of goods to Ohio, the total cost on shipping alone is like $40000, excluding import duties. Back in the day shipping make up abt 30% of my cost, it makes up 60-70% now. Pre COVID a container of nice double layer fleece lining hoodies cost me 60k includes shipping. It costs me 100k this year. 

There are 110 some container ships stuck outside of Long Beach. You probably have no idea how many that is..ima use the nice fleece lining hoodies as example again. Each 40ft high cube carry’s 6000 this hoodie (so 20ft carry abt 3000). Each ship carry 20000 TEU (20ft equivalent units). there are also some 2 million TEU still in the port waiting to be hauled.. 

Let’s do the math

3000*20000=60 million hoodies 
110*20000=2.2million containers on ship stuck outside still. 
2.2million+2million=4.2 millions on containers total. 
4200000*60000000=252000000000000

US population is 333000000 
That’s 756 thousand hoodies for each person just stuck there waiting to be distributed! 

Let’s say my number is off by 50%, it’s still 378 thousands hoodies just stuck there! 

We can’t unload at Houston or New York cuz it will cost us even more… 

The problem Is not the demand, it’s supply. 

It’s not that there are too many monies were printed, who cares if we print more money, we can print unlimited useless pieces of paper and buy real goods from China ( export our Inflation)!

So, if u see on the news that the supply chain has been fixed, or the port of Long Beach has been cleared, or you know inflation is about to stapled.. until that , whatever the fed say is bs.

Side note Biden should declare national emergency and have nat guard come in and help haul these stucked goods.


Edit-----
Guys, sorry I did this math before I went to sleep on my phone.

My math is wrong.

It should be

3000*(110*20000+2000000)

=3000*4200000

12600000000/333000000=38.18 hoodies per person.

The worst thing is that people who have no clue get positively reinforced by members of this sub ""yeah totally yolo all your savings into GME"". This is not WSB, people should at least put some thought into their posts.

The moderators should be a lot tougher again and curate the sub more, keep out the toxicity, make sure people get useful advice and are not lead into financial ruin (some can't tell the difference between irony and serious advice). Several uses have suggested to put more of an emphasis on to FAQ and Q&A sections as well, many people already use the daily threads and and post good questions and discussions, let's increase its use.

The quality has deteriorated so much, I almost don't feel like scrolling through the sub anymore.

Excuse the wall of text but it's been bothering me for a while now, anybody else feel the same way or am I just delusional?

Edit: Thank you all for your contributions, seems like we got a real discussion going here, which is great, let's all stay civil though, even if it's a controversial topic, please don't insult the posters you don't agree with.",2021-01-24 11:45:41,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891659,1130 days 10:24:47.891659,617,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l3y04z/deteriorating_quality_of_this_sub/

fyjaff,stocks,Sharing my top companies with you.,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

r5qj2h,stocks,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns Congress that inflation may keep rising next year,"[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/)

""

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress that while the Federal Reserve continues to expect inflation will move down ""significantly"" over the next year, it ""now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year.""

The new COVID-19 variant Omicron could have a negative impact on employment and inflation, Powell told Congress Tuesday in his prepared remarks.

""The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation. Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,"" Powell said. He was appearing at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to testify about the economic recovery from the pandemic. 

The World Health Organization flagged Omicron as a COVID variant of concern on Friday: it appears to spread quickly, and it's not yet known how effective existing vaccines are against it. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, it'll be about two weeks before more is known about its transmissibility, severity and other characteristics.

The Biden administration acted quickly to try and slow the spread of the new variant in the U.S., imposing travel restrictions on eight countries in Southern Africa. Officials are also urging Americans to get vaccinated or booster shots. On Monday, President Biden sought to calm Americans, characterizing the variant as cause for concern, but not panic.

While Powell acknowledged that the economy is continuing to strengthen and conditions in the labor market are still improving, he also reminded senators that over the summer, the rapidly spreading Delta variant slowed the economic recovery and intensified supply chain disruptions.

At the same time, Americans have been slammed by higher than anticipated prices as the U.S. struggles to reopen. Last month's Consumer Price Index showed inflation had risen at its fastest annual rate in more than 30 years at 6.2%.

""Pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances have contributed to notable price increases in some areas. Supply chain problems have made it difficult for producers to meet strong demand, particularly for goods. Increases in energy prices and rents are also pushing inflation upward,"" Powell said during his remarks.

The remarks about inflation echo past statements by Powell that it could persist into the third quarter of 2022.

""We understand that high inflation imposes significant burdens, especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,"" Powell said. ""We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.""

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also testified before senators on the state of the economic recovery from the pandemic Tuesday. Yellen has said if the U.S. wants to bring inflation down, it needs to make progress with the pandemic and when it succeeds, she anticipates prices will go return to normal some time in the second half of next year.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to make progress in bringing down unemployment. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the jobs report for November. Last month, the economy added a higher than anticipated 531,000 jobs and revised the two prior reports upwards, after disappointing September and August numbers. The unemployment rate last month fell to 4.6%.""",2021-11-30 16:05:18,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891682,820 days 06:05:10.891683,795,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r5qj2h/fed_chairman_jerome_powell_warns_congress_that/

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla Inc. that would now need between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to close out, Elon Musk said Friday in a series of tweets.

Musk said the position was $500 million and grew after Tesla “went up a lot.”

When asked last year on CNBC whether he was short Tesla, Gates said, “I don’t talk about my investments.”

Musk was replying to tweets after the close of his Twitter poll asking who respondents trust less -- politicians or billionaires. More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.

mphtpx,stocks,There's a reason why people tell you to only invest money you don't need in the foreseeable future.,"I've seen at least 2 post today on reddit of people claiming that they are gonna pull their money out of the stock market due to consistent losses. Most of their holding are stocks that were once popular on reddit and more than likely they bought at the very top of the hype but that's not here nor there. The fact is that if you invest money that you don't need any time soon you can just ride the wave of losses.

I'm personally living paycheck to paycheck and could definitely use the money I have invested but I keep trying to see that money as LOST already. Maybe not the greatest thing but I'm definitely not dependent on it and don't plan on using it anytime soon. There's a certain Game ticker that has lost me a ton of money these last 2 weeks and I haven't bat an eye because I'm not counting on that money. 

I know a lot of us have been and continue to be broke and when we hear people on reddit discussing a damn near certain winner you want to jump in and make some money. But the truth is most of the time it's either a Pump and Dump and more often than not these people are just wrong. 

So my advice to  you is if you can't afford to invest money and not touch it for at least a year whether it goes up or down then just don't invest that money. You'll most likely pull out too soon and just lose money.",2021-04-12 16:44:36,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891693,1052 days 05:25:52.891693,456,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mphtpx/theres_a_reason_why_people_tell_you_to_only/
wqgtmn,stocks,"Just a reminder to all young, long term investors. You do NOT need a financial advisor. They just want your $","I’m a long term investor, two years ago I made the novice mistake of scheduling an appointment with a wealth advisor. I knew nothing about investing, and this is obviously something she recognized and took advantage of. I opened up a Roth IRA and a taxable account with them, I had no clue what I even had. It was whatever she picked, lots of various ETF’s/bonds etc. 

I was being charged 0.35% per quarter, the balance quietly being taken out each quarter. 

Thanks to subs like this and r/Bogleheads, I found out I was being ripped off big time. 

I was being charged an outrageous amount for something I didn’t need. 

I promptly emailed my advisor and asked if negotiation was possible, as I was concerned about the fee adding up long term. I was told “no”, just wow…how greedy can you be?

I made an account with Schwab and transferred my investments over. I then sold everything and bought VT. 

Schwab’s customer service is wonderful


Just a reminder to not make the mistake I made! Luckily I only had about a year of that mistake, compared to 30.


Obviously you have to be cautious when listening to anyone online, but if you’re a young, long term investor…a low cost well known ETF really is hard to beat. Pick something like VTI or VT and call it a day. Schwab, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade are some of the reputable  ones to go with  

People can have their little debates about international or US only but I mean as long as you’re picking something low cost then you’re good.

 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Bing may replace Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search service on Samsung Electronics Co. devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. 

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground. Those include adding artificial intelligence features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported.",2023-04-17 11:24:59,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891711,317 days 10:45:29.891712,517,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12pcfpt/google_falls_3_premarket_as_microsoft_gains_2_on/
9su0zw,stocks,I predict Amazon will acquire Lyft in the next 18 months.,"Lyft is five times cheaper to acquire than Uber. It has 35% of ridesharing marketshare in America and is rapidly growing in Canada—two of Amazon's biggest market. 

Currently, no major Western ridesharing platform is profitable. That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. 

Amazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. 

Then, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low—effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. 

The operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.

x7gd8d,stocks,Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children’s privacy settings on Instagram,"check this out

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)

A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

jw80m4,stocks,Home Depot is spending $1 billion to give thousands of its workers a raise,"Sitting on bumper profits and cash as consumers remodel their homes during the pandemic, Home Depot ([HD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD?p=HD&.tsrc=fin-srch)) is joining a growing list of big box retailers giving its workers a raise after a busy and challenging year during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The home improvement retailer said Tuesday it will invest $1 billion in what it calls ‘incremental compensation’ annually for its workers. A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company’s average hourly wage will increase after the investment.

“It varies market by market. Our compensation, at all levels, is based on skills, responsibilities, performance and market rates,” the spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. [According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour. A sales associate earns $12 an hour, per Glassdoor.

The spokesperson said the “majority” of Home Depot’s 400,000 total employees will receive a pay bump from the new investment.

Other big box chains — sitting on big profits as consumers have stocked up on food and cleaning products amidst the pandemic — have also opened their wallets.

In July, [Target raised its starting wage for its store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-raises-minimum-wage-for-store-distribution-and-headquarter-employees-114504219.html), distribution and headquarter employees to $15 an hour. The move impacted 275,000 employees who work at the company’s stores and distribution centers. Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.

Walmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.

The world’s largest retailer’s pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.

“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said recently at the [Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit](https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit/).

10ys3z8,stocks,"Russia announces it will cut oil output by 500,000 barrels a day next month in retaliation against Western sanctions"," Russia will cut oil production from next month in response to the price cap imposed by western nations, the country’s top energy official said, in the first sign Moscow is moving to weaponize oil supplies after slashing natural gas exports to Europe last year.

The cut of 500,000 barrels a day, the equivalent of about 5 per cent of Russia’s production or 0.5 per cent of world supply, will help “restore market relations”, Alexander Novak said in a statement on Friday.

The announcement comes days after the latest EU sanctions and other western measures against the Russian oil sector took effect in retaliation for Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and just two weeks before the one-year anniversary of the start of the war.

The EU extended its ban on seaborne imports of Russian crude to cover refined fuels such as diesel and petrol on February 5, while the G7 simultaneously imposed a price cap on the same fuels buyers must abide by if they are to access western tanker and insurance markets.

Novak, who is deputy prime minister and leads Russia’s negotiations with the Opec+ group of oil producers, has long warned that Moscow could retaliate against western measures designed to hit its oil revenues.

“Russia believes the price cap mechanism for selling Russian oil and oil products interferes with market relations,” Novak said. “It continues the destructive energy policy of the countries of the collective west.”

Brent crude, the international benchmark, jumped 2.3 per cent to $86.43 a barrel immediately after the announcement on Friday, having earlier traded largely flat on the day.

They were put in my parents name.  We found the actual stock certificates after going through some old boxes.   Apparently in 2016 the state I live in (Virginia) sold the stock as there are some laws that say(I'm terribly paraphrasing as I don't understand this at all) if nothing was done with the stock and it was deemed inactive, ownership of the stock is given to the state of the last known residence of the original owner.  We called the state office and they told us to fill out a bunch of paperwork and submit it to the state to see what can be done about recouping some of the funds from the sale.  

Sorry if this is not the right place for this post or if it doesn't make sense lol I'm just trying to find some answers.  Some friends of mine mentioned that with the Disney stock splits back in the 90s those 24 shares could have turned into a decent amount of cash.  I appreciate any insight you all could provide!

Edit: I'm looking at them now.  The 8 shares bought in 1992 were purchased in December of that year so post split and the 16 shares purchased in 1998 were purchased on July 9th of that year.  So would that mean the 8 from 1992 would have turned into 24 in 1998 and the 16 bought in 1998 look like they missed the split by like 3 weeks (lol god dammit) for a total of 40 shares in 2016 when the state sold them?",2021-04-26 17:20:57,2024-02-28 22:10:28.891761,1038 days 04:49:31.891762,293,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mz2ue8/grandparents_left_me_disney_stock_but_never_told/
nupy68,stocks,Peter Lynch's 10 mistakes every investor makes,"""It can't go any lower."" Never make such an assumption. A bad company can and will go lower.

""How much higher can it go?"" Selling too early just because a stock goes up.

""They always come back"" Don't assume a stock price will rebound, look at the fundamentals not the price.

""How much can I lose?"" A cheap stock price doesn't = a good value. You can lose % at any price.

""It's always darkest before dawn."" It's a terrible business but it's down 80%! Buy at a discount? no, it still has room to drop.

""I will sell after rebound"" Buy at $10, it falls to $6, and you think ""If it goes back to $10 I'll sell. Well if you think that you should buy more! A key to remember, the stock doesn't know you own it. It may never get to $10 again as well. Don't take it personal. Make decisions based on fundamentals.

""Don't worry, I own conservative stocks"" (utilities...)

""Look at the money I lost because I didn't buy"" FOMO? Hundreds of stocks go up double digits. Don't worry about other stocks. Focus on ones you know. You can't lose money on a stock you don't own.

""Stock is up I must be right / Stock is down I must be wrong."" Stocks go up and down a lot each year. The ups and downs don't mean much in the short term.

Avoid longshots. Investing based on rumors, comments, anything other than sound financial analysis and valuation.

nws8lb,stocks,Microsoft is developing new hardware to bring its ‘Netflix for games’ service to TVs,"Microsoft is developing dedicated streaming hardware that people will be able to hook up to their TVs to use its Netflix\-like cloud gaming service.

The company is betting the future of video games will be a subscription-based model where people pay a certain amount of money each month to get access to a plethora of titles.

Its Xbox Game Pass service does exactly that, offering access to a library of games developed both in-house and by third-party studios.

That’s mostly digital downloads, but last year streaming was added with Microsoft publicly releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming. The feature is sort of like a “Netflix for games,” allowing gamers to play games that are hosted on remote servers and then streamed to users over the internet.

A number of other companies have launched similar game-streaming services, including Google with Stadia and Amazon with Luna.

Now, Microsoft is aiming to push its cloud gaming product to other platforms. It started rolling out Xbox Cloud Gaming to some users via a web browser on iPhones, iPads and PCs in April (Microsoft couldn’t launch a proper mobile app for cloud gaming on Apple devices due to a dispute over App Store policies). And on Thursday, the company announced it wants to expand the service to TVs as well.

One way it plans to do that is by partnering with manufacturers to add cloud gaming to smart TVs. But Microsoft is also developing streaming devices which users can plug into their TV or computer monitor to stream games from the cloud. The company didn’t elaborate on what those devices could look like, though it’s reminiscent of Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast dongles, both of which now support cloud gaming.

In addition, Microsoft says it is working with mobile carriers like Telstra in Australia to offer new Xbox subscription models. It’s also expanding cloud gaming to four new countries — Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan —  later this year, and aims to publicly launch the browser-based version of the software to all members of its $15-a-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in the coming weeks.

Microsoft said it plans to add cloud gaming to its new Xbox Series X console, which launched last November to compete with Sony’s PlayStation 5. In the next few weeks, the company will also upgrade the servers that power its cloud gaming service from its old Xbox One hardware to the Xbox Series X.

Microsoft competes aggressively with Sony when it comes to gaming. But it’s taking a different strategy to its Japanese counterpart. While Sony is known for blockbuster exclusives that can only be played on a PlayStation console, Microsoft is focusing on embedding its Xbox services onto multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.

Microsoft has been stepping up its investments in gaming, buying the iconic studio Bethesda for $7.5 billion in its biggest video game-related acquisition yet.

The company is holding a joint event with Bethesda on Sunday as part of the E3 gaming conference to show off new games, with fans speculating they will reveal some details about a hotly-anticipated sci-fi game called Starfield.

(PAYWALL)

From the Article:

Recent revelations and scrutiny from Congress over Facebook's(FB) role in society  could lead to major lawsuits against the social-media giant, according to new  research that drew comparisons with litigation faced by Big Tobacco or Purdue  Pharma. 

Facebook (FB) has been  under pressure following a series of reports by The Wall Street  Journal that made allegations covering Instagram's impact on teenagers'  mental health, whether its algorithm encouraged social discord, and how it  moderates elites. 

A company whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Journal also  testified before Congress last week, as lawmakers turned their  attention to the renewed public debate over Facebook's(FB) prominent role in peoples' lives. 

Facebook (FB) co-founder  and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said that ""many of the claims  don't make any sense,"" pushing back against allegations that arose in the  Journal's reports and the whistleblower's testimony, in a post on social  media. 

Blair Levin, an analyst at London-based technology industry research  group New Street Research, wrote Sunday that "" while we have been  skeptical that past revelations would lead to government action, we think this  time is different and as a result, we think Facebook(FB) may now face a similar challenge from  increased litigation as tobacco, or more recently, OxyContin."" 

Levin served as chief of staff to the chair of the Federal  Communications Commission in the 1990s. 

The analyst said that while the facts and damages are different for Facebook(FB) than those faced by  the tobacco industry or Purdue Pharma -- the maker of opioid medication  OxyContin -- the fundamental legal framework is the same. 

There is a product with problematic consequences for many people, management  knowledge of such, and actions by management ""that not only failed to mitigate  the harm but arguably increased those problematic consequences,"" Levin said. 

In the same way that public outcry against tobacco and opioid makers led to  massive class action and state attorneys general-led lawsuits, Levin said the  recent revelations against Facebook(FB) creates similar incentives to bring  litigation against the company. 

While Facebook(FB) has  faced scrutiny before, there is far more attention on the company this time, in  part because of the role that harms to children plays in the recent allegations,  Levin noted. 

""Discovery is likely to yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook(FB), and the dynamics  create an opportunity for a settlement that would address the issues more  quickly than legislation,"" Levin said. ""We think litigation is likely to be more  damaging to Facebook(FB)  than legislation.""

Economists are expecting another hot inflation report, with the headline consumer price index running at a 7.2% pace in January.

CPI is reported Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET and is expected to show an increase of 0.4%, a slower monthly increase than December, which had a revised headline gain of 0.6%. The year-over-year forecast of 7.2% is the highest since 1982 and is up from 7% in December.

Core inflation, excluding food and energy, is expected to rise 0.4% in January or 5.9% year-over-year, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a monthly increase of 0.6% in December and a year-over-year pace of 5.5% in the final month of last year.

CPI is key for the markets since inflation is seen as a direct trigger for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, and economists are basing their forecasts for the central bank on how much they think inflation will slow from its rapid pace. The Fed has made clear it will fight inflation, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year, starting with a quarter-point hike in March.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd will hand over its business in Russia to a state-owned entity for 1 euro ($0.97), it said on Tuesday, taking a loss of around $687 million and exiting the country months after it was forced to halt production there. The Japanese company will transfer its shares in Nissan Manufacturing Russia LLC to state-owned NAMI, it said. The deal will give Nissan the right to buy back the business within six years, Russia’s industry and trade ministry said. The deal makes Nissan the latest major company to exit Russia since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. It also mirrors a move by Nissan’s top shareholder, French automaker Renault, which sold its majority stake in Russian carmaker Avtovaz to a Russian investor in May. The sale to NAMI will include Nissan’s production and research facilities in St Petersburg as well as its sales and marketing center in Moscow, the ministry said.

Nissan said it expected an extraordinary loss of around 100 billion yen ($687 million), but maintained its earnings forecast for the financial year ending in March. Nissan had suspended production at its St. Petersberg plant in March due to supply chain disruptions. Since then, the company and its local unit had been monitoring the situation, it said. But there was “no visibility” of a change to the external environment, Nissan said, prompting it to decide to exit.

Junior alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp is also considering exiting Russia, the Nikkei newspaper said. A spokesperson for Mitsubishi said nothing had been decided. The exit comes as Nissan has embarked on a major shift in its relationship with Renault. The two said on Monday they were in talks about the future of their alliance, including Nissan considering investing in a new electric vehicle venture by Renault. Renault reportedly sold its stake in Avtovaz for one ruble ($0.02).

11prs3r,stocks,Breaking: SVB depositors to have access to -all- money on Monday; Fed announces new emergency bank term funding program,"March 12, 2023

Federal Reserve Board announces it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors

To support American businesses and households, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions  to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.  This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. 

The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.

The financing will be made available through the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral.  These assets will be valued at par.  The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution’s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress.

nlhpv3,stocks,Dutch court rules oil giant Shell must cut carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 in landmark case," LONDON — A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled oil giant [Royal Dutch Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDS.A) must reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

That’s a much higher reduction than the company’s current aim of lowering its emissions by 20% by 2030.

Shell’s current [climate strategy](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/our-climate-target/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1621314462494/d53de79d4e951642456e928cdfd18b0a1867cf4d/our-climate-target.pdf) states that the company is aiming to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, with the company setting a target of cutting its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2035.

CNBC contacted Shell to request a comment on the ruling.

Shares of Shell were trading 0.3% lower in London. The stock price is up almost 10% year-to-date, having tumbled nearly 40% in 2020.

The lawsuit was filed in April 2019 by seven activist groups — including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace — on behalf of 17,200 Dutch citizens. Court summons claimed [Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDSA-GB)’s business model “is endangering human rights and lives” by posing a threat to the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement.

Under the Paris Agreement — a landmark deal adopted in 2015 and signed by 195 countries — nations agreed to a framework to prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2 degrees Celsius, although the accord aims to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At Shell’s annual general meeting last week, shareholders [voted overwhelmingly in favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/shell-secures-backing-for-climate-strategy-but-growing-minority-rebel.html) of the company’s energy transition plans — but, crucially, a growing minority rejected the strategy, insisting the oil giant needed to do much more in the fight against climate change.

Activist investor Follow This said at the time that the result was likely to mean Shell would have to revise its climate targets once again.

According to Reuters, the case is the first in which activists have taken a major energy firm to court to compel it to overhaul its climate strategy.

When the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer acting on behalf of environmental groups said the case would “raise the pressure” on other fossil fuel companies.

laln2m,stocks,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,"Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.

**EDIT3:** Revolut has set AMC and GME to sell only today. I can’t wrap my head around these moves, but the squeeze is over? Not likely...something simply doesn’t add up here

**EDIT4:** Today’s volume already blows away yesterday’s and Fridays giving more merit to my thesis. Trading restrictions still have complete blocks on GME but RH opened the flood gates an hour ago. My God this stock is exhilarating.

**EDIT5 - 02/03 08:17** I know everyone wants an update to my option and I would love to give one. Sadly the transformer in my building has blown and the power is out on my entire side of they building. This means no heat and no electricity. My dog and I are freezing and worse than that I work from home. 

A quick update on my personal opinion, I’m still bullish. Yesterday was expected, I didn’t think it would go under $100 but we figured it would be bloody. Today is very interesting with T+2 definitely being over that means we are starting to get some Failure To Delivers. GameStop getting listed on the [short restriction list ](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210202.xls) makes things interesting as well. Apparently Warren is also pushing for an emergency meeting, just speculating but it could result in a 30 day trading halt. Moral of the story, I’m still bullish, Im still holding, this is all speculation, anyone who pretends it isn’t speculation is full of shit. You ultimately have to decide.

Zoom blog post: https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-from-eric-yuan-ceo-of-zoom/

Zoom on Tuesday announced plans to cut about 1,300 workers, or 15% of its workforce, according to a blog post shared to the company’s website.

Shares of Zoom were up about 6% Tuesday.

CEO Eric Yuan wrote in the blog post that as the world continues to adjust to life after the pandemic, the company needs to adapt to the “uncertainty of the global economy” as well as “its effect on our customers.”

Zoom experienced a huge boom during the pandemic when people were forced to work from home and turned to video chat software to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family.

“We worked tirelessly and made Zoom better for our customers and users. But we also made mistakes,” Yuan said. “We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities.” 

Yuan said the cuts will impact every organization across Zoom, and employees will be offered up to 16 weeks of salary and healthcare coverage. Yuan also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also foregoing is 2023 corporate bonuses.

“As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today– and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,” he wrote in the post.

The company’s layoff announcement marks the latest round of job cuts in the tech industry, as Dell on Monday announced plans to cut 6,650 jobs. In January, Google revealed plans to lay off more than 12,000 workers, Microsoft disclosed plans to cut 10,000 employees and Salesforce announced plans to lay off 7,000 workers.",2023-02-07 17:44:53,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525445,386 days 04:25:37.525445,370,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10w810w/zoom_to_lay_off_1300_employees_or_about_15_of_its/

n6dl5x,stocks,New Investors: The average return of the stock market is 10% per year over time.,"2020 was an unprecedented year. New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

Keep your head high, stay invested, let your investments compound, just don't be saddened when your returns are at or slightly below average moving forward. You're still doing better than those that don't invest at all.",2021-05-06 18:09:39,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525453,1028 days 04:00:51.525453,473,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6dl5x/new_investors_the_average_return_of_the_stock/
jo7xm6,stocks,Bezos sells more than $3 billion worth of Amazon shares,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week has sold more than $3 billion worth of shares in his company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission compiled by OpenInsider.

Bezos has accelerated his stock sales in the last year. In August, Bezos offloaded more than $3.1 billion of Amazon shares, after selling more than $4.1 billion worth of shares in February. The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to more than $10.2 billion so far, which is a notable jump from 2019, when Bezos sold $2.8 billion worth of shares.

Even with the latest stock sale, Bezos still owns more than 53 million shares worth nearly $170 billion, making him the richest person in the world.

The transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings. Amazon declined to comment on the latest sale.

Bezos has previously said he sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year to fund his rocket start-up, Blue Origin. Additionally, the Amazon CEO in February launched a $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change, which will issue grants to scientists, activists and other organizations.

While Bezos hasn't yet announced the recipients of the fund, The Atlantic reported Tuesday that Bezos is expected to give $100 million each to the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund.

Warren sure sounds like a shill for big business. Also, people keep acting surprised that rate hikes are still continuing, just like clearly outlined for months.

lxo7om,stocks,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",2021-03-04 16:14:17,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525476,1091 days 05:56:13.525476,606,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxo7om/warren_buffets_stock_strategy_is_more_relevant/

USPS delivered 1.54 billion packages for Amazon during the time period, or roughly 30% of the technology company's total volume, according to the documents, which also show that deliveries and revenue increased in fiscal year 2019.

Simply put, in return for the lower rates, the USPS keeps a large customer, and staves off a possible future in which Amazon builds out its own delivery fleet, including drone deliveries for rual areas, to the extent it doesn't need the USPS's delivery network — or even begins competing with USPS to deliver some non-Amazon packages as well.

Computer storage company Seagate will pay a $300 million penalty for allegedly continuing an unauthorized $1.1 billion relationship with Chinese technology firm Huawei after the company was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2020. The $300 million settlement, announced by the Department of Commerce on Wednesday, is the largest ever imposed by Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which enforces export controls against blacklisted companies like Huawei. Federal regulators said Seagate was Huawei’s sole provider of hard drive disks, or HDDs, resulting in around $150 million in profit for the hard drive maker.

Seagate shipped over 7.4 million HDDs to Huawei from Aug. 2020 to Sept. 2021, federal regulators said. Neither Huawei nor Seagate made an apparent effort to hide their relationship, according to federal charging documents. “Seagate well seized the opportunity and successfully won the big share,” Huawei allegedly said. Seagate also allegedly extended lines of credit totaling $1 billion to the Chinese company. Those lines of credit allowed Huawei to order an “increasing volume” of HDDs, federal regulators said, that Huawei wouldn’t have been able to pay for otherwise. “All the while, Seagate’s competitors declined similar exports,” a Commerce Department press release said. Even after export controls were imposed, a senior Seagate executive publicly justified the continued relationship with Huawei, regulators alleged. “I don’t see any particular restriction for us,” the executive reportedly said.

Seagate prioritized its relationship with Huawei over at least one U.S. customer, federal regulators alleged, with one executive writing that the company “moved supply to support China,” even after export controls had been imposed. “Even after Huawei was placed on the Entity List for conduct inimical to our national security, and its competitors had stopped selling to them due to our foreign direct product rule, Seagate continued sending hard disk drives to Huawei,” assistant secretary for export enforcement Matthew Axelrod said in a statement.",2023-04-20 13:57:39,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525488,314 days 08:12:51.525489,223,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12szk4l/seagate_hit_with_300_million_penalty_for/

n5ikkk,stocks,Peloton Recalls Treadmills After Safety Warnings,"https://nyti.ms/2QZBxiN

Peloton is recalling its Tread+ and Tread treadmills, the at-home fitness company said on Wednesday, less than a month after it fought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission as it warned that dozens of injuries and one death of a child had been linked to the machines.

The commission, which issued an “urgent warning” for the machines in April, urged people who own the treadmills to immediately stop using them. Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.

John Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”

“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.

The machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.

The commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.

After the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children",2021-05-05 15:27:26,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525505,1029 days 06:43:04.525505,694,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n5ikkk/peloton_recalls_treadmills_after_safety_warnings/

Rivian Automotive Inc. intends to recall about 13,000 vehicles due to a possible safety issue that has so far been found to have impacted several units, the company said Friday night. 

The maker of electric SUVs and trucks said that it was making the move to deal with an “insufficiently torqued fastener” that caused issues in seven instances, though no related injuries have been reported.

The Wall Street Journal reported on the issue Friday night, observing that the recall affected “nearly all” of Rivian’s vehicles. The company communicated to customers that they should stop driving their vehicles if they notice “steering or suspension problems,” per the report, which noted that this marks Rivian’s third recall since it started producing vehicles last year. The previous recalls affected smaller numbers of vehicles and covered airbag and seatbelt issues. 

A company spokesperson confirmed to MarketWatch that the company was “committed to fixing this issue on any affected vehicles as quickly as possible” and would get in touch “immediately” with affected customers to make appointments for inspections or potential repairs. Any repairs will be completed free of charge at a Rivian RIVN, -7.64% service station and handled in a few minutes, according to the company.

11p4ghc,stocks,Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Explained in under 400 words.,"# Introduction:

Silicon Valley Bank(SVB) is a bank that primarily serves Venture Capital/Private Equity firms in areas such as Technology and Medical start ups.

&#x200B;

# Reasons:

**Interest rates environment**

In 2021, SVB received a substantial amount of deposit due to overall economy booming. It bought a lot of government treasury bonds at a low interest rate. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1)) Government bonds are not bad but they are exposed to interest rate risk.  
However, as the FEDs started raising interest rates it reduced the value of bonds SVB had outstanding. When FEDs raise interest rates, this leads to higher coupon rates on newer bonds so older bonds are sold off to capitalize on the higher coupon rates, which in turn reduces the price of older bonds i.e. their value.   


IF a firm had held these bonds till maturity, no losses are made. However, due to poor environment it led to lower investment into VCs so more VCs pulled their deposits out. SVB had very little liquidity so it was forced to realize the losses on the older bonds. ([Source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)) Higher uncertainty as more bad news of losses from SVB began piling up, it led to even more deposits being withdrawn and more losses crystalizing leading to a loop of destruction. 

So, SVB wants to avoid losses, it tries to hold securities till maturity i.e. Held to maturity(HTM) assets. Accounting practices allows for HTM to be in terms of par value and not the updated value.

According to the 2022 10-K, SVB has total deposits of about 173 billion but only 118 billion in relatively liquid assets. BUT 76% of liquid assets are in HTM, that 76% is according to PAR VALUE so the actual worth of HTM today could be significantly lower.  


**Signaling**  
In finance, there's a theory called the Signaling theory. Basically, when a firm issues out new stocks its foresees losses ahead and wants to spread the losses among a larger number of shareholders, as it is also in manager's best interest to do so due to them usually having a stake in the company. SVB announced a $2.25 billion equity financing plan to raise capital. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1))  


**Large Exposure to Diversity Risk.**

SVB's main customers had more or less the same demographic so the deposits owned by SVB are more or less the same. There's very high correlation between the deposits, a withdrawal most likely will trigger another withdrawal as customers are facing the same extent of losses or same issues so the diversity risk is high.",2023-03-12 03:51:38,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525523,353 days 18:18:52.525523,409,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11p4ghc/silicon_valley_bank_collapse_explained_in_under/

ltf3iq,stocks,I am bullish about the future,"People seem to think because we had 2 big crash close together in 2000 and 2008, we are bound to have one soon.


I want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.


Secondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.


Thirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its ""bad"", but obviously it isn't bad.


Another point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.


Another point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.


Now check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg


Obviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio


Its irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.



So hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.


A correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.

lrd6uz,stocks,$PLTR - A word of caution.,"Now let me start off by saying that I am very bullish on Palantir when talking about the company, their software, and their operations. However, when it comes to the stock, I don’t really see a lot of short-term growth (talking 1-2 years). 

My strong conviction was ever increased as I watched their Demo-Day livestream a while back. I believe that Karp’s vision of them being the world’s most important software company may very well become true someday. My conviction in Palantir and their future is perhaps stronger than on any other growing company. 
However, when it comes to their stock price and valuation, I am standing back. I initially bought in at around $15 dollars, saw the first run up to $30 and then averaged up after the drop to around $22. I held and sold my entire position at the peak of $44 (I got lucky timing, for once). This was before the lock-up period ended. I knew this price point wouldn’t hold with the lock-up approaching so I sold my position after more than doubling my money.

Now that the lock-up has expired, the amount of added shares to the public has resulted in a large shift in relation of the share price - to - market cap. I would’ve found yesterdays $24 as a buying opportunity BEFORE the lock-up, but not anymore. Palantir now has a $50B market cap on ~ $1B annual revenue, that is insane, no matter the future growth prospects. They will not reach even close to $2B in revenue in 2021 and people are shouting $50 or $100 share price targets for EOY. This is utterly detached from reality. A $50 price tag would mean a ~ $100B market cap on +$1B in revenue, and $100 would be a $200B market cap. No matter the current nature of the market, valuations still do matter (no matter how alarmingly little at the moment). 

I would personally love to re-enter Palantir, but I am not going to at the current prices. I’d re-enter at around or sub $30B market cap. The share price would have to obviously drop quite significantly, but the lock-up period has drastically changed the relation of the share-price to Palantir’s valuation when compared to the time before the lock-up. I personally do not see anything above $20 as a steal, but rather overvalued in current and short-term (1-2 years) perspectives. I understand people looking long-term (that’s great), but I’d rather enter something else for now than sail relatively flat for the next year or two on current valuations. 

I’ll probably get downvoted to the core of the earth because Palantir has that same unhinged and almost religious following that Tesla has for example, but this is just my level-headed two cents to my fellow retail investors.

More than 1,000 workers at the Tyson Foods plant in Waterloo have tested positive for the coronavirus, a county public health leader said Thursday - more than double the number Gov. Kim Reynolds had said the day before.

The 1,031 Tyson employees confirmed to have the coronavirus included workers who were tested at the plant during the shutdown as well as at private health-care providers, Black Hawk County public officials said.

Reynolds said Wednesday that 444 workers at Tyson's Waterloo plant had tested positive.

The others were Tyson pork processing plants in Columbus Junction and Perry, and an Iowa Premium beef processing plant in Tama.Joshua Pikora, disease surveillance and investigation manager in Black Hawk County, where the Waterloo plant is located, said the governor's numbers for Waterloo reflected tests conducted only at the Tyson plant, not at health facilities elsewhere.

Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, and Tom Hart, the Waterloo plant manager, detailed the added measures the company has taken to ensure worker safety.

obdhf3,stocks,Robinhood to pay $70 million fine after causing ‘widespread and significant harm’ to customers,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html

Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers “widespread and significant” harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years. That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S. Specifically, FINRA’s investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.

The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users. Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users. Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.

“We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,” she says. Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading. FINRA’s investigation found that Robinhood’s customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.

FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has “negligently communicated false and misleading information” at different times since September 2016. Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed. While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has “failed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,” relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.

“As a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,” FINRA writes. Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars. Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns.",2021-07-01 03:44:08,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525564,972 days 18:26:22.525564,311,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/obdhf3/robinhood_to_pay_70_million_fine_after_causing/

Over the three-year-long pause on student loan payments, the U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly told borrowers their bills were set to resume, only to take it back and provide them more time.This time, however, the agency really means it.The Education Department posted on its website that “payments will be due starting in October,” and a recent law passed by Congress will make changing that plan difficult. It will likely be a big adjustment for borrowers when the pandemic-era policy expires. Around 40 million Americans have debt from their education. The typical monthly bill is roughly $350.“For many borrowers, the payment pause has been life altering — saving many from financial ruin and allowing others to finally get ahead financially,” said Persis Yu, deputy executive director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Here’s what to know.

3-year pause saved the average borrower $15,000 

Former President Donald Trump first announced the stay on federal student loan bills and the accrual of interest in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. and crippled the economy. The pause has since been extended eight times. Nearly all people eligible for the relief have taken advantage of it, with less than 1% of qualifying borrowers continuing to make payments on their education debt, according to an analysis by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

As a result of the policy, the average borrower likely saved around $15,000 in student loan payments, Kantrowitz said. Why the pause will end in the fall The Education Department notes on its financial aid website that “Congress recently passed a law preventing further extensions of the payment pause.” It is referring to the agreement reached between Republicans and Democrats to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, which President Joe Biden signed into law in early June. In exchange for voting to increase the borrowing limit, Republicans demanded large cuts to federal spending. They sought to repeal Biden’s executive action granting student loan forgiveness, but the Biden administration refused to agree to that. However, included in the deal was a provision that officially terminates the pause at the end of August.

Even before that agreement, the Biden administration had been preparing borrowers for their payments to resume by September. “The emergency period is over, and we’re preparing our borrowers to restart,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona recently said at a Senate hearing.Interest will pick up in September, payments in October The Education Department says borrowers will be expected to make their first post-pause payment in October. Meanwhile, interest will start accumulating on borrowers’ debt again on Sept. 1, the department says.Exact due dates will vary based on your account details, Kantrowitz said.“Your due date will be at least 21 days after you’re sent a loan statement,” he said. Borrowers don’t know what they’ll owe As the Biden administration tries to ready millions of Americans to restart their student loan payments, there’s one big open question that may make that preparation difficult: Most borrowers don’t know what they’ll owe in the fall.That’s because the Supreme Court has yet to issue a verdict on the validity of Biden’s plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for borrowers. A decision is expected this month. Around 37 million people would be eligible for some loan cancellation, Kantrowitz estimated.

Roughly a third of those with federal student loans, or 14 million people, would have their balances entirely forgiven by the president’s program, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. As a result, these borrowers won’t owe anything come October. For those who still have a balance after the relief, the Education Department has said it plans to “re-amortize” borrowers’ lower debts. That’s a wonky term that means it will recalculate people’s monthly payment based on their lower tab and the number of months they have left on their repayment timeline.Kantrowitz provided an example: Let’s say a person currently owes $30,000 in student loans at a 5% interest rate. Before the pandemic, they would have paid around $320 a month on a 10-year repayment term. If forgiveness goes through and that person gets $10,000 in relief, their total balance would be reduced by a third, and their monthly payment will drop by a third, to roughly $210 a month.

Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal recently warned that if the administration is unable to deliver on Biden’s loan forgiveness, delinquency and default rates could skyrocket. The borrowers most in jeopardy of defaulting are those for whom Biden’s policy would have wiped out their balance entirely, Kvaal said. “Unless the Department is allowed to provide one-time student loan debt relief,” Kvaal said, “we expect this group of borrowers to have higher loan default rates due to the ongoing confusion about what they owe.”",2023-06-20 22:49:52,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525580,252 days 23:20:38.525580,1061,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14epyjf/its_official_student_loan_payments_will_restart/

Amazon will lay off 9,000 more employees in the coming weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday.

The cuts are on top of the previously announced layoffs that began in November and extended into January. That round affected more than 18,000 employees.

Amazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs and took into account the uncertain economy, as well as the “uncertainty that exists in the near future,” Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as “OP2.”

“The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole,” Jassy said.

The latest round will primarily impact Amazon’s cloud computing, human resources, advertising and Twitch livestreaming businesses, Jassy said in the memo.",2023-03-20 14:56:39,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525595,345 days 07:13:51.525595,346,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11wky2r/amazon_to_lay_off_9000_more_workers_after_earlier/

rt12le,stocks,A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year,"Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. 

I am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) 

Despite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. 

Meanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. 

But, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. 

There are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. 

I have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. 

One last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody ""buying the haystack"" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. 

In summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots.",2021-12-31 19:16:04,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525605,789 days 02:54:26.525606,520,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rt12le/a_message_to_all_of_you_who_earned_less_than_30/

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.

When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, ""It does not.""

Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. ""


What do you guys make of all this? Is everyone still permabullsih on Tesla or are the tides turning against them? Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.

v61iqo,stocks,High-Frequency Trading (HFT) explained - The war between man and machine that extracts $billions from the market,"**Intro**  

HFT uses custom-built machines to buy or sell the assets you want before you can - then sell you those same assets for a profit.  They are the potentially unnecessary middle-man charging a hidden tax by beating humans to the market.

**What's HFT?**  

HFT is a subset of algorithmic trading that specializes in scale and speed.  HFT can potentially execute 1000s of trades in the time it takes a human trader to blink. The fastest firms can reach speeds of sub-16 microseconds (16 millionths of a second) per trade. 

**Speed (Latency) Advantage**  

HFT exists to be first. Mostly it takes advantage of arbitrage (buying on one exchange and selling to another at a higher price).  It also detects orders placed by other traders taking a share of their profits by capitalizing on the market movement. 

**Pay for Speed**  

HFT firms spend millions to reduce latency, building infrastructures like cables and microwave towers.  Spread famously built a secret underground cable from New York to Chicago for $300 mil just to cut transfer speed by 3 milliseconds 

**Data or Nothing**  

HFT's algorithms are fed by info either from exchange price data feeds or more obscure sources. Without data, the machines don't know what to buy or sell.  Data is what makes HFT's speed valuable and HFT firms will do seemingly anything to get it. 

**Getting Data First** 

For HFT firms it's not enough to get the data, they need to get it and act on it before anyone else.  

[Reuters](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100809395) famously got caught selling access to the consumer confidence number to HFT firms minutes before public release. 

**Dark Pools**  

Dark Pools, exchanges owned by banks and hidden from the public, exist in theory to limit the impact of big orders on the market.  Some HFT firms get special access to data on trades happening inside, which they use to anticipate price movements on other exchanges. 

**Rebates**  

Rebates are incentives typically paid to a seller by an exchange to encourage liquidity.  HFT firms convinced some exchanges to pay buyers instead. This encourages traders to use these exchanges first giving HFT firms the tip of which assets to buy on other markets. 

**Regulation** 

In the US, brokers are required to buy stocks at the lowest market price - this is supposed to make markets fairer.  It also means HFT firms know where to look when another trader is looking to buy and they can use that information to beat them to the next market. 

**Pinging** 

If you want to know if people want to buy or sell you may need to do a little trading yourself.  HFT firms send small orders to exchanges. If they're filled instantly they infer bigger orders are coming & use their speed to get to the other markets first. 

**Quantity** 

Over Quality  HFT impact seems insignificant taking as little as 0.0005USD per-share profit. But multiplied by the millions of trades HFT can execute in a day the impact can be huge  In 2008, HFT made an estimated 8-20 billion USD net profit! 

**Hidden Tax or Necessary Evil?** 

Some argue HFT is essential to healthy liquidity in the market.  Others claim HFT skims money from transactions that likely would have happened anyway.  As with most things, the answer is probably somewhere in the middle. 

**Harmony**  

HFT machines will always have a speed advantage over their human counterparts.  But man and machine can co-exist. As long as we can find system solutions that remove informational advantages for HFT firms to skim the profits of regular traders.

1ar26eu,stocks,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

rchsvk,stocks,"THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS","From many news media outlets and youtuber finance experts and stock gurus, I keep seeing the notion that the stock market is heavily overvalued currently relative to its former valuation metrics that have held for decades. 

To be honest, this is true, and they're not wrong, but what they fail to take into account is that until interest rates go up and/or median home prices come down, for the VAST majority of Americans there are only the following ways of avoiding poverty: education (becoming less and less worth it for most degrees), fraud (risky AND makes you a piece of shit), literal gambling, poker (which I don't classify as gambling if you're highly skilled but is NOT easy to be consistently profitable), starting your own business / youtube / social media (risky if you go all in and not definitely for everyone), and investing in stocks (admirable, and dramatically easier than all of the above to be profitable). Investing in housing is a very viable way to make money, but when the median home price is $400,000 this is no longer accessible to the everyday American for younger generations as a means of building wealth (fuck boomers, they have literally written and enacted laws that benefit them and only them throughout their lives).

Until investing is no longer the ""easy"" and accessible way to succeed in life for the everyday American, the stock market is going to perpetually be ""overvalued"" by former metrics and dips will always have rapid recoveries.   


So when people and institutions say that the market is ""overvalued"" take this with a grain of salt and when the market reaches ""insane valuations"" rest assured you can ignore this until there is another more reliable means of ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO FUCKING RETIRE SOME DAY.",2021-12-09 13:35:27,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525648,811 days 08:35:03.525648,675,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rchsvk/the_stock_market_will_always_rebound_and_stay/

&#x200B;

\------the article------------------------------------------

(Bloomberg) -- Russia defaulted on its foreign-currency sovereign debt for the first time in a century, the culmination of ever-tougher Western sanctions that shut down payment routes to overseas creditors.  

For months, the country found paths around the penalties imposed after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. But at the end of the day on Sunday, the grace period on about $100 million of snared interest payments due May 27 expired, a deadline considered an event of default if missed.

With the final deadline passed, focus shifts to what investors do next.

They don’t need to act immediately, and may choose to monitor the progress of the war in the hope that sanctions are eventually softened. Time may be on their side: the claims only become void three years on from the payment date, according to the bond documents. 

“Most bondholders will keep the wait-and-see approach,” Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.

“It’s a very, very rare thing, where a government that otherwise has the means is forced by an external government into default,” said Hassan Malik, senior sovereign analyst at Loomis Sayles & Company LP. “It’s going to be one of the big watershed defaults in history.”

NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.

&#x200B;

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
>  
>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&#x200B;

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

&#x200B;

\---

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

&#x200B;

Revenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

&#x200B;

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon

qwo0q3,stocks,Alibaba misses expectations as earnings plunge 38% in the September quarter,"Alibaba missed revenue and earnings expectations for the September quarter, as slowing economic growth in China and the country’s crackdown on its technology companies weighed on results.  


Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal second-quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:   


Revenue: 200.69 billion yuan ($31.4 billion) vs. 204.93 billion yuan estimated, a 29% year-on-year rise.  
EPS: 11.20 yuan vs. 12.36 yuan estimated, a 38% year-on-year decline.  


Alibaba has been a victim of China’s crackdown on its domestic technology industry which has seen a slew of new regulation brought in from antitrust to data protection.  


While China’s tech giants have grown largely unencumbered over the past few years, Beijing has looked to clean up some of the behaviors of its corporates. Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion in April as part of an anti-monopoly probe.  


Meanwhile, China’s economy slowed down in the third quarter of the year.  


Expectations were low coming into the fiscal second-quarter earnings report as a result, with analysts expecting it to be one of the most challenging quarters ever for the Chinese e-commerce giant.  


The company is coming off the back of Singles Day, a huge shopping event in China where e-commerce platforms push heavy discounts and rack up billions of dollars of sales.  


Alibaba raked in gross merchandise volume during the 11-day period totaling 540.3 billion yuan ($84.54 billion). Any revenue Alibaba gets from this event will not be reflected in the September quarter.

Some Wall Street traders are betting that the Federal Reserve will take the most aggressive step in decades as it races to catch up with scorching-hot inflation.

The dismal report prompted some banks, including Barclays and Jeffries, to revise their expectations for the Fed meeting this week, which concludes on Wednesday. The strategists now expect central bankers to approve a 75-basis point hike as they try to project confidence to the markets.

""The U.S. central bank now has good reason to surprise markets by hiking more aggressively than expected in June,"" the Barclays strategists wrote in a note Friday. ""We realize it is a close call and that it could play out in either June or July. But we are changing our forecast to call for a 75-basis point hike on June 15."" 

Policymakers have not lifted the short-term interest rate by 75-basis points since 1994, and have not approved a 100-basis point increase since Paul Volcker led the central bank and ran an aggressive inflation-crushing campaign in the early 1980s.",2022-06-14 12:04:41,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525732,624 days 10:05:49.525732,664,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vc1yxp/markets_brace_for_100point_fed_rate_hike_as/

wrx7zi,stocks,I think I have learned my lesson,"During high school. I invested in tech stocks such as NIO, TSM and AMD. I did this with no margin and ended up with 100% return through the covid years. This gave me confidence to be more bold with my investments. After graduating I decided to dedicate more time to learn about stocks. I still stuck with 0% margins and still followed my standard procedure when doing due diligence. I evaluated a company’s balance sheets, determined whether a company is undervalued or overvalued as I moved away from tech stocks and allowed myself to dip into other industries. I believe I had became pretty good at it. I invested in companies like AUPH at $11 and cashed out most of my stocks at ~$25. I bought into NET at $50 which Im still holding and still green on. However, recently BBBY soared up to the 20s. I read what the redditors over at WSB were saying and decided to throw in 15% of my equity into a position at X5 margins into BBBY. Today, the stock has dipped so much that I believe I am going to have to pay off my BBBY position with other positions in my portfolio. 

I think I have learned a valuable lesson today.

ykcawl,stocks,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

vy22sy,stocks,USA Consumer Price Index for June 2022 year-on-year is 9.1%,"CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - JUNE 2022

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.3 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 1.0 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors. The energy index rose 7.5 percent over the month and contributed nearly half of the all items increase, with the gasoline index rising 11.2 percent and the other major component indexes also rising. The food index rose 1.0 percent in June, as did the food at home index.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in June, after increasing 0.6 percent in the preceding two months. While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, and new vehicles. The indexes for motor vehicle repair, apparel, household furnishings and operations, and recreation also increased in June. Among the few major component indexes to decline in June were lodging away from home and airline fares.

**The all items index increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981.** The all items less food and energy index rose 5.9 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 41.6 percent over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending April 1980. The food index increased 10.4 percent for the 12-months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1981.

smqkq9,stocks,Frontier and Spirit to merge creating fifth-largest airline in U.S. in $6.6 billion deal,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/frontier-and-spirit-to-merge-creating-5th-largest-airline-in-us.html

Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, the two largest low-cost carriers in the U.S. have agreed to merge in a deal valued at $6.6 billion, creating what would become the fifth-largest airline in the country.

The merger gives Denver-based Frontier Airlines a 51.5% controlling stake in the combined airline. Spirit investors will receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each share they own, giving Spirit shareholders an implied value of $25.83 per share, which is a 19% premium over the value of Spirit shares at the end of last week, the companies said.

“This transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our guests even better, expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure, resulting in more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public,” Ted Christie, president and CEO of Miramar, Fla.-based Spirit, said in a statement announcing the deal.

The boards of both companies approved the deal over the weekend.

Frontier Chairman Bill Franke will chair the combined company, which he said “will create America’s most competitive ultra-low fare airline for the benefit of consumers.”

The companies didn’t announce the new name of the combined carrier, the CEO or location of the airline’s headquarters. Those questions will be answered by a committee led by Franke after the transaction closes, which is expected in the second half of the year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

For Franke, the deal is the latest in a career of making investments in and overseeing low-fare airlines around the world, including Spirit. From 2006 through 2013, Indigo Partners held a stake in Spirit with Franke serving as chair of the airline before he resigned when Indigo sold its position in the carrier. Shortly after that move, Indigo bought Frontier Airlines from Republic Airways for $145 million

Since that acquisition, Denver-based Frontier has steadily expanded its route network with new destinations and additional flights, often targeting cities where larger airlines like Southwest have a strong presence. In almost every case, Frontier enters with low fares to gain a foothold with price-conscious travelers.

Spirit has also been aggressively expanding in the last decade and plans to continue that strategy once combined with Frontier.

In 2013, Spirit and Frontier had 2.8% of the revenue passenger miles flown by U.S. airlines, according to the Department of Transportation. By 2019, their combined market share had almost doubled to 5.4% while the four largest airlines in the U.S., American Airlines, Delta, United and Southwest, controlled 73.9% of revenue passenger miles

With both carriers flying only Airbus planes and neither dominating one particular market, a Spirit/Frontier merger makes sense on paper. Still, the Biden administration has made it clear to corporate America it will scrutinize potential mergers far more aggressively than the Trump administration.

In premarket trading Monday, Spirit shares jumped about 11% and Frontier Group stock fell about 3%.",2022-02-07 13:44:25,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525772,751 days 08:26:05.525772,467,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/smqkq9/frontier_and_spirit_to_merge_creating/

123sjrn,stocks,"Disney will start laying off employees this week, CEO Bob Iger says in memo","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/disney-layoffs-bob-iger-memo.html

Disney will begin layoffs this week, the first of three rounds before the beginning of the summer that result in about 7,000 job cuts, according to a memo sent by Chief Executive Bob Iger.

The cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce corporate spending and boost free cash flow. Disney said last month it plans to cut $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content spend.

“This week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the company’s workforce reductions,” Iger wrote in the memo, which was obtained by CNBC. “Leaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days. A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target.”

The layoffs were initially announced in February. The job cuts will be cross-company, hitting Disney’s media and distribution division, parks and resorts, and ESPN.

Disney is following the lead of Warner Bros. Discovery and other legacy media companies that are cutting jobs and spending. Disney has said its streaming business, led by Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, will stop losing money in 2024. Disney shares are up about 8% this year after falling 44% last year.

“We have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs as part of a strategic realignment of the company, including important cost-saving measures necessary for creating a more effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our business,” Iger wrote. “For our employees who aren’t impacted, I want to acknowledge that there will no doubt be challenges ahead as we continue building the structures and functions that will enable us to be successful moving forward.”

Since returning as CEO, Iger has reorganized the company and acknowledged that he’d consider selling Hulu. Disney will host its annual shareholder meeting April 3.

Read Iger’s full memo:

Dear Fellow Employees,

As I shared with you in February, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs as part of a strategic realignment of the company, including important cost-saving measures necessary for creating a more effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our business. Over the past few months, senior leaders have been working closely with HR to assess their operational needs, and I want to give you an update on those efforts.

This week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the company’s workforce reductions. Leaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days. A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target. 

The difficult reality of many colleagues and friends leaving Disney is not something we take lightly. This company is home to the most talented and dedicated employees in the world, and so many of you bring a lifelong passion for Disney to your work here. That’s part of what makes working at Disney so special. It also makes it all the more difficult to say goodbye to wonderful people we care about. I want to offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to every departing employee for your numerous contributions and your devotion to this beloved company. 

For our employees who aren’t impacted, I want to acknowledge that there will no doubt be challenges ahead as we continue building the structures and functions that will enable us to be successful moving forward. I ask for your continued understanding and collaboration during this time. 

In tough moments, we must always do what is required to ensure Disney can continue delivering exceptional entertainment to audiences and guests around the world – now, and long into the future. Please know that our HR partners and leaders are committed to creating a supportive and smooth process every step of the way.

I want to thank each of you again for all your many achievements here at The Walt Disney Company.

sjkieh,stocks,Why FB is investing so heavily into VR (if it isn't obvious by now),"They have no control over the OS right now. iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) can do whatever they want at the OS level.

Without control at the OS level. FB can't do the following:

* Create an app store and charge 30% for transactions like Apple and Google does
* Control its own destiny. Right now, Apple and Google control FB's destiny just as much as FB itself does. Ex: Apple deciding to take away app tracking. Android could do it eventually as well because Google now knows less tracking drives more advertisers to Google search.
* Market its own products and services over Apple and Google's. For example, Youtube is preinstalled on Android and Apple's app store ads compete with FB's.

FB is hellbent on having its own OS and controlling its own destiny in what they think is the next mass-market device: VR.

FB is early in the VR push. It's early because it wants a seat at the table when VR is mature. But being early is expensive and they're not guaranteed to beat Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or some Chinese/unknown company.

That's why FB is willing to lose $10b/year on VR. Do I think it's the right strategic decision? I don't know. Am I surprised that they're willing to lose $10b/year on VR? Not at all. Not one bit. I think Zuckerberg, with his full control, would drive Meta to bankruptcy before giving up on it.

**Additional commentary:**

While I think Zuckerberg truly believes in the ""metaverse"" future, I think the recent push into VR is somewhat fueled by the inability to innovate inside FB. Think about it. When was the last time FB launched a hit app? Whatsapp and Instagram were purchased. The best IG features were copied from Snap (Stories) and Tiktok (Reels). Besides the traditional social media apps, people are also spending more time on other networks like Reddit, Discord, Twitch, Clubhouse. FB can't innovate.

They've built a culture of optimization, not creation. Because of this, they can't make something to capture the attention of the younger generation. As we all know, each generation has its own set of social media apps because kids don't want to use the same social network as their parents. FB will eventually die out because of this lack of innovation. The ""metaverse"" is kind of like Zuckerberg's hail mary. If he can create a platform, he can be the Apple or Google by controlling the OS. He won't have to worry about a new cool app that steals users away from FB/IG/Whatsapp because that app will be on his own platform.

Let me ask you this: if TikTok was invented by Facebook, would they still go all in on the meta verse right now?

Disclaimer: I don't own any FB stocks. I actually dislike the company a lot and wouldn't buy their stocks out of principle. But it makes total logical sense to me why FB is investing so heavily into VR.",2022-02-03 14:26:46,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525805,755 days 07:43:44.525805,821,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/

qbxov2,stocks,Zillow pauses home buying — raising ‘red flags’ about the real-estate market,"Zillow’s unexpected announcement this week that it’s putting a temporary stop to its home-buying activities raised many analysts’ eyebrows. And some argue that more concerning trends could be on the way. The service, Zillow Offers, is what’s known as an “iBuyer” — it purchases and sells homes directly to consumers, typically renovating them in between. 

Following a report from Bloomberg, Zillow Z, +1.85% ZG, +3.98% confirmed that its Zillow Offers division would not be signing any additional new contracts to purchase homes through the end of 2021. In explaining the move, Zillow said the company was facing a backlog of renovations and dealing with operational-capacity issues. 

**Labor and material shortages-**

“We’re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy — inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,” Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow’s chief operating officer, said in the announcement. She added that the pause would enable the company “to focus on sellers already under contract” and the company’s existing inventory of homes. Other iBuyers have not followed suit, as of now. In fact, it’s just the opposite — most of Zillow’s competitors re-emphasized their expansion plans in response to the announcement.

y0j72b,stocks,‘This is serious’: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warns U.S. likely to tip into recession in 6 to 9 months,"* JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy was “actually still doing well” at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared to the 2008 global financial crisis when the world tips into recession.
* “But you can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future — and this is serious stuff,” Dimon told CNBC’s Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday.
* His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday warned that a “very, very serious” mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the U.S. and global economy into recession by the middle of next year.

Dimon, the chief executive of the largest bank in the U.S., said the U.S. economy was “actually still doing well” at present and consumers were likely to be in better shape compared to the 2008 global financial crisis.

“But you can’t talk about the economy without talking about stuff in the future — and this is serious stuff,” Dimon told CNBC’s Julianna Tatelbaum on Monday.

Among the indicators ringing alarm bells, Dimon cited the impact of runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative easing and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they’re likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,” Dimon said.

His comments come at a time of growing concern about the prospect of an economic recession as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks raise interest rates to combat soaring inflation.

Speaking to CNBC last month, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said he’s feeling apprehensive about the U.S. central bank going too far, too fast in its bid to tackle high inflation rates.

The Fed raised benchmark interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last month, the third consecutive increase of that size. Fed officials also indicated they would continue hiking rates well above the current range of 3% to 3.25%.

Dimon said that while the Fed “waited too long and did too little” as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, the central bank is “clearly catching up.”

“From here we let’s all wish him success and keep our fingers crossed that they managed to slow down the economy enough so that whatever it is, is mild — and it is possible,” he added.

**‘To guess is hard, be prepared’**

Dimon said he couldn’t be sure how long a recession in the U.S. might last, adding that market participants should assess a range of outcomes instead.

“It can go from very mild to quite hard and a lot will be reliant on what happens with this war. So, I think to guess is hard, be prepared.”

Dimon said the one guarantee he could be sure of was volatile markets. He also warned that this could coincide with disorderly financial conditions.

Asked for his views on the outlook for the S&P 500

, Dimon said the benchmark could yet fall by “another easy 20%” from current levels, adding that “the next 20% would be much more painful than the first.”

Speaking to a roomful of analysts and investors in early June, Dimon said he was preparing the bank for an economic “hurricane” caused by the Federal Reserve and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet,” Dimon said at the time. He advised investors to do the same.

Market participants are monitoring a highly anticipated inflation print on Thursday as well as a slew of corporate earnings.

JPMorgan is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Friday.

Shares of the bank are down roughly 33% year-to-date.

p6gk2y,stocks,Palantir Buys Gold Bars as Hedge Against ‘Black Swan Event’,">Palantir Technologies Inc. said it’s preparing for another “black swan event” by stockpiling gold bars and inviting customers to pay for its data analysis software in gold.

>The company spent $50.7 million this month on gold, part of an unusual investment strategy that also includes startups, blank-check companies and possibly [redacted]. Palantir had previously said it would accept [redacted] as a form of payment before adding precious metals more recently.

>A spokeswoman for Palantir said no one has yet paid in either [redacted] or gold. Accepting nontraditional currencies “reflects more of a worldview,” Shyam Sankar, the chief operating officer, said in an interview. “You have to be prepared for a future with more black swan events.”

>The gold purchase was buried in a securities filing last week for its quarterly financial results and reported earlier this week by Barron’s. The acceptance of gold as a form of payment hasn’t been previously reported.

>Palantir’s 100-ounce gold bars will be kept in a secure location in the northeastern U.S., according to the filing. “The company is able to take physical possession of the gold bars stored at the facility at any time with reasonable notice,” Palantir wrote.

>Palantir, co-founded by the technology billionaire Peter Thiel and Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp, makes software used by governments and businesses. It fashions itself as a company of free thinkers. Palantir relocated to Denver last year and mocked its peers in Silicon Valley on the way out. In the interview, Shyam compared Palantir’s culture with an “artist colony,” rather than a tech company churning out software on an assembly line.

>Governments have strongly embraced Palantir software to help them make sense of the coronavirus pandemic, the current so-called black swan, a random and unpredictable event.

>The company has some $2.3 billion in cash and is exploring creative uses for that money. Palantir said in May that it was considering investing in [redacted].

lcsiia,stocks,“Can’t lose money if I don’t sell” myth explained,"I want to welcome all the members who have joined over the past week. Many of you have come from wsb, and I am seeing multiple occasions where people have regretted the losses they took last week and have expressed a desire to learn investing fundamentals.

That’s great! I plan to put together a “fundamentals” guide at some point, but I have not yet had the chance. In the meantime, though, I want to point out the flawed reasoning behind a common sentiment over at wsb, one that may apply to some of our newcomers:

”Technically, if I don’t sell, I haven’t lost.”

The point people are trying to make is that you only *realize* a loss on a position if you sell your stock. For example, if I’ve purchased a stock at, say, $400, and now that stock is down to, I don’t know, $50, then *technically* I haven’t lost anything yet because I still own the share.

This is incorrect reasoning. To explain why, you have to consider the notion of **opportunity cost**, which is essentially the cost of *not* choosing an alternate option. So let’s say I have two investing options: option A and option B. Option A will pay me 12% return, option B will pay me 10% return. I went with option B. In this case, my opportunity cost is 2%, or the additional return I *would have* made by going with option A.

If we return to our example of the $400 stock that is now trading at $50, then sure, on the one hand, we have not sold our share and so we have not realized any actual loss. But that’s not the end of the story. You also have to account for the *opportunity cost* of holding on to a $50 asset when that $50  could otherwise be reinvested.

Say you hold your share and it stays at $50 for the remainder of the year (perhaps in the best case scenario). By holding, you not only have lost 87% thus far on the initial trade, but you’ve also cost yourself the potential gain of putting that $50 into a safe investment (like an index fund), which likely will have a modest 8% gain on the year. That 8% gain is the *opportunity cost* of holding.

In short, no, there **is** a cost even when you do not sell.

(This is not financial advice, I just want to explain a concept.)

\*\*\*

**Edit**: I’ve received lots of encouraging messages from people who really are interested in the fundamentals guide I mentioned above, and I will definitely put that together for you. I’ve also received some, uh, not so encouraging messages from people who assume I’m telling everyone to sell.

Let me clarify: as I’ve said elsewhere in the comments, the concept of opportunity cost does not necessarily mean that every position that is currently down should be sold. Why? Because if you can reasonably expect that your current position will have a better return than those alternative options, then there is no opportunity cost. If you are down 4%, but expect a bounce back and, eventually, a 12% return overall, then the 10% return on an alternative position does not present a cost to you.

If you expect your $50 stock to return to $1000+, then chances are that you won’t have any better opportunities available than a 150%+ return (assuming you bought at $400 and are currently at $50, then $400 is your break even point. $1000 would represent a 150% return on $400).

It is important, however, to consider the *likelihood* of each of these outcomes. That is, how likely is it that you’ll see a 1900% increase on your current position ($50 -> $1000) versus how likely is it that you’ll see an x% return on another opportunity? I’m not telling you what to think here, but that is the question everyone has to ask with every investment.

My purpose was merely to correct for the claim that there is no cost to holding at a loss. There is, assuming that other opportunities can reasonably be said to offer gains over and above what you can expect from your current position.",2021-02-04 22:48:33,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525835,1118 days 23:21:57.525835,552,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcsiia/cant_lose_money_if_i_dont_sell_myth_explained/
zlv66m,stocks,SEC charges social media influencers in alleged $100 million stock pump and dump scheme,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/sec-charges-social-media-influencers-in-alleged-100-million-fraud-scheme.html

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged seven social media influencers with using Twitter and Discord to commit securities fraud and an additional influencer with aiding and abetting the alleged $100 million scheme, the agency announced on Wednesday. The seven charged with securities fraud used the social media platforms to manipulate exchange-traded stocks in a scheme going back to at least January 2020, the SEC alleged. Through widely-followed Twitter accounts and stock trading chatrooms on Discord, the defendants allegedly “promoted themselves as successful traders,” according to an SEC press release and allegedly encouraged followers to buy stocks that they also purchased.

But they did not disclose to their followers while promoting those stocks that they allegedly planned to later sell shares once prices or trading volumes rose, according to the complaint. The influencers allegedly gained a profit by pumping the stock prices and then selling once they rose, earning about $100 million in total, the SEC claims. The eight also face criminal charges from the Department of Justice’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas. Each of the defendants had well over 100,000 Twitter followers as of this month, the complaint states. One of those accounts, @PJ_Matlock, run by Texas resident Perry Matlock who calls himself the CEO of Atlas Trading, no longer exists as of Wednesday. The other primary defendants accused of securities fraud (and their Twitter handles) are Edward Constantin (@MrZackMorris), Thomas Cooperman (@ohheytommy), Gary Deel (@notoriousalerts), Mitchell Hennessey (@Hugh_Henne), Stefan Hrvatin (@LadeBackk) and John Rybarcyzk (@Ultra_Calls). Daniel Knight (@DipDeity) was charged with aiding and abetting the alleged scheme, in part by co-hosting a podcast that promoted some of the primary defendants as expert traders. The SEC alleged Knight also traded with the other defendants and saw profits from the scheme.

Some of the defendants’ Twitter bios include disclaimers at least as of Wednesday that appear to try to mitigate their legal risks. For example, Constantin’s account says “All my tweets are just my opinions. I’m still not a financial advisor. Parody account.” Hennessey’s says, “Everything is my opinion.I actively trade positions.Not a pro,Not Financial Advice,probably do the opposite.” Rybarcyzk’s reads “DISCLAIMER: My tweets are NOT recommendations to enter a stock. - Ideas shared on Twitter are NOT buy or sell signals. DO NOT TRADE BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA.” Knight’s bio says, “don’t buy/sell off my tweets EVER.”",2022-12-14 16:19:31,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525839,441 days 05:50:59.525839,290,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlv66m/sec_charges_social_media_influencers_in_alleged/
w9lks6,stocks,Fed hikes interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.

In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.

While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.

Markets largely expected the move after Fed officials telegraphed the increase in a series of statements since the June meeting. Central bankers have emphasized the importance of bringing down inflation even if it means slowing the economy.

In its post-meeting statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cautioned that “recent indicators of spending and production have softened.”

“Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,” the committee added, using language similar to the June statement. Officials against described inflation as “elevated” and ascribed the situation to supply chain issues and higher prices for food and energy along with “broader price pressures.“

The rate hike was approved unanimously. In June, Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented, advocating a slower course with a half percentage point increase.

The increases come in a year that began with rates floating around zero but which has seen a commonly cited inflation measure run at 9.1% annually. The Fed aims for inflation around 2%, though it adjusted that goal in 2020 to allow it to run a bit hotter in the interest of full and inclusive employment.

In June, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, close to full employment. But inflation, even by the Fed’s standard of core personal consumption expenditures, which was at 4.7% in May, is well off target.

The efforts to bring down inflation are not without risks.

The U.S. economy is teetering on a recession as inflation slows consumer purchases and dents business activity.

First-quarter GDP declined by 1.6% annualized, and markets were bracing for a reading on the second quarter to be released Thursday that could show consecutive declines, a widely used barometer for a recession. The Dow Jones estimate for Thursday’s reading is 0.3%.

Along with rate increases, the Fed is reducing the size of asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Beginning, in June, the Fed began allowing some of the proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off.

The balance sheet has declined just $16 billion since the beginning of the roll-off, though the Fed set a cap of up to $47.5 billion that potentially could have been wound down. The cap will rise through the summer, eventually hitting $95 billion a month by September. The process is known in markets as “quantitative tightening” and is another mechanism the Fed uses to impact financial conditions.

Along with the accelerated balance sheet runoff, markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least another half percentage point in September. Traders Wednesday afternoon were assigning about a 53% chance the central bank would go even further, with a third straight 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, increase in September, according to CME Group data.

The FOMC does not meet in August, instead gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for its annual retreat.

Markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates by next summer, even though committee projections released in June show now cuts until at least 2024.

Multiple officials have said they expect to hike aggressively through September then assess what impact the moves were having on inflation. Despite the 1.5 percentage point increases between March and June, the June consumer price index reading was the highest since November 1981, with the rent index at its highest level since April 1986 and dental care costs hitting a record in a data series going back to 1995.

The central bank has faced critics, both for being too slow to tighten when inflation first started to accelerate in 2021, and for possibly going too far and causing a more severe economic downturn.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told CNBC on Wednesday that she worried the Fed hikes would pose economic danger to those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum by raising unemployment.",2022-07-27 18:03:47,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525843,581 days 04:06:43.525843,507,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9lks6/fed_hikes_interest_rates_by_075_percentage_point/

knqco3,stocks,Tesla Short Sellers Lost $38 Billion in 2020 as Stock Surged,"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-shorts-sellers-lost-38-billion-in-2020-as-stock-surged

With shares up 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.

Many of Tesla’s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

The next potential catalyst comes in early January, when Tesla reports fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery figures. Tesla expects to deliver half a million cars in 2020, a huge milestone for a company that initially struggled to mass-produce its Model 3 and is now building additional factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas.

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for shelter, gasoline, and food being the largest contributors. After declining in April, the energy index rose 3.9 percent over the month with the gasoline index rising 4.1 percent and the other major component indexes also increasing. The food index rose 1.2 percent in May as the food at home index increased 1.4 percent.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in May, the same increase as in April. While almost all major components increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, airline fares, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles. The indexes for medical care, household furnishings and operations, recreation, and apparel also increased in May.

**The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981**. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.0 percent over the last 12 months.

108b31n,stocks,Microsoft reportedly plans to invest $10 billion in creator of buzzy A.I. tool ChatGPT,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html

Microsoft plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup behind popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, according to a report from Semafor.

The deal is part of a funding round with other investors involved that would value OpenAI at a whopping $29 billion, Semafor reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It isn't clear whether the deal has been finalized but term sheets sent to prospective investors indicated the plan was to close the deal by the end of 2022, Semafor reported.

Microsoft will reportedly get a 75% share of OpenAI's profits until it makes back the money on its investment, after which the company would assume a 49% stake in OpenAI.

Microsoft and OpenAI were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

For several weeks, the tech world has been abuzz with chatter about ChatGPT. The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.

The AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.

A bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google. The company's Bing browser has only a small share of the global search engine market, however it is hoped the deal could help the firm chip away at Google's dominance by offering more advanced search capabilities.

In December, Morgan Stanley published a report examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share ""and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.""

OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November. Despite optimism over its potential, the project is burning through cash due to the overwhelming level of pressure on its servers arising from its virality. Five days after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Altman said that the chat research tool crossed 1 million users.",2023-01-10 14:25:27,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525863,414 days 07:45:03.525863,422,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/108b31n/microsoft_reportedly_plans_to_invest_10_billion/

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",2020-12-20 23:00:55,2024-02-28 22:10:30.525877,1164 days 23:09:35.525877,716,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kh4giq/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

j21rk1,stocks,Investing in ETFs,"A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that.  Several people suggested that it be ""pinned.""  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

ryakgb,stocks,Hedge funds are selling tech shares at their fastest pace in a decade,"Surging bond yields have triggered hedge funds to sell growth-focused technology shares at a speed not seen in the past decade. The hedge fund community dumped tech stocks in the four sessions between Dec. 30 and Tuesday as interest rates spiked. The four-session tech unloading marked the biggest sale in dollar terms in more than 10 years, reaching a record since Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage started tracking the data.

Tech stocks are seen as sensitive to rising yields because increased debt costs can hinder their growth and can make their future cash flows appear less valuable. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has sold off more than 3% this week, underperforming the S&P 500, which dipped 1% during the same period. The rate spike in the new year resumed Thursday, with investors assessing the Federal Reserve’s faster-than-expected policy tightening. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 1.75% during the session, rising for a fourth straight day. The benchmark rate ended 2021 at 1.51%.

Yields jumped after the Fed issued on Wednesday minutes from its last meeting, which showed the central bank could become even more aggressive than expected about raising interest rates and tightening policy. Goldman noted that hedge funds’ selling of tech stocks is driven almost entirely by long sales, in contrast to mainly short sales seen in the last two months of 2021.

x1fjlg,stocks,I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021 -** their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these - only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.

* **Percent Up Since Rec: 20%**
* **Avg Return of Rec: -8.8%**
* **SPY Return: -10.3% as of time I drafted**

&#x200B;

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. 

&#x200B;

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%
2. Redacted by mods: +7%

6. Inspire Medical Systems: +14%
7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

&#x200B;

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

gx8hhk,stocks,A philosophy for the new (young) investor,"""Why did I not buy x in March, I could have a 250% return right now""
""Damn, I should've poured my entire fucking life savings into $BITCH when I saw that DD post on it a week ago""
""I should've just held, sold way too early and now it's up $3""
Been seeing a lot of posts along the lines of these statements for the past few weeks.  The volatility of the market bestowing random lotto wins upon a handful of risk takers, who then proceed to (justifiably) claim bragging rights along with their newfound cash isn't helping the issue.  People will, of course, daydream themselves into a similar scenario, and the likelihood of a large, UNeducated gamble increases with each ""missed"" opportunity perceived.  

For those of you who are in your university years or a little past, we're looking at most likely a baseline hourly wage of $12.50 (CA assumption).  This is what you'd be standing on your feet for 8 hours a day to earn, a daily intake of roughly $80 after taxes, all the while dealing with the dumb shit that presents itself in every entry level position.  

Did your trade today result in a profit greater than $80?  Congratulations, you have no cause to be regretful.  Did your profit for the week average out to greater than $400?  Nice, you just made a week's salary without enduring the arduous process of punching in a time card every day.  Maybe you made double, triple that, quadruple, or even 10 times that in the span of a week or less.  You should be ecstatic; you just earned several months' paychecks in a fraction of the time and with a sliver of the work.  Maybe you have an actual job on top of this windfall; now you've doubled your financial stability (or more) and that out of state trip with your friends is no longer unrealistic. Of course within the lens of Reddit's investing discourse, taking away 1 to 4 grand when your play could have, if left alone, increased to 15 or 20 grand, might make you feel a bit empty for a while.  But outside of this context and in the world of wage workers, securing that much in such a short time span is so ridiculously fortunate; several of my university acquaintances slave terrible hours for minimum wage to make tuition or rent payments, and it would take them months to assemble what you and I may consider, in all our eagerness, a ""small"" profit. A trade that, in our view, was pulled too early would be enough to make them speechless.

Maybe the stock or contract climbs after you sell.  So long as you beat your working average, consider it a win.  Don't think ""what if"".  Just count your cash.

Edit: Thanks for the award! 🌵

Edit 2: Thanks for the kind words. Never expected a response of this magnitude when typing my thoughts out.

r78jjn,stocks,"The omicron panic is overdone. Buy the dips in these stocks, says JPMorgan","“Over the last several days markets have been in turmoil over the new COVID variant omicron. However, data on omicron is sparse, information contradictory, and some media has been exaggerating risks and highlighting worst case scenarios,” chief global strategist Marko Kolanovic and quant strategist Bram Kaplan wrote in a note to clients. They pointed fingers at a “media blitz” on Thanksgiving evening, one of the lowest market liquidity points in a year, that sent growth-sensitive assets crashing. They took issue with a selloff sparked by Moderna’s CEO, who dashed hopes that current vaccines will work against omicron. They argued his comments have been “invalidated by reports from Pfizer, Oxford, the WHO and the Israeli Health Ministry.”

Kolanovic and Kaplan said their clients are less worried about the variant and more about flight restrictions, which have included barring South African flights, but not European ones, where cases have also been spotted. They described assessments of omicron’s potential transmissibility as confusing at best. “In simple terms, when older variants are spreading via breakthrough infections, new variants will always appear to be significantly more transmissible than older ones.” They backed this up with a tweet by biomathemetician Gabriela Gomes.

Early reports suggest it may be less deadly, and if confirmed in coming weeks, that could turn omicron into a positive for markets, said the pair. Kolanovic and Kaplan raised the possibility that a less severe and more contagious variant may crowd out more severe variants, potentially speeding up the end of the pandemic and turning it into more of a seasonal flu. That’s amid vaccines and a growing list of treatments to tackle COVID, said the strategists. “If the market were to anticipate that scenario — omicron could be a catalyst for steepening (not flattening) the yield curve, rotation from growth to value, selloff in COVID and lockdown beneficiaries and rally in reopening themes,” said the team.

“Also, if that scenario were to happen, instead of skipping two letters and naming it omicron, the WHO could have skipped all the way to omega. As such, we view the recent selloff in these segments as an opportunity to buy the dip in cyclicals, commodities and reopening themes, and to position for higher bond yields and steepening,” said the bank’s strategists. Here’s hoping they’re right.

 **The buzz** 

Apple AAPL, -0.32% has reportedly warned suppliers that demand may be softer into 2022. Wedbush analysts lifted shares to $200 from $185, on optimism headed into 2022. They also see the “tech stalwart” as a “safety blanket” in a near-term COVID market storm. 

GlaxoSmithKline GSK, 0.03% GSK, +0.61% says its COVID-19 Sotrovimab antibody treatment is effective against the omicron variant, but based on lab test tubes. The U.S. has unveiled its plan for stricter COVID-19 testing on international travelers.

WeWork shares WE, -2.65% are down after the co-working space group said it will restate financials and admitted a material weakness.

Meanwhile, infections in South Africa, which raised the alarm over the variant last week, were at 8,561 on Wednesday, doubling in 24 hours. A top scientist in South Africa has warned that “more severe complications may not present themselves for a few weeks.”

loffqz,stocks,A bug in Schwab caused my retirement account to go naked short GME.,"This is a story that \*involves\* GME, but it is not \*about\* GME.

The events I'm describing here happened on January 28 in my cash retirement account.

In short, I had some GME shares, and used the interface to sell them immediately after I read that Robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button. A few minutes later, it did not appear to work, so I attempted to sell again. Subsequently, my account showed that both ""sells"" went through. Then my account had the cash from both sales, and a negative balance of shares that I was required to deliver in 3 days.

After seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing (without limit), I freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss (\~$180k). If I was lucky and the price went down, I could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain, and could have kept my mouth shut (not that I would have). But instead I'm out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug, and Schwab owes me about $180k.

Had I not covered this erroneous short position, the shorts probably would have become what we know to be ""Failures to Deliver"".

I have attached the record of what happened below, which I sent to Schwab soon after the event, to try to get the situation undone. I eventually was able to call their support team and they said I would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation.

The guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug, in other equities too. I can't recall the complete conversation.

Anyway, I recently got a message in the system that I would have to wait \*another\* 30 days. So I flipped my shit and now I'm posting about it here. Please don't comment about how retarded I am for investing my retirement in GME. That's not the story. I do what I want, I like the stock, and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded I am, and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on.

I have no information about how many other naked short positions were created by Schwab. I do know that it was more than just myself, and in other equities as well, based on my conversation with their support representative. I have no information about whether or not the bug still exists. I did not test it beyond what happened. It may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem, as far as I know.

Related: I recently posted something that made me suspicious to /r/stocks \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i\_strongly\_suspect\_that\_schwabameritrade\_does\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/)

I didn't realize this until today, but I connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my Schwab retirement account. i.e. Schwab+TD are the same company, and these two things could be related.

Here is the message I sent to Schwab (for a record of what happened). You might notice that it's a 401(k), which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading, but it is a self-managed fund, and individual stocks are actually allowed:

\------------------------------- START OF MESSAGE -----------------------------------

To whom it may concern:

My name is ####### #######, my account number is ####-####

I attempted to call your 1-800 number several times, but I was unable to get through to your support. Here is a breakdown of what happened:

There is a bug in your system that caused my non-margin account to briefly become short GME shares. My account is a non-margin 401(k) account. In good faith, I spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into. Two trades need to be undone.

At market open, my position this morning was NNNN shares of GME.

At 11:09, I attempted to place a market order to sell NNNN shares: Order #AAAAAAAA

The order did not show up for about 10 minutes. My account balance still showed NNNN shares, so I attempted to make a similar order again. I placed a sell of ""Limit Or Better"" to sell NNNN shares at $125. Order #BBBBBBBB

About 10 minutes later, I got confirmations for BOTH ORDERS, and a notice that the account was due securities. I DO NOT have a margin account, and it should not have gone short, the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account.

Once I realized what the system did, I saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in, and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account, I did a market buy at 11:44AM for NNNN shares using the ""Buy to Cover"" button, which zeroed out my position in GME. Order #CCCCCCCC

The erroneous trade needs to be undone, and my buy to cover also needs to be undone, as both of these are not legal trades for my 401(k).

Orders #BBBBBBBB and #CCCCCCCC should not exist on my account. #BBBBBBBB is a result of a bug in your trading system, and #CCCCCCCC  was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem.

I'm sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened, and I will refer to it when I call again when your call volume is reduced.

\-------------------------------------------- END OF MESSAGE -------------------------------------

Disclosure: My current positions in my 401(k) are as follows, ignoring what Schwab owes me:

GME: \~4500 shares

Cash & Money Market: \~$180k.

Again please don't comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies. None of this is advice. If you do anything related to what I'm talking about here, you're probably stupid. I'm only trying to point out a massive problem with Schwab that indicates to me a potential systemic risk in the markets (and Schwab investors).",2021-02-20 20:05:47,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588381,1103 days 02:04:45.588382,431,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/

* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.
* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

* Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.
* The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company and the reason for them publicly traded is because of **risk**. Sailing all over the planet was too risky for any company during that time. Ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate all that risk.
* Early stock trading happened at **Coffee shops,** and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops.
* It was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day, and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail. And because of that a bubble was burst and the government of England banned the issuing of shares until 1825.
* And despite ban of issuing shares, **London Stock Exchange** was established in 1801, it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares.
* And in 1817, **New York stock exchange** was established and it started trading since its very first day.

rtdpr6,stocks,Student loans might cause the next crash,"I have changed my opinon on this post and have made a [new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ruaoux/student_loans_will_not_cause_the_next_crash/)

TL;DR: Student loans are getting out of control and the average American is struggling to pay back. Once Biden's student loan pause stops the debt market might spiral out of control.

Okay ill make my thesis pretty clear from the start:Americans aren't able to pay their student loans back.

A pretty simple thesis right? In my opinion, yes, it's a lot simpler than mortgages.

The subprime mortgage crash of 2008 was caused by, in short terms, people not being able to afford paying their mortgages after their teaser rates expired.Theres a myriad of other ways to explain it and  thats just what I think. People were getting loans they obviously couldn't pay.They ignored the rates in the long term because they were being blinded with the misconceptions that they could always refinance their terms. This was obviously wrong, but the issuers didn't give a shit, because it made them rich. So they kept on dishing out loans to people even with shitty credit scores.

This time however Americas debt problems have taken a different turn. The student loan market is very different from the mortgage market. Obviously the market is smaller, but student loans are still the second largest consumer debt with a market of 1.6 trillion USD. The crazy thing is that the average debt incurred by students to fund their seminary education is $33,000. While the student loans cause less debt than mortgages they also often have worse terms. Issuers tend to focus on the principal amount owed while ignoring the interest that accumulates. This can really mess some people up when  in their later years of college they realise that they might need to take an extra semester to pass. Student debt can also set a stopper on getting a mortgage. If you spend say 10 or 15% on your student debt, getting a mortgage where you pay say 35% can be impossible. Student debt is also harder to refinance as fewer private issuers include refinancing in their terms, and with federal loans it forfeits key consumer protections.If you go bankrupt you cant discharge your loan without proving that your issuer is causing you ""undue hardship"". In mortgages all of these things are much easier to do and the debt market is obviously much more regulated.

So far I have only talked about how student loans are rigged against the average American. However one of the most pressing issues are the unjust rising costs of college. Ill let this chart speak for itself: [https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg](https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg)

Biden recently extended the Student debt forgiveness act. This is obviously bearish. This can be compared to the teaser rates running out and people not being able to afford their payments. As people haven't had to pay student loans in a while now, it is fair to say the part of their income that went to student debt has gone to other things. Maybe restaurants, maybe a new car with more debt etc... This basically means that people are going to be struggling to find money to repay their loans with.

So, how can we profit off of this? I would say credit default swaps. However i dont really know the credit derivatives market well and maybe someone in the comments has a better idea?

I dont really know how this is going to play out on the markets. But its going to be interesting.

Cathie Wood stepped up selling of social media platform Twitter Inc. shares days before its earnings. 

Wood’s firm ARK Investment Management LLC sold nearly 4 million Twitter shares on Monday, the most in one day since at least May, according to trading data from ARK compiled by Bloomberg. The social-media company is set to announce its earnings on Thursday.

Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF dumped 3.66 million shares of Twitter on Monday, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold more than 280,000 shares, according to the asset manager’s daily trading updates. That amounted to about $142 million based on Monday’s closing level. 

The selling comes amid a mixed set of results from its social-media peers. Facebook’s parent Meta Platforms Inc. suffered biggest one-day crash in stock-market history last week as its user base stopped growing while Snap Inc. jumped most ever after giving a quarterly sales forecast that topped Wall Street’s projections.  

ARK has been selling Twitter shares almost every week since late December and its sales have picked up pace this month. Apart from Monday, ARK sold more than 2 million shares of Twitter on Feb. 3 and more than 700,000 shares on Feb. 2.

The firm’s daily trading updates show only active decisions by the management team and do not include creation or redemption activity caused by investor flows. Wood’s oft-repeated mantra is that ARK invests with at least a five-year time horizon, and that volatility in their equity picks is expected.

xwbgwl,stocks,OPEC+ Agrees to Biggest Oil Production Cut Since Start of Pandemic - 2 Million Barrels Per Day,"VIENNA—The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies on Wednesday agreed to slash two million barrels a day, delegates said, in a move likely to push up already-high global energy prices and help oil-exporting Russia pay for its war in Ukraine.

The decision could undermine a plan by the Group of Seven wealthy nations to [cap the price of Russian oil](https://www.wsj.com/articles/g-7-rolls-out-plan-to-cap-price-of-russian-oil-11662124852?mod=article_inline) on the global market, a key part of the [West’s economic battle with Moscow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-oil-producers-stay-one-step-ahead-of-sanctions-11654076614?mod=article_inline). It came less than three months after President Biden visited Saudi Arabia, the OPEC’s de facto leader, in a bid to repair relations between the world’s biggest oil consumer and its biggest crude-oil exporter during a period of rising inflation driven in part by high energy prices.

The oil-production cut is the biggest from the group collectively known as OPEC+ since April 2020, signaling its intent to keep prices high after enduring seven years of a relatively subdued market, oil-industry analysts said.

After surging above $100 a barrel in the first six months of the year over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, oil prices have fallen 32% over the past four months on [global economic worries](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sharp-slowdown-in-global-trade-points-to-possible-recession-lower-inflation-11664964002?mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=article_inline), with international benchmark Brent crude dropping below $83 a barrel for the first time since January. Brent rose 0.6% to $92.38 on Wednesday, after having risen steadily on expectations of a production cut in recent days.

12ekzkx,stocks,Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y.",2023-04-07 13:15:37,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588397,327 days 08:54:55.588397,863,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ekzkx/tesla_cuts_us_prices_for_fifth_time_since_january/
yq5y61,stocks,Elon Musk sells 19.5 million Tesla shares worth almost $4 billion,"Source: https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/elon-musk-sells-19-5-million-tesla-shares-worth-almost-4-billion/  
  
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is selling millions of Tesla shares again. The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.

In April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.

Musk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.

Tesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.

15b4qg7,stocks,Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.

Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.

In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.

Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.

Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.

The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.

“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”

Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.

Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.

At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.

Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.

Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.

Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.

Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.

Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.

Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.

Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.

Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.

Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”

Failed tests and false advertising

Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.

One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.

The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.

The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.

Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”

EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.

Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.

Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.

Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.


 A screengrab from Tesla’s website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers.
Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.

EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.

The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.

The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.

Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.

“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”

Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.

Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.

Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.

Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”

South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.

The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.

Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”

Creating a diversion

By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.

As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.

Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”

Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.

Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.

If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.

Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.


Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.

The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.

In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.

Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.

Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.

The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.

By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.

Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.

Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”

“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.

“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”

The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.

Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”

After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.

“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”",2023-07-27 15:23:23,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588411,216 days 06:47:09.588411,491,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15b4qg7/source_tesla_rigged_the_dashboard_to_overstate/
zcaln8,stocks,Congress poised to pass marijuana banking reform in lame duck,"The Senate appears to have reached bipartisan consensus on the SAFE banking act, a bill that would open the federal banking and financial system to marijuana businesses that operate legally according to their state's law.

[The Senate plans to attach this marijuana legislation to one of the year end ""must-pass"" bills, such as the NDAA.](https://www.axios.com/2022/12/03/senate-marijuana-legislation-chuck-schumer)

Some additional notes:

1) The SAFE banking act has passed the house 6 times but has always died in the Senate. The most recent attempt last year was killed by progressives in the Senate who view the SAFE banking act as an easy win for investors/bankers while not doing much for those impacted by the war on drugs. A deal has been reached to include the HOPE act along with SAFE, which provides federal funding for states to expunge prior cannabis offenses, appeasing the demands of the progressives.

2) The NDAA is expected to be voted on this week, meaning we should see some major headlines regarding this cannabis legislation as soon as Monday.

What does this mean for cannabis stocks?

1) Aside from the news catalyst itself, the SAFE banking act should have a material impact on the financials of many of these cannabis companies. The language of the final version of SAFE is still unknown, but the core of the bill has always been to provide safe harbor for financial institutions to work with cannabis companies that are operating legally within their state. At the bare minimum, this will open the capital lending market to these companies, enabling them to get better terms on debt.

2) This will also provide safe harbor for hedge funds or other large institutions that may be interested in investing in the space but are unable to for compliance reasons. 

3) Finally, the US cannabis companies (MSOs) cannot currently trade on the major US stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ. There is some back and forth as to whether SAFE will allow these stocks to finally uplist, given that these are financial depository institutions. Many believe that yes, SAFE will allow these companies to uplist at least on the TSX (Toronoto Stock Exchange) and likely even the NASDAQ/NYSE, and there could even be special language added to the final bill to specify this.

13rxgz6,stocks,Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

Burger chain McDonald’s is temporarily closing its U.S. offices this week as it prepares to inform corporate employees about its layoffs as part of a broader company restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

In an internal email last week to U.S. employees and some international staff, McDonald’s asked them to work from home from Monday through Wednesday so it can deliver staffing decisions virtually, the report said. It is unclear how many employees will be laid off.

“During the week of April 3, we will communicate key decisions related to roles and staffing levels across the organization,” the Chicago-based company said in the message viewed by the Journal.

McDonald’s also asked employees to cancel all in-person meetings with vendors and other outside parties at its headquarters, the report added.

McDonald’s did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The fast-food chain said in January that it would review corporate staffing levels as part of an updated business strategy, which could lead to layoffs in some areas and expansion in others.

McDonald’s is expected to begin announcing key decisions by Monday.",2023-04-03 01:41:03,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588414,331 days 20:29:29.588414,667,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12a5kcz/mcdonalds_reportedly_temporarily_shuts_its_us/
yc85k4,stocks,"Jeremy Siegel: ""I think we're gonna have the second-biggest housing price decline since post WWII period over the next 12 months."" Agree?","# Worse than 2008?  Do you agree with Professor Siegel?  Where do you see U.S. real estate prices heading in the next 12-18 months?

Some other expert opinions including Professor Siegel:

# Jeremy Siegel, Wharton professor of finance

""I expect housing prices fall 10% to 15%, and the housing prices are accelerating on the downside,"" Siegel told CNBC in a recent interview, noting that housing prices by any indicator are going down.

In a separate interview with CNBC, he said: ""I think we're gonna have the second-biggest housing price decline since post WWII period over the next 12 months. That's a very, very significant factor for wealth \[and\] for equity in the housing market.""

# Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics

""Buckle in. Assuming rates remain near their current 6.5% and the economy skirts recession, then national house prices will fall almost 10% peak-to-trough,"" he said in a recent tweet. ""Most of those declines will happen sooner rather than later. And house prices will fall 20% if there is a typical recession.""

In a recent housing report, he said: ""The housing market is the most interest-rate-sensitive sector of the economy. It's on the front lines of the fallout from the Fed's efforts to bring down inflation.""

""There's going to be a coast-to-coast downturn in the housing market. It's going to be brutal. No part of the market is immune.""

# David Rosenberg, veteran economist and Rosenberg Research chief

""We have a massive housing bubble right now. Most of the household balance sheet is residential real estate, and it is equities,"" Rosenberg said in a RealVision interview released this week.

The economist pointed to the Fed's tightening efforts to bring inflation down from recent rates of 8-9% to its 2% target.

""They want the stock market to go down. They want home prices to go down. Why? Because there's not a snowball's chance in hell they're going to get to their 2% holy grail consumer inflation, without there being a period now of asset deflation. It is 100% necessary.""

# Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist

The veteran economist agrees there's a severe downturn coming — but he expects it will be a while before higher rates really hit home prices and demand. 

""The Fed's rate hikes have indeed led to a sharp fall in applications for building permits. However, construction employment hasn't yet even begun to decline, presumably because many workers are still busy finishing houses started when rates were lower,"" he said in a recent comment piece.

""And the wider economic effects of the coming housing slump are still many months away,"" he said. 

# Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics

Shepherdson believes the steep drop in home sales hasn't hit bottom yet, and even buyers who set their sights lower to cheaper houses will still face bigger mortgage payments.

""We expect a drop of 15-to-20% over the next year, in order to restore the pre-COVID price-to-income ratio,"" the strategist said in a note last week. 

""In short, housing is in free-fall. So far, most of the hit is in sales volumes, but prices are now falling too, and they have a long way to go.""

# Don Peebles, real estate developer and Peebles Corp. CEO

""I think the housing market is on its way into a recession. We're going to see price declines — price declines have already begun to take place,"" Peebles told Fox News last week.

""I look at this as though we have this freight train out of control, speeding up, speeding up with low interest rates, and no one looked to start slowing it down or stepping on the brakes. Now all of a sudden its going to come crashing into the station,"" he said. 

# Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real estate brokerage Redfin

""The housing market is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Chao said last week, alongside a report that found a record 22% of homes for sale had a price drop in September.

""With inflation still rampant, the Federal Reserve will likely continue hiking interest rates. That means we may not see high mortgage rates — the primary killer of housing demand — decline until early to mid-2023.""

So you hopefully can see, it's completely idiotic to come up with a strategy based on what the media says as the opinions are all over the map. 

My strategy for 23 is to ignore the noise, and be confident in building my long positions through a DCA strategy as I am still a long ways from retirement. That way I'll be dripping money in the market the whole year, so that if we are not close to the bottom now, ill still have buying power when things get really ""bad"" (Aka discounted).

pjng0j,stocks,"Elon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share ‘if they execute really well’","Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share “if they execute really well.” The CEO has often commented on Tesla’s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. 

In 2020, when Tesla’s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was “too high”. It sent Tesla’s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Our estimate for Tesla’s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,” In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That’s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark’s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: “If we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.” A $3,000 share price would put Tesla’s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrek’s Take

Since Ark’s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk’s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla’s stock price. He believes that “if executed really well”, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

I’d like to start off by saying I’m invested in some fairly safe picks (ETFs, AAPL, MSFT, etc) so I’m not worried when I see that the market is red or that my portfolio is down. That being said, on weekends when there is no market movement, I feel like I’m missing a whole part of my life. I really enjoy checking my portfolio and watching the movement throughout my day, whether it be up, down, or sideways. I’ve even started to dread the weekends because it’s less fun looking through tickers and seeing what stocks are mooning/plummeting. Anyone else feel the same way? How do you cope?

Edit 2: To address a common comment: yes, I do other things outside of sitting at my computer looking at tickers. I have other hobbies and people to talk to. That being said, investing is fun (which it should be!) and I miss it during the weekends. I'm lacking someone that brings me enjoyment when the market is closed.

vj4360,stocks,Netflix lays off 300 more employees as revenue growth slows,"Netflix is laying off around 300 more employees across the company.

The cuts, which represent about 3% of total employees, come about a month after the streaming company eliminated about 150 positions in the wake of its first subscriber loss in a decade.

“Today we sadly let go of around 300 employees,” Netflix said in a statement Thursday. “While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth. We are so grateful for everything they have done for Netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition.”

Netflix had warned investors in April that it would be pulling back on some of its spending growth over the next two years.

Spencer Neumann, the company’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call that Netflix is trying to be “prudent” about pulling back to to reflect the realities of its business. The company still plans to invest heavily, including around $17 billion on content.

Co-CEO Reed Hastings also said during the call that the company is exploring lower-priced, ad-supported tiers in a bid to bring in new subscribers after years of resisting advertisements on the platform.

Netflix is working to crack down on rampant password sharing as well. The company said that in addition to its 222 million paying households, more than 100 million households use its service through account sharing.

Shares of the company were down less than a percent during midday trading Thursday, but are down more around 70% since January.

oibdub,stocks,"Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism","https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. “The whole thing was magical,” he said.

Mr. Branson’s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson’s company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career — and a fortune estimated at $6 billion — building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman’s flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson’s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group’s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson’s.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors — and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company’s flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic’s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book “Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut” by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, “I don’t know how we didn’t lose the vehicle and kill three people.”

Mr. Bezos’ flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos’ company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule’s windows, and called Virgin Galactic’s Unity “a high-altitude plane” in contrast to New Shepard’s rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. “Can’t wait to join the club!” he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic’s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy — Axiom’s three customers are paying $55 million each — while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. “Based on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,” she said in an email, “we see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.”

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

“Per minute, it’s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. “Wally Funk was one of our first customers,” Mr. Anderson said. “That would have been like 1998.”

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires — Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

“If anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it’s Branson and Bezos,” Mr. Anderson said. “They have the reach and the cachet.”",2021-07-11 19:55:23,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588440,962 days 02:15:09.588440,470,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oibdub/branson_completes_virgin_galactic_flight_aiming/

z26c8b,stocks,"HP laying off 4,000-6,000 employees globally over the next three years","* **HP’s cost-cutting gesture comes three years after it reduced headcount by up to 9,000.**
* **The company reported weakness in commercial and consumer PC sales during the quarter that ended Oct. 31.**
* **HP also issued light earnings guidance for the new 2023 fiscal year.**

Computer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday that it plans to cut 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years. Shares rose as much as 1% in extended trading following the announcement.

HP is the latest technology company to announce its intent to slim down given economic challenges. Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce are among those that have made similar changes. HP is responding after a deterioration in the sales of computers, which followed brought on by the Covid pandemic, where people rushed to buy computers to work and play from their homes.

In a statement, HP said it expects the changes to result in annualized gross run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in the next three years, with around $1 billion in costs including restructuring. Of that $1 billion, $600 million will come in the fiscal 2023 fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, 2023. The rest will be split evenly between the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, HP said.

As of October 2021, HP had around 51,000 employees. In 2019 HP announced that it would eliminate between 7,000 and 9,000 employees.

HP said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, declined 0.8% year over year to $14.80 billion. Revenue in the Personal Systems segment, which includes PCs, fell 13% to $10.3 billion, as units dropped 21%. Consumer revenue in the segment slid 25%. Printing revenue, at $4.5 billion, was down 7%, as units fell 3%.

In the previous quarter, Personal Systems revenue declined 3%, and Printing revenue moved down 6%.

Also on Tuesday HP announced downbeat earnings guidance.

The company provided a range of adjusted fiscal first quarter earnings from 70 cents to 80 cents per share, below the consensus of 86 cents among analysts polled by Refinitiv.

mgzbrc,stocks,Quick Reminder: Having a portfolio consisting of different tech stocks does not mean you have a ‘Diversified Portfolio’,"To whom it may concern: (I’m aware most of you know how to properly diversify). 

I see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL, TSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is. 

Just a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio means that you have equities with ‘negative correlation’, and/or no correlation in addition to being diversified into different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, cash)(ex. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s). 

Or into different market caps, levels of risk, growth/value, sector/industries as well as domestic and foreign investments. 

Any political, economical, or social catalysts that can affect the tech industry will most likely affect all your investors at the same time, in the same way, therefore just a quick reminder that having a portfolio consisting of only techs does not reduce the overall risk in your portfolio, and if anything, increases it, as such, you are not ‘Diversified’.

This doesn’t just apply to techs, it applies to any portfolio that only has positively correlated assets within the same sector/industries.

Edit: This post is about the concept of having a diversified portfolio, not rate of return or investment objectives, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments and topics relative to diversification.",2021-03-31 05:51:49,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588444,1064 days 16:18:43.588444,384,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgzbrc/quick_reminder_having_a_portfolio_consisting_of/

STOP listening to this bear, these are not bears, they're clowns, seriously this joke that bears have predicted 17 of the last 2 crashes is not even a joke anymore, this dude is the living embodiment of that statement. Last year during the march-may selloff in 2021, this dude said in an interview that the crash has started, and then the S&P 500 went on to close +26.89% for the year. If you followed this guys advice and held cash in 2010, waiting for his prediction to come true, you'd have waited for about 8-10 years on the sidelines until the market had a selloff in late 2018, or when Covid19 crashed the stock market in 2020. By then you'd have lost much more money on the sidelines, than if you'd just let your money grow in the market throughout all those years. Even if you had just listened to his advice last year during the march selloff and sold, then you'd lose out on being up +26.89% if you'd have invested in the indexes instead of listening to him.

Again stop giving these clowns attention, if the market doesn't crash this year and it starts recovering and people get their confidence back in the market, and we have another rally, this dude will say that the market will crash next year, and if that doesn't happen, he'll say it will crash in 2024, and so on and on and on.

ieax69,stocks,"Stock-market wizard William O'Neil famously turned $5,000 into $200,000 in just a few years. Here's the 7-part model he uses to sniff out winning stocks.","""I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and most of them didn't do too well.""

That's what William O'Neil, the legendary trader and author of ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" told Jack Schwager in a 1989 interview for his classic ""Market Wizards"" series.

Out of frustration, O'Neil took the matter into his own hands. He knew a better way to trade was out there — all he had to do was uncover it. After all, he was seeing an array of fund managers crush the competition.

""Back in 1959, I did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market,"" he said. ""At that time, the Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing only about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed the fund, was doubling the results of all his competitors.""

O'Neil scoured Dreyfus' quarterly reports, searching tirelessly for any commonalities he could apply to his own methodology. After mapping out more than 100 of Dreyfus' stock purchase points, O'Neil hit pay dirt.

""There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real discovery: Not some, not most, but every single stock had been bought when it went to a new high price,"" he said.

That unearthing opened the flood gates. O'Neil knew there were more secrets waiting to be uncovered. 

The search continued. 

O'Neil shifted his focus to the market's biggest winners, trying to connect the dots between the characteristics of certain stocks and their superior performance. Eventually, his research culminated in a simple seven-part model: CANSLIM.

Allow O'Neil to explain:

""Each letter of this name represents one of the seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages, just before they made huge advances,"" he said.

O'Neil's discovery translated to massive profits.

""During 1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three exceptional back-to-back trades — short Korvette, long Chrysler, and long Syntex — he managed to parlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000,"" Schwager said.

Let's take a closer look at O'Neil's famed CANSLIM principles. All quotes below are from O'Neil.

C: 'Current earnings per share'

""The 'C' stands for current earnings per share,"" he said. ""So, our first basic rule in stock selection is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.""

A: 'Annual earnings per share'

""In our studies, the prior five-year average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 24%,"" he said. ""Ideally, each year's earnings per share should show an increase over the prior year's earnings.""

N - 'Something New'

""The 'new' can be a new product or service, a change in the industry, or new management,"" he said. ""In our research we found that 95 percent of the greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories.""

S - 'Shares outstanding'

""Ninety-five percent of the stocks that performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance,"" he said. ""Many institutional investors handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies.""

L - 'Leader or laggard'

""So, another basic rule in stock selection is to pick the leading stocks — the ones with the high relative strength values — and avoid the laggard stocks,"" he said. ""I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks above 80.""

I - 'Institutional sponsorship'

""Leading stocks usually have institutional backing,"" he said. ""However, although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general.""

M - 'Market'

""Three out of four stocks will go in the same direction as a significant move in the market averages,"" he said. ""That is why you need to learn how to interpret price and volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped.""",2020-08-22 02:56:16,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588454,1285 days 19:14:16.588455,260,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ieax69/stockmarket_wizard_william_oneil_famously_turned/

1apu7vs,stocks,"Paramount Global lays off about 800 employees, after record Super Bowl","Paramount Global is laying off hundreds of employees, just one day after the company announced CBS had record Super Bowl viewership, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish said Tuesday in an internal memo to employees.

Paramount will lay off about 800 people, or an estimated 3% of its workforce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount Global ended 2022 with about 24,500 full-time and part-time employees.

Affected workers will be notified Tuesday, Bakish said in the note.

“These adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead – and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about,” Bakish wrote in the note.

Deadline first reported the number of cuts last month.

Paramount Global owns a variety of assets including CBS, Paramount Pictures, Pluto TV, Paramount+ and cable networks including Nickelodeon, BET and Comedy Central. The job cuts come as the media company considers merger and acquisition options. Paramount Global has held early merger talks with Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery in recent months, CNBC has previously reported.

The media company had warned employees of impending cuts in an internal memo last month. Bakish said at the time that Paramount Global needed to “operate as a leaner company and spend less.”

Its Paramount+ streaming service continues to lose money each quarter. The platform lost $238 million in the third quarter. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28.

Super Bowl LVIII on CBS was the most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 123.4 million people having watched across all platforms.

CBS charged a record high average $6.5 million for every 30-second advertisement for the Super Bowl according to the research company Guideline.

The network earned tens of millions in additional revenue because the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers went to overtime.

>A filing late Tuesday by Coinbase included a “new risk factor” based on recent Securities and Exchange Commission requirement for public companies that hold cr\*pto assets for third parties.“Because custodially held cr\*pto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the cr\*pto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors,” Coinbase wrote in the filing. Coinbase will take additional steps to ensure that it offers protection for its retail customers that match those offered to Prime and Custody consumers, Armstrong said in Twitter thread late Tuesday. “We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn’t communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added,” Armstrong wrote. “My deepest apologies.”Shares in the company [fell 16%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-10/coinbase-plunges-after-first-quarter-revenue-misses-estimate) after regular trading as first-quarter revenue missed analyst estimates.

>This disclosure makes sense in that **these legal protections have not been tested in court for cr\*pto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings**...

(Emphasis added.)

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/udyyg5/what_is_going_on_with_coin/) last week about COIN asking for opinions because it was trading with a deep margin of safety based on DCF. The stock is down another 54% in the last 13 days since my post following an earnings miss on the top and bottom lines.

I listened to the earnings call yesterday and thought management had a good strategy and plan for execution. However, this news is making me think of the CEO's response to a question from an investor about COIN's moat. Long story short, COIN doesn't really have a moat, but the CEO claims consumer ""trust"" in COIN is like a moat because it allows COIN to sell people who come to their platform to buy or trade cr\*pto new services like NFTs, staking, DeFi, *etc.* They really made a big thing about how much their consumers trust them and how big a competitive advantage that is in a space like cr\*pto where people coming into the market for the first time will generally get into the game through the most trusted name. I think this news — that your assets held by COIN, including their custody business, could be seized in the event of COIN's bankruptcy — should undermine customer trust in COIN. Failing to disclose such a significant risk in a timely manner is a huge red flag for me as a potential investor and attorney.

If there's enough interest from COIN bag-holders, I can do a preliminary legal analysis of the bankruptcy issues to assess the CEO's claim it is ""unlikely"" a court would allow the seizure of Coinbase's customers' cr\*pto. The fact the claim is untested in court is enough for me not to trust the CEO's conclusory opinion.

I personally would not hold my cr\*pto on COIN until there is legal certainty the assets are safe in the case of bankruptcy. Consequently, I have a negative outlook on COIN's custody business; therefore, I have a negative outlook on COIN's so-called moat and ability to upsell new customer's into more products. If people start using COIN for best-price execution only and begin moving their coins to another platform to hold and use their cr\*pto, then COIN's ceiling is a cr\*pto trading platform, not the all-service cr\*pto platform management is selling to investors.",2022-05-11 16:05:34,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588458,658 days 06:04:58.588458,452,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/undaa6/do_you_hold_crpto_on_coinbase_your_assets_could/

* Part time workers will make $21 from currently $15.50.
* Full time workers will be paid $49 an hour an increase of $7.50 over the contract.  Total compensation with benefits will be $170,000.  
* Average base pay before overtime or benefits will be approximately $102,000.
* The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers.
* It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime.
* Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.

American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.

UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.

The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.

“Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.

UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.

UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.

Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.

UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.

The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”

The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.

On Monday, American Airlines
pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union. Delta Air Lines

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.",2023-05-15 14:39:43,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588462,289 days 07:30:49.588462,306,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ia8cg/eu_approves_microsofts_69_billion_acquisition_of/

President and CEO Dan Schulman wrote in the release that the company is working to address the “challenging macroeconomic environment.” He said the company has made progress focusing resources on core priorities and rightsizing its cost structure, but that there is more work to be done.

“Change can be difficult – particularly when it includes valued colleagues and friends departing,” Schulman wrote. “We will face this head-on together, drawing on the unparalleled scale of our global platform, the strategic investments we have made to strengthen our core capabilities, and the trust and loyalty of our customers.”",2023-01-31 19:41:43,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588463,393 days 02:28:49.588463,288,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10q8d0s/paypal_to_lay_off_2000_employees_in_coming_weeks/

It marks the first time a standalone piece of marijuana reform legislation has ever been sent to the president’s desk.

> The bill “would eliminate the red tape that hinders cannabis research, opening the door for new innovative treatments derived from cannabis,” Schumer said ahead of the vote. “If you’re one of the millions of Americans who deals with conditions like Parkinson’s or epilepsy or post-traumatic stress, or any number of other conditions, cannabis might hold promising new options for managing these diseases.”

> Just before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the floor that he is continuing to have “productive talks” about a broader package of cannabis reforms he hopes to pass before the end of the lame duck session.

lszqy7,stocks,Don't give up before you get good.,"Dig through my history. This isn't a self-therapy post after a down week. I've been doing this for a long time.

The reason people fail at this is that their opening trades are way too big for their accounts. And when they are wrong, they are set-back so far that after a string of losing trades, they simply cannot afford to continue.

Let's say I have $1,000,000 in my account. Each trade I open up is rarely above $30,000 to $50,000 dollars or 3% to 5%. And on a $30,000 to $50,000 trade, I'm perfectly happy if I make around $3,000 to $5,000 per trade for the WEEK or even BIWEEKLY! Now that does not seem particularly impressive but if I make 6 trades and 3 of them swing the right way, while the 3 others don't, it's still a pretty good week in terms of absolute dollars. On the 3 where I am wrong, I exit at -3% no matter what happens. This ensures that wins on average are at least 3x bigger than my losses. Also, I only actively trade 15% - 20% of my account. Profits from trades go into long-term positions that I never sell and only add to.

 Now let's say you start with $20,000. This means each trade should really only be about $1,000. So you're thinking, ""What? I can't make a living day trading generating a $100 a week per trade on a good week!!""

No. You can't and you shouldn't. This is why folks should not quit their day job to do this. I didn't quit my day job to do this until 10 years after I started doing this. And here's why.

The professional trader and fund managers are not intrinsically smarter than you. They traditionally had more timely information. That gap has been narrowed with the internet. Where professionals and funds beat you is scale. Here's an exaggerated example. If I can buy 100,000 shares and you can only buy 100, and both of us need $50 today to pay bills, I have virtually no risk whereas you need to hope for a 50% daily return. Most traders who do this at home for income do not make a huge amount of money. I certainly don't. But a large account built over time allows the trader to risk less and less to maintain the same income year over year. Huge funds make shit trades every day. But each trade is less than a fraction of 1% of their book. So stop beating yourself up. The reason you're not doing well is your account is simply too small and you're relying way too much on luck. It takes time and dedication to accumulate enough money. Stop telling yourself you should be further ahead as that thinking will kill you. A lot of you literally started a few months ago. Sometimes you'll have windfalls. Most of the time, trading is boring as shit.

So don't feel bad if you're not getting it right away. You have to tune out the posts where you see people posting wins and losses as that will get you to start gambling instead of trading. A lot of you folks are not 'bad' at this. For some reason, you've just assumed you were 'good' without enough evidence.

Also, I'm not particularly stoic or emotionless on big wins and losses. The long-term positions in my account all got hammered these last few weeks. I will still get pumped or upset and I share with a trading buddy. Find yourself a trading buddy.

TLDR because I am apparently not clear: don't feel bad if you're not successful yet.  You need to get to a decent account size before this starts to click.  

Edit: you guys are nuts and maybe I'm to blame.  I said here is an example.  I even explicitly say I lose half the time.  What on earth did I say that implies I'm a trillionaire?!

Edit: I used perfectly round numbers for examples.  Come on man.  The message is you're struggling because you don't have scale not ""I'm a superstar."" In addition, I didn't start from zero and never implied that I did.

Edit: Holy crap, I even said 'lets say I had..."" to start the example.  The message is about scale and needing time to accumulate.  What on earth are you reading that I'm not seeing?  Y'all need to chill out.  Does it make you feel better to hear me say I also lost a bunch of money on paper this week as well?

Edit: never said I was good at stock picking.  The only thing I will take credit for is limiting losses.",2021-02-26 15:16:35,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588466,1097 days 06:53:57.588466,402,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lszqy7/dont_give_up_before_you_get_good/
12gdak5,stocks,A $1.5 Trillion Wall of Debt Is Looming for US Commercial Properties,"Almost $1.5 trillion of US commercial real estate debt comes due for repayment before the end of 2025. The big question facing those borrowers is who’s going to lend to them?

“Refinancing risks are front and center” for owners of properties from office buildings to stores and warehouses, Morgan Stanley analysts including James Egan wrote in a note this past week. “The maturity wall here is front-loaded. So are the associated risks.”

The investment bank estimates office and retail property valuations could fall as much as 40% from peak to trough, increasing the risk of defaults.

Adding to the headache, small and regional banks — the biggest source of credit to the industry last year — have been rocked by deposit outflows following the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, raising concerns that will crimp their ability to provide finance to borrowers.

Palantir’s boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if “such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that “many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.”

He added, without naming anyone, that this is because “people who have nothing to offer want to study AI,” but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, “studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield” is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an “A.I. race” akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that “there is already an A.I. arms race, it’s just we’re ahead, [and] it’s not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.”

He pointed out that the “single most important event” in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir’s AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield “just throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,” Karp said. He added, “especially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There’s only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.”",2023-06-09 12:24:41,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588469,264 days 09:45:51.588469,325,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1453tou/tech_leaders_are_calling_for_an_ai_pause_because/

My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",2020-08-28 01:58:08,2024-02-28 22:10:32.588475,1279 days 20:12:24.588475,534,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ihyea8/how_i_applied_buffets_strategies_to_my_own/
s9iwqn,stocks,Disney is now trading at same price as before pandemic ($137),"This really blows my mind. Pros for Disney:

* It is now trading as if none of the growth of Disney+ happened at all.
* Omicron news is getting better all the time. 
* Given weaker growth for Netflix, it might give Disney more room to catch up in content.

Possible cons:

* Maybe Netflix's failure is a sign that streaming is a tough business and if Netflix can't do it well, how could Disney?
* Eternals show us that it's not that easy to create hits. Marvel can't win every single time.
* There's some concerns regarding Disney's CEO.

iexyez,stocks,Oil stocks - the time is now,"Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

PS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away

TLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets

ncfwmz,stocks,"Amazon To Hire 75K Fulfillment Workers With Starting Hourly Pay Of $17, Bonuses Up To $1K","'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment workers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

11v5b3f,stocks,Is Warren Buffett trying to repeat his 2008 bailout success with Biden officials?,"According to this article ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-contact-biden-officials-222309661.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-contact-biden-officials-222309661.html)), Warren Buffett has been in contact with Biden administration officials about various economic issues, including inflation, taxes, and infrastructure. The article speculates that Buffett may be trying to influence policy decisions that could benefit his company, Berkshire Hathaway, or his personal investments.

This reminds me of how Buffett played a crucial role in the 2008 financial crisis, when he bailed out several banks and companies with his billions of dollars. He also advised then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to inject capital into the banks rather than buying their toxic assets, which helped stabilize the financial system and prevent a deeper recession. (Sources: [**1**](https://www.cnbc.com/id/40276100), [**2**](https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/article/how-warren-buffett-clinched-2008-bailouts), [**3**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-goldman-sachs-sale-billions-return-bailout-2020-5-1029212109))

Buffett made a handsome profit from his 2008 deals, netting more than $3 billion from his $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs alone. He also received favorable terms and dividends from other firms he rescued, such as Bank of America and General Electric.

Could Buffett be looking for another opportunity to profit from a crisis? Is he trying to sway Biden officials to adopt policies that would create favorable conditions for his businesses or investments? Or is he genuinely concerned about the state of the economy and the welfare of the American people?

One thing that makes me suspicious is that there have been 20+ private jets that flew into Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett lives and runs Berkshire Hathaway.

vm5ern,stocks,Disney's Granddaughter Poised to Mount Shareholder Battle Over Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s $32.5 Million Salary,"This story is about a week old, however I've not seen anyone talking about this.

[Full article from New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/06/21/abigail-disney-wants-to-challenge-bob-chapeks-pay-report/):

Abigail Disney, the Mouse House heiress turned vocal critic, is reportedly attempting to organize a shareholder challenge of embattled Disney boss Bob Chapek’s $32.5 million payday.

Disney, who has pegged her personal net worth at $120 million, has been “quietly courting” institutional investors to challenge Chapek’s compensation at the company’s next shareholder meeting, The Wrap reported, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.

The proxy push could mark another embarrassment for Chapek, who has been under fire following a series of missteps at the entertainment giant.

The 62-year-old heiress has reportedly held at least three meetings in an effort to build support for the move, through which participants would reject or potentially seek to claw back some of Chapek’s pay. She has argued that her name recognition would provide the company’s shareholders with a better chance in the fight at the meeting, which will be held next spring.

One unnamed institutional investor approached by Disney reportedly described their meeting as a “very informal discussion that was very serious,” while another investor told The Wrap that the discussion was preliminary in nature.

“Fund managers run into each other at industry events all the time and talk shop,” the investor told the outlet. “And Abigail wanted to know what they thought, what the mood was. She seemed mostly interested in if this was that perfect opportunity for something like this.”

Both a Disney spokesperson and Abigail Disney declined The Wrap’s request for comment on the report.

The Post has reached out to Disney and Abigail Disney’s production company, Fork Films, for further comment.

Chapek, who replaced Bob Iger as Disney CEO in 2020, has faced intense criticism over the botched response to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. One former Disney executive reportedly said that the company’s leadership “managed to piss off both the left and the right’ by flip-flopping in reaction to the legislation.

The Chapek-led company faced internal protests from left-leaning workers as well as a public spat with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who revoked the company’s special tax status. The incident sparked speculation that Iger could return to replace Chapek as Disney’s top boss.

More recently, Chapek shocked the entertainment world by firing Disney’s well-regarded TV content executive Peter Rice – a move that reportedly led to “terrible” morale at the Mouse House. Still, Disney Chairman Susan Arnold issued a vote of confidence for Chapek in the wake of that decision.

Disney’s stock has also struggled, sinking 40% during a broader downturn in the market since January and about 46% over the last 12 months.

Abigail Disney’s behind-the-scenes push is the latest sign of her willingness to criticize the company founded by her grandfather, Roy O. Disney.

The heiress co-directed a documentary entitled “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales,” which called out pay inequality at Disney. Released earlier this year, the film highlighted the struggles of park workers compared to the lifestyle of Iger, who earned $65.6 million in 2018.

Abigail Disney also has a history of criticizing executive pay at Disney – once referring to Iger’s windfall in 2018 as “insane.” At the time, Equilar determined that Iger earned 1,424 times the pay of the median Disney employees.

The CCP is pissed off because it wants to know about the flaw first.

As the result, CCP pulled support for BABA cloud services for 6 months.

The real reason:  CCP wants to know about the flaw first so it can take advantage of the security hole.  What a bunch of crooks.

xj2ow6,stocks,Beyond Meat (BYND) COO Arrested for Biting Man’s Nose After College Football Game,"Not a joke - that's a real headline (and a perfect setup for so many jokes).  

It's been a rocky few years for BYND - just last month, they slashed their revenue outlook for the year and said it would cut 4% of its workforce.  This arrest surely doesn't help.  Doug Ramsey, 53, just became COO at BYND last December after 30 years at Tyson Foods.   

From bloomberg:  

*Ramsey was arrested on charges of terroristic threatening and third-degree battery, court records show. Ramsey was allegedly at a parking garage when a Subaru inched in front of his Bronco, coming into contact with the front tire on the passenger’s side, according to a report by local station KNWA/KFTA.*

*Ramsey got out of his car and “punched through the back windshield of the Subaru,” according to the report. The Beyond Meat executive allegedly then started punching the owner of the car, who had left the vehicle, and also “bit the owner’s nose, ripping the flesh on the tip.” He also “threatened to kill” the other man, according to the report.* 

Yikes.  Hoping BYND has a good public relations team.",2022-09-20 08:01:11,2024-02-28 22:10:34.218883,526 days 14:09:23.218883,242,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xj2ow6/beyond_meat_bynd_coo_arrested_for_biting_mans/

I want to raise awareness because this subreddit is a target.)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/) post about copper miners just hit the top of /r/investing, and it's a good example of the obvious astroturfing effort that's going on.

Take a look at this account's [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/) and you'll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like /r/aww, /r/nextfuckinglevel, /r/MadeMeSmile, /r/funny, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.

Take a look at the post content and you'll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free 'analysis' about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of 'pitch' paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.

I've been noticing this happening in /r/investing and /r/stocks over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about 'mining', 'copper', 'gold', and other such keywords.

10gtnwd,stocks,"Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/google-cutting-12-000-jobs-in-6-slash-to-global-workforce

Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

The cuts will affect jobs globally and across the entire company, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday, writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”

With the layoffs, Google joins a host of other tech giants that have drastically scaled back operations amid a faltering global economy and soaring inflation. Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks. Thanks to a resilient search business, Google has been one of the longest tech holdouts avoiding major workforce reductions. But the company is dealing with a slowdown in digital advertising and its cloud-computing division continues to trail Amazon and Microsoft Corp. 

“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” Pichai wrote in the email. 

He said the company has a “substantial opportunity in front of us” with artificial intelligence, a key investment area where Google is facing a surge in recent competition. 

In October, the company reported earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations. Profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year. At the time, Pichai said Google would curb its expenses and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the number of new jobs would fall by more than half in the fourth quarter from the previous period.

Google’s reduction in headcount follows investor pressure to adopt a more aggressive strategy to curb spending. In November, TCI Fund Management Ltd. urged the internet search giant in an open letter to publicly set a target for profit margins, increase share buybacks and reduce losses in its portfolio of Other Bets, Alphabet’s moonshot division. “The company has too many employees and the cost per employee is too high,” TCI Managing Director Chris Hohn said, noting that Alphabet’s headcount had swelled 20% per year since 2017.

According to the human-resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the most job cuts in 2022 were in the tech sector — 97,171 for the year, up 649% compared to the previous year.

Google has made a series of cost-cutting moves in recent months, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and permanently shuttering Stadia, its cloud gaming service. Earlier in January, Verily, a biotech unit of Alphabet, said it was cutting 15% of its staff. 

Pichai said Alphabet would be paying affected employees 16 weeks of severance and six months worth of health benefits in the US, with other regions receiving packages based on local laws and practices.",2023-01-20 10:34:30,2024-02-28 22:10:34.218904,404 days 11:36:04.218904,599,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10gtnwd/google_cutting_12000_jobs_in_6_slash_to_global/

Over the years there were definitely times I wanted to sell for dumb reasons, like wanting to buy a new car, or start using it for options trading, or reinvest in some other fad. But I held off. 

Now, I need the money for a down payment on a first home for my wife and I. This ticker has always been in my brokerage account alongside every other trade I've done. It was really hard selling it, but I know it's exactly why I've been holding it all these years. Now, it's giving me the opportunity to afford a home for my family, and I am unspeakably grateful. 

I'm fortunate enough that my grandparents are still around and I can tell them myself how much of a gift they gave me all those years ago. I kept a few shares for the sentimentality, maybe I'll pass them down someday too.

I could never invest in tobacco, oil, defence, MLM stocks like herbalife, diamond mines, huge shady banks like goldman, or just morally abhorrent companies like nestle and Monsanto 

I know you could make the argument that every company is actually morally abhorrent because they exist solely to make money and I'd agree with you, but in a late capitalist world where the wealth gap is higher than ever and social climbing is at the lowest it has ever been you have to make bread in some way or another

So why would I give my money to any of them and contribute to helping them reach their goals? How would it be moral to profit off these bloodsucking leeches?

I know wallstreet is sociopath/psychopath central, I mean they collapsed the global economy in 2008 because they were making so much money fucking over the average person but I really hate that attitude that you should leave morals at the door when investing.

There are so many comparisons a person can make today with everything that has happened lately. I won't continue the comparisons with how stock prices reflect now vs 2020 any more, but I will say I think the worst is yet to come and the recession is just beginning.

We came back a month later when the reality of the recession being just much worse than we thought was all coming crashing down. That same $640 valued display now had a price-tag of $228.

u9ktez,stocks,I cancelled my membership with Motley Fool today. Their marketing made me do it.,"There's a quote from Warren Buffett in the preface to *The Intelligent Investor*: ""To invest successfully over a lifetime does not take a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What's needed is a sound intellectual framework and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework. This book describes the proper framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.""

Put simply, the Motley Fools are not emotionally disciplined. Or rather, they train us as readers to not be disciplined. Every day, I was bombarded with emails: ""5 new stocks to buy now!"" ""Here's why WXYZ stock dropped today!""

A long-term investor who believes in a business should not care about why a stock added or dropped in 10% in a day. We should not be trying to time the market with 5 new stocks. We should probably not even care about a quarterly earnings report. As Buffett says, ""My favorite holding period is forever"".

What's more, I don't particularly trust the dynamic of withholding ""rule-breaking"" or ""everlasting"" stocks from readers. It's hard enough to get returns that regularly outperform the market. The fact that there are different ""services"" makes me feel as if when I pay for the ""advisor"" subscription, my ""advisor"" is not working as hard as he can on my portfolio. He's withholding information from me. That seems very shady.

It's possible that the Fools have made 400% over the past 20 years. And it's possible they could continue to make 400%. And I understand they need to upsell to keep their business. But as *The Intelligent Investor* makes clear, you shouldn't wrap your net worth in a speculative account. Most of your money should be in index funds. And if the Fools are going to be pounding at my psyche every day, grinding down my emotional discipline, it doesn't matter how good the picks are. I'm going to make bad decisions.

Idk what all your thoughts are on this sub but that's my feeling on TMF.

oyfih9,stocks,"Robinhood retreats after monster rally this week as stockholders file to sell 97,9 million shares!","Robinhood said on Thursday in an amended filing that existing shareholders will sell up 97.9 million shares over time. The news knocked shares of the trading app that have surged this week.

The commission-free broker will not receive any of the proceeds from the stock sale of 97,876,033 shares of its Class A common stock. The offering is through an automatic conversion of certain convertible notes held by the selling stockholders in connection with its initial public offering.

The stockholders were among those that came to Robinbood’s rescue during the historic trading mania earlier this year. Faced with unprecedented volatility and increased deposit requirements, the broker was forced to tap credit lines and raised new debt to ensure it has enough cash to clear trades. It also briefly restricted trading in a number of short-squeeze names.

These selling shareholders include a number of venture capital firms that invested in Robinhood early on. For instance, New Enterprise Associates, which owns more than 10% of Robinhood shares, is among the list of sellers in this offering. Andreessen Horowitz, ICONIQ Capital, Institutional Venture Partners and Ribbit Capital were also among the selling stockholders.

> Lots of posts in this sub asking for advice on how to make money based on riots, and the fact is no one gives a shit and there’s no money to be made on that.

The whole post is filled with top-level comments joking about how everyone on Reddit is stupid for asking and how there's so clearly no money to be made just because people are rioting. To all those looking for opportunity, this is why you should take everything you read on Reddit with a dump truck full of salt.

Clearly the OP of that thread hasn't even been trading long enough, or wasn't active enough in the markets to remember the [almost completely identical situation in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014-2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest) which sent the stocks of three companies flying, among others that made similar but smaller moves. 

[DGLY \(Digital Ally, Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dgly) makes police body cameras and went HAM in August of 2014 as the riots in Ferguson heated up, [rising from under $4.00 to almost $34.00 (yes that's 750%) in less than a month](https://i.imgur.com/QWWBEtq.png)

[ISNS \(Image Sensing Systems Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=isns) makes video and radar processing equipment primarily used in traffic management and traffic data collection. While not a direct riot play, in 2014 it caught momentum from day traders trading DGLY and [rose from $2.50 to $10.00 in six days.](https://i.imgur.com/8vHHf1Z.png). Oh yeah, and it's headquartered in St. Paul, MN, right in the guts of Minneapolis.

[TASR \(TASER International, now trading under the ticker AAXN\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaxn) makes tasers, body cameras and video recording systems for police and has a market cap of nearly $5 billion. It was the leader of the rallies in the ""riot stocks"" in 2014 which triggered all the low float ones like ISNS and DGLY to take off. Between July of 2014 and July of 2015 [it rose from $10.50 to $36.00](https://i.imgur.com/zzZpAuI.png), largely driven by speculation about the effect the riots would have on police regulations.

By the way, DGLY is up 33% today with no news or SEC filings to be found. Coincidence? I don't think so. Traders who were involved in it in 2014 remember its potential just like everyone remembered IBIO and LAKE at the beginning of the coronavirus situation. Where did they remember them from?

q7y25k,stocks,Deere & Co. workers go on strike after rejecting contract,"https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/deere-workers-strike-rejecting-contract-80573596

MOLINE, Ill. -- More than 10,000 Deere & Co. workers went on strike Thursday after “the company failed to present an agreement that met our members’ demands and needs,” the United Auto Workers union said in statement.

The union had said its members would walk off the job if no deal has been reached by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday. The vast majority of the union rejected a contract offer earlier this week that would have delivered 5% raises to some workers and 6% raises to others.

“The almost one million UAW retirees and active members who stand in solidarity with the striking UAW members at John Deere,"" UAW President Ray Curry said.

Brad Morris, vice president of labor relations for Deere, said in a statement that the company is ""committed to a favorable outcome for our employees, our communities and everyone involved.” He said Deere wants an agreement that would improve the economic position of all employees.

“We will keep working day and night to understand our employees’ priorities and resolve this strike, while also keeping our operations running for the benefit of all those we serve,” Morris said.

Thirty-five years have passed since the last major Deere strike, but workers were emboldened to demand more this year after working long hours throughout the pandemic and because companies are facing worker shortages.

“Our members at John Deere strike for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules,” said Chuck Browning, vice president and director of the UAW’s Agricultural Implement Department. “We stay committed to bargaining until our members’ goals are achieved.”

Chris Laursen, who works as a painter at Deere, told the Des Moines Register before the strike that it could make a significant difference.

“The whole nation’s going to be watching us,” Laursen said to the newspaper. “If we take a stand here for ourselves, our families, for basic human prosperity, it’s going to make a difference for the whole manufacturing industry. Let’s do it. Let’s not be intimidated.”

Earlier this year, another group of UAW-represented workers went on strike at a Volvo Trucks plant in Virginia and wound up with better pay and lower-cost health benefits after rejecting three tentative contract offers.


The contracts under negotiation covered 14 Deere plants across the United States, including seven in Iowa, four in Illinois and one each in Kansas, Colorado and Georgia.

The contract talks at the Moline, Illinois-based company were unfolding as Deere is expecting to report record profits between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion this year. The company has been reporting strong sales of its agricultural and construction equipment this year.

The Deere production plants are an important contributors to the economy, so local officials hope any strike will be short-lived.

“We definitely want to see our economy stabilize and grow after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Moline Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati said to the Quad-Cities Times. “Hopefully, these parties can come to a resolution soon.”",2021-10-14 11:49:11,2024-02-28 22:10:34.218954,867 days 10:21:23.218954,355,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q7y25k/deere_co_workers_go_on_strike_after_rejecting/

ytlgev,stocks,Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.,"Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.

Tesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”

The charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.

Tesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.

Tesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.

However, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.

The company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.

If automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks.

u4s7hl,stocks,"Mark Cuban says Elon Musk is 'f--king with the SEC,' thinks Twitter will 'do everything possible not to sell'"," 

FROM ARTICLE 

[Musk offered to buy Twitter for about $43 billion on Thursday](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/mark-cuban-says-musk-is-f-with-the-sec-thinks-twitter-will-do-everything-possible-not-to-sell?cmpid=fb_fbn)  
  

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban chimed in on Elon Musk's attempt to purchase Twitter for $43 billion, saying that he thinks the Tesla CEO is ""f------ with the SEC"" and that Twitter will do everything in their power not to sell. 

Musk, a popular user on the site with more than 81 million followers, announced the offer on Thursday morning to buy all outstanding shares for $54.20 each. 

""I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Musk said in a Securities and Exchange Commission fling. ""I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.""  
  

The offer per share, $54.20, is reminiscent of Musk's infamous 2018 tweet in which he said he had the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which caused Tesla's stock to jump but never materialized. 

Musk frequently cracks ""420"" jokes, as the number is slang for marijuana. 

Tesla and Musk settled with the SEC for $40 million in civil fines after he said he had the money to take Tesla private. 

""His filing w/the SEC allows him to say he wants to take a company private for $54.20. Vs his ‘Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.’ Price go up. His shares get sold. Profit,"" Cuban tweeted. ""SEC like WTF just happened."" 

 

Cuban also said he thinks ""every major tech company… is on the phone with their anti trust lawyers asking if they can buy Twitter and get it approved."" 

""And Twitter is on the phone with their lawyers asking which can be their white knight,"" Cuban tweeted. ""Gonna be interesting.""

 Musk's offer to buy Twitter came 10 days after he announced that he had been buying shares of Twitter since Jan. 31, netting him about a 9% stake in the company.  

 

On Sunday evening, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal sent a message to all employees notifying them that Musk declined to join the company's board. 

 

In the weeks before he announced his 9% stake, Musk criticized Twitter for its moderation policies, saying that ""failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy."" 

Twitter has been criticized in recent years for banning high-profile figures, such as former President Donald Trump, Republican Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. 

 

Musk said Thursday that it would ""be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.""

""If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty,"" Musk tweeted. ",2022-04-16 07:03:14,2024-02-28 22:10:34.218975,683 days 15:07:20.218976,361,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u4s7hl/mark_cuban_says_elon_musk_is_fking_with_the_sec/

Ford sent an internal email Monday to employees, saying it would begin notifying affected salaried and agency workers this week of the cuts. The email was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The workforce reduction mostly targets employees in the U.S., Canada and India. About 2,000 of the targeted cuts will be salaried jobs at the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker. The remaining 1,000 employees are working in contract positions with outside agencies, the company said.

The cuts weren’t unexpected. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported in July that layoffs were coming for white-collar staff as part of a broader restructuring to sharpen the car company’s focus on electric vehicles and the batteries that power them.

Every time crude oil prices have rises by 50% of the standard deviation over a 50 yr period, the stock market has experienced a full recession. We are breaking into that ceiling currently and with the Nasdaq officially entering a correction, there is a VERY high probability the market will fall much further. While this is just a correlation, and a very tight one at that, the possibility of a direct causation is entirely plausible as oil is a commodity that effects nearly all aspects of our lives. It should be noted that foreign wars aren't the only things driving up prices, inflation has hit record highs with the 2 year treasury being close to matching the 10 yr treasury payout which is a phenomenal event. The only real upside to all of this is that corporate earning seem to be doing fine and the fed can still take actions to address inflation without likely escalading the situation which would not prevent a crash, but reduce the time it occurs. This is not financial advise, but I am hedging against further drops to my portfolio though inverse ETFs or other means to prevent excessive bleeding if a crash is to occur.

“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: “We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,”

“As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,” 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That’s expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

Six Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers were confirmed dead on Saturday after a series of tornadoes roared through a warehouse near St. Louis, ripping off its roof and causing 11-inch thick concrete walls longer than football fields to collapse on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.

Witnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find. ""I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,"" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street. ""People had to think on their feet quick."" Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area. Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.

It was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said. Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel. Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. ""We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,"" she told Reuters. 

Earlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter that the company was ""heartbroken over the loss"" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community. ""All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,"" Bezos wrote.

I started investing in 2017. I was proud of myself after going from $5000 to $6000 then I started taking huge risks on penny stocks, adding more money to my account, and soon found myself down huge. I walked away when I was down $5000. I came back a year ago with a new outlook. I recognized I had been making the same mistakes over and over and there were the big lessons I had to learn:

- be skeptical of a company you’ve never heard of; stay away completely until doing lots of research.
- hold good-performing stocks for a long time
- gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.
- read the news (world news, national news, etc.)
- make a plan and stick to it unless you learn information that gives you evidence that your plan is worth changing.
- take advantage of the worst stock market crash ever (LOL)

uv7ueo,stocks,Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP),"Shopify had a crazy stock-price movement in the last 2 years, went from roughly $350 prior to the pandemic, to almost $1,800 (almost 5x) at its peak, and is now down to $364 (80% down).

The goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation of this highly volatile company. Feel free to provide your feedback and disagree with me :)

At the peak, the market cap was over $220b, let's keep that number in mind. Today, it's around $46b. Let's get started!

&#x200B;

**What is Shopify?**

In one sentence, it is an eCommerce website builder that takes care of the infrastructure and provides additional services/solutions (payment processing, marketing, analytics, inventory & fulfillment, etc.). It allows setting up and operating a business online easier.

&#x200B;

**How does Shopify make money?**

The revenue is split into two groups:

1. Subscription revenue - This is self-explanatory, and refers to the monthly recurring revenue that Shopify gets from the individuals/businesses that use their platform. This stream of revenue doesn't depend on the success of the users. Regardless if a company sells 1 product or a million, the subscription revenue is fixed. In my view, this is the less-risky stream as they'd only lose customers if they switch to another platform (not that likely) or a business goes bankrupt. Historically, this stream grew 50% year-over-year, now almost $1.4b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). This is also a high-margin business, with a gross margin of 80%.

&#x200B;

2. Merchant solutions - This is the segment that takes all of the other revenue and is highly dependent on the success of the individuals and businesses that use the platform. Payment processing fees, currency conversion, referrals, advertising, etc, all of that is included here. If there's a slowdown in the economy and the eCommerce business decreases, this stream of Shopify would be harmed. In the last years, it grew roughly 75% year-over-year to almost $3.5b in the last twelve months. The gross margin in this segment is lower (43%).

&#x200B;

The overall gross margin has been decreasing and if we only look at that in isolation, the conclusion would be that something bad is going on and Shopify cannot keep its margins at the same level. This is not correct. The reason for the margin decline is only due to the fact that the lower-margin revenue stream (Merchant solutions) is growing faster than the higher-margin revenue stream (Subscription-based). Hence, the gross margin naturally moves closer to the stream that contributes more.

So, the total revenue is close to $5b. If we put this next to the market cap at its peak of $220b, it seems quite unreasonable for anyone to pay such a huge premium. Yes, the company has been growing at high rates, but the growth cannot continue at that pace forever. The moment the growth declines, that's where the problems start and a correction comes in, so it's always wise to incorporate this growth decline in the model and not assume growth of 50-60% for a very long period of time.

The overall gross margin is at 53% for the last 12 months and it is expected to drop even further. Let's keep it simple and assume that it will decrease to 50%.

&#x200B;

**Operating expenses**

With the remaining 50%, Shopify needs to cover 3 main expenses to get to the operating result.

1. Sales & marketing - Decreased from 34% of revenue (2017) to 21% in LTM.

2. R&D - Remains stable at around 20% of revenue in the last 5 years

3. G&A - Remains stable at around 10% of revenue in the last 5 years

&#x200B;

By subtracting these 3 costs, we get to an operating profit of 1%. So, a company with revenue below $5b and no operating profit, was selling for $220b. That sound quite irrational. Of course, there are a couple of other factors to consider.

Every growth company puts as much effort as possible into growing quickly. For Shopify, that's mainly in Sales & Marketing and R&D. The more potential customers they can reach, the faster they can grow. The more they can innovate, the more services they can provide. However, as the growth slows down, these costs as % of revenue decrease. The marketing won't yield the same returns as before, simply because the # of potential customers decreases. All of this will lead to margin expansion.

&#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

There are a couple of main points to mention:

1. Shopify is a capital-light business that doesn't need to invest in tangible assets in significant amounts.

2. They have a strong cash position ($7.2b in cash & short term investments + $2.9b in long-term investments)

3. The debt is at a very low level, roughly $1.2b (insignificant compared to their $10b cash/investments). It could be argued that they didn't use the low-interest rates to increase their financial leverage.

&#x200B;

Recently, Shopify announced the acquisition of Deliverr for $2.1b, a company that will add value in their process of inventory inbounding and distribution. The aim is to offer delivery to the customer within 2 days of ordering (Competitive with Amazon Prime). This is not yet paid, so needs to be deducted when valuing Shopify as a company)

&#x200B;

**DCF model**

Key assumptions:

1. Revenue growth: 25% for the next 5 years, then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of almost 3%.

2. Operating profit: Slowly improve to 25% (Basically, the 3 types of expenses mentioned above, combined, should decrease to 25% of revenue over the next 10 years)

3. Discount rate - 11.7% (Based on WACC)

Outcome: **Value per share - $276/share (current market price - $364)**

My assumptions are based on what I think Shopify can deliver with high probability. Could be I be wrong? Absolutely!

&#x200B;

**What if I'm wrong?**

Based on my assumptions, the revenue will grow by 426% in 10 years and the operating margin is estimated at 25%. However, I could be significantly wrong. Therefore, the table below provides a valuation of the company based on assumptions different than mine related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|300% ($19.0b)|$190.1|$229.3|$269.1|
|426% ($24.4b)|$226.8|$275.8|$326.4|
|1000% ($51.0b)|$400.3|$500.5|$601.0|
|3350% (159.9b)|$1,089.9|$1,388.4|$1,687.0|

Based on your assumptions about the revenue growth and margin expansion of Shopify, you can decide whether the company is expensive or not at this price.

The last row is only for illustration of how irrational the market was in the last year when the price went up to almost $1800. Basically, to justify that valuation, the company would need to grow the revenue by around 50% every year for the next decade and at the same time improve its operating margin to 30%. So, starting with the gross profit being around 50%, the Sales & Marketing, R&D, and G&A together, should be 20% of sales.

The email from Carvana CEO Ernie Garcia, titled “Today is a hard day,” cites economic headwinds including higher financing costs and delayed car purchasing. He says the company “failed to accurately predict how this would all play out and the impact it would have on our business.”

The layoffs mainly impact employees in Carvana’s corporate and tech departments as well as some operational roles where it is “eliminating roles, locations or shifts to match our size with the current environment,” according to the letter.

Garcia said impacted employees will receive separation and severance pay, extended healthcare coverage for three months and other other benefits.

“To those impacted, I am sorry,” Garcia said. “As you all know, we made a similar decision to this one in May. It is fair to ask why this is happening again, and yet I am not sure I can answer it as clearly as you deserve.”

There would be no reason to watch their videos daily. Or their market open and close live streams. The views are how they make their money. Meet Kevin for example makes millions each month off the views.

So these financial youtubers talk about short term plays and high frequency trading so once one play is over you come back for the next. Or they talk about 5, 10, etc stocks they are buying each week.

Yes there is money made in swing/day trading there is also people who lose a lot of money and dont talk about it so you just here from the winners.

lhujhn,stocks,Weed stocks are NOT like GME.,"Someone needed to say this. 

There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also ample signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.

That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like ""weed is dead"" and ""I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz.""

For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.

These are not short squeeze/hype/meme stocks. Please stop looking at them as such.

Edit for clarification: People seem to think that I’m bragging? about holding for over a month. I’m not. I only brought up that I entered into a position over a month ago to say that I bought shares based on the company-I didn’t buy shares within the last couple of days because Reddit was hyping it. Congratulations to everyone who has been holding this stock for much longer than I have!

qzm7ni,stocks,Biden picks Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for a second term as the U.S. battles Covid and inflation,"Jerome Powell, who guided the Federal Reserve and the nation’s economy through the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S. central bank.

President Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.

Brainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.

“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.

The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.

In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.

The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.

“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”

Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.

The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.

At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.

Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.

The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.

The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”

Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.

A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.

The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.

Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”

“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.

Political pressure, and a Covid struggle
President Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.

Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.

As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.

The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.

To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.

Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. 

“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.

“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. 

“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” 

Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. 

The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.",2021-11-22 14:08:44,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219064,828 days 08:01:50.219064,397,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qzm7ni/biden_picks_jerome_powell_to_lead_the_fed_for_a/

jbnkzh,stocks,"'Nightmare' U.S. stock valuations driven by 'young, dumb' investors, fund manager says","U.S. equity valuations have become a ""total nightmare"" fueled by ""young and dumb"" investors, according to Cole Smead, president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.

At present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).

Much of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.

""The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

He added that current valuations were an example of ""stock market failure"" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve ""can't save a stock market.""

""They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,"" Smead said.

A call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.

""In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,"" Smead added.

He suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to ""ride the index to a fault"" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.

""Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.""

Despite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.

I went through similar cycles as the first time (perhaps with a bit more knowledge, wisdom and maturity than the first time).  The game is even harder now though.  The HFT's and Algo's are programmed just so perfectly to squeeze out your money, even if it is one penny at a time.  Once again, after wasting many years, I found myself at the bottom.

I will spare you the rest and jump straight to the ending:  I am nearing 36 years old, and my portfolio is nearly non existent.  I am not poor, and I own a nice little business ... but I am also filled with regret.

Had I never started trading, and had I just continued investing, I would probably be a multi millionaire based on the trajectory I was headed by this point.  I also would have gotten to skip many years of shame, doubt and guilt.

The amount of people in this day and age that are actually successful traders are so god damn few and far in between.  There is a reason the entire world has moved to quant systems.  Computers trade better than humans filled with emotions.

Moral of the story for you youngins' out there:  Buy and hold.  Maybe don't buy today at the peak of a fed induced 10+ year bull run and wait for a market correction in the next few years (ironic that I would be giving financial advice by the way), but when the opportunity strikes .... buy and hold.  Make smart investments.   Don't take dumb un-necessary risks.  Sometimes the boring stocks are the absolute best ones.

The stock market shouldn't be exciting.  It shouldn't be something that makes you lose sleep or feel anxiety.  It shouldn't be 'fun'.

Hope someone gains something from this post.",2020-02-01 14:19:40,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219090,1488 days 07:50:54.219090,414,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ex6quj/if_i_could_go_back_in_time_20_years_i_never_would/

Now could be the best time for Amazon (AMZN) to dramatically increase the size of its air fleet. That’s according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, who sees the depressed price of aircraft, coupled with the massive increase in demand for delivery services spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, as a golden opportunity for the ecommerce giant to pump cash into its Amazon Air division.

And while that would help Amazon increase its one-day shipping capabilities, it could also give it the firepower it needs to solidify its nascent third-party delivery business as a true competitor to the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS).",2020-05-27 22:21:33,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219094,1371 days 23:49:01.219094,216,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/grtq32/amazon_has_a_rare_opportunity_to_snatch_up_cheap/

hh0zmk,stocks,Las Vegas casinos are going to be in trouble - Nevada just doubled their previous record of virus cases,"**Please see my edit at the bottom of this post!**

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/florida-arizona-nevada-hit-daily-highs-for-covid-19-cases-idUSKBN23Y0MR

""Nevada disclosed 1,099 new cases, double its previous high.""

At the height of the pandemic for New York, in the second half of March, they were averaging about 9k cases a day. New York has a population of 19.4M people, meaning roughly 1 new case every day for every 2,160 people in New York in March. Nevada, with 3M people, set a record for themselves of 1 new case for every 2,700 people. And the numbers in Nevada are increasing fast. Nevada could pass New York's worst day in per capita terms in a week.

I just can't see the casinos there remaining open, and even if they do stay open, no one will want to visit from out of state.

**EDIT:** Turns out the overly big jump on June 26 was due to data from lab reports dated 23 and 24 June being included in the 26 June total. However, the brand-new numbers reported for today, June 27th are likely a new record even though weekends are usually lower numbers.

https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/news-release/public-health-update-covid-19-case-increase/

""After a review of the case data, it was determined the increase in reports was due to a delay in laboratory reporting. More than 240 of the cases reported were from laboratory reports dated June 23, and more than 380 were from reports dated June 24.""

wf87z3,stocks,"Shipping firm Maersk, a barometer for global trade, warns of weak demand and warehouses filling up","[AP Moller-Maersk](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMKBY) on Wednesday predicted a slowdown in global shipping container demand this year amid weakening consumer confidence and supply chain congestion.

The Danish shipping and logistics company — one of the world’s largest and a broad barometer for global trade — said it loaded 7.4% fewer containers onto ships in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2021, prompting it to revise the full-year outlook for its container business.

Maersk now expects demand to be at the lower end of its range, between -1% and 1% in 2022, as rising inflation and energy prices darken the global economic outlook.

“Geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation via higher energy prices continued to weigh on consumer sentiment and growth expectations,” the company [said in a statement.](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/08/03/maersk-continues-to-grow-logistics-business-and-deliver-record-results)

“Given this background, in 2022 global container demand is now expected to be at the lower end of the -1% to +1% forecasted range,” it said.

## Stockpiles build-up

Maersk warned that the slowdown was especially pronounced in Europe, where stockpiles have been building up at ports and in warehouses as consumer demand wanes.

Russia’s war in Ukraine and Covid-19 lockdowns in China have only exacerbated such congestion woes, it added.

“In Europe, supply chain congestion remained as retailers and manufacturers kept containers in ports and warehouses due to weak final demand. Port lockdowns in China due to the Covid-19 zero-tolerance policy as well as consequences from the war in Ukraine also caused strains in key areas of the logistics network,” the company said.",2022-08-03 14:35:14,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219118,574 days 07:35:20.219119,288,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wf87z3/shipping_firm_maersk_a_barometer_for_global_trade/
ryznm8,stocks,This killed day trading for me..,"I haven't told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about.  I had started day trading paper stocks. I was reading day trading books by reputable day traders, watching live YouTube traders and actually was doing pretty good. In 1 year, I had turned the original 10,000 paper money I started with into 140,000. It was like I couldn't lose. For every red day, I had 3 green days. I was doing everything by the book and it was really working.  
   
   So, not having any money, I took out a personal loan for 5k. Put 2k in the bank and 3k into my day trading platform. I was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me 5 years at 23%. I told him I'd pay it off in full within 6 months. 

   Now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst. A reason why a stock will go up. They also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than 5% so you don't lose everything if it drops. Well I started day trading for real and was doing only ok. I would make 250 dollars then lose 150 dollars. Lose 300 then make 200. I was about 50/50 red days and green days. My 3k was down to about 2,800 after a week. Then it happened.  I read a stock twit at 5am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on Amazon. I looked it up and it was true. I told myself I would buy 2k worth. When I looked up the price, it was only .88 a share!

   The bell rings and I buy like 2,200 shares. It instantly goes up about 6 percent and I'm getting excited. Then, literally as I'm setting my stop loss (not even 2 minutes into the session) it drops. Alot. Below where my stop was gonna be set. I'm down 100 so I'm like we'll shit. I go to set another stop but it falls so fast that I can't set it in time. I'm down 200 then 300 then 400 and I'm freaking out. I finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a 400 dollar loss. This was the first 5 minutes of the session. Over the next 20 minutes it dropped to .40 a share. I thought well at least I got out before it went that low. Upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news, I Ieft to work. I had about a 35 min drive and decided about 10 mins into it to check on that stock. It was 2.50 a share! The app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks, I could not perform any buy/sell action from the app and I was driving to work. I checked again 10 mins later, it was at 4.50 a share! I got to the supply house about 20 mins later and checked while I was waiting on parts. 7.00 a share. I couldn't stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at 12.35 a share I literally felt sick. The next day it fell a bit early but then ended at 17 dollars! 

   Over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of 34 dollars a share. Now I don't know if I would have held it to that point but I beat myself up for months thinking I lost 400 dollars when I could have made 60k. It completely killed my spirit. I started sucking at my trades. It only took a few months and another almost 2k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my 600 bucks I had left and put it in a different stock trading account, close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade.

   They say 84% of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year. I guess I was part of that statistic. I went from being on cloud 9 with my paper account for a year, just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months. Every time someone brings up ""yo man, you still doing the day trading thing"" I just lie and tell them no I don't have enough time to dedicate to it anymore. But really I think of the perfect trade that I knew would go up, that I sold for a loss and, unable to do anything, I watched it go up 3,500% and it still makes me physically queasy. This was 4 years ago. I am what they call in the business an emotional trader. Just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety. Thanks for reading my story. 100% true btw. Nothing in this is made up or exaggerated. Real prices, real time frames. I just can't remember the ticker. 
 
   It ended up falling to about 3 or 4 dollars a share over the next year, and yes I watched it for the next year but 2k into 26k in one day would have been great. 2k into 35k the next day would have been better.  Turning it into 60k would have been life changing for me at that time but I think what hurts the most is that I found that obscure twit. I did the research. I truly believed it would go up, I knew it would go up. Then I panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect. Thats worse than losing the money.


EDIT: ok so I found the stock ticker!!!..I was able to log into my tc2000 account from my browser and look at my trade history. it was OBLN. I had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but I did find one. The prices are totally different than what they were that day. They must have had some splits or reverse splits or something. 

   I also got a couple details wrong. I didn't buy 2,000 shares. That was actually a different stock. I yolo'd my whole 3,000 dollars and bought 3,448 shares at .87 each on May 23, 2019. Another detail I got wrong, It wasn't almost 4 years ago it was almost 3 years ago. I sold 2 minutes later at .57 a share. It wasn't a 400 dollar loss, it was a 600 dollar loss. According to the only chart I could find that recognized the ticker symbol, on May 23, 2019 it opened at 20.40, hit a high of 28.20, a low of 18.90 and closed at 20.40 a share, exactly the same as the open. Totally different than what my trade history says. There are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart. On tc2000 it is now listed as OBLN.OLD Also, my trade history is wonky and not correct. I bought all those shares, watched it drop and sold them. Then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day. According to Tc2000, I bought 3,448 shares at .87 which is correct but then it says I sold them all 2 minutes later for .84. This is not correct. It also shows me buying 4,000 shares the next day at .57, then selling 3,000 21 minutes later for .55 then selling the other 1,000 17 minutes after that for .57. None of that happened. I never traded it a second day. I bought at .87 then sold a few minutes later at either .55 or .57. It was one transaction on one day. Tc2000 was always a little funky and I grew to not like it all. I'm sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying I'm lying or this is fake or whatever. If those people would like, I can send them screen shots of my buy at .87 on the same day that the chart says it was 20.40. I wish it matched but I currently have both up on my computer and I can send them. I don't understand it either. But I found the ticker!!!

oyqr09,stocks,Biden to push for 50% electric vehicles by 2030,"President Biden is set to announce his aim for 50% electric vehicles by 2030. Yahoo Finance’s Rick Newman shares the details.

### Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: The Biden administration is setting ambitious targets to reduce the country's carbon footprint, calling for electric vehicles to make up half of all new US car sales by the end of this decade. Some climate activists, though, saying the goal doesn't address the urgency of the crisis. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman, who is following this story for us.

And Rick, you know, we're talking about 50% by the end of the decade. And yet, today, EVs only make up about 3% of new car sales. So how realistic is this?

RICK NEWMAN: It depends on what the government does, honestly. If the industry were just left to itself, I don't think there's any way we would get to 50% of new vehicle market share by 2030. The cars are still more expensive than gas-powered cars. There's still range issues. But the Biden administration plans to do a lot to incentivize people to buy these vehicles.

So there's going to be billions of dollars for new charging stations. So there will be charging stations, in theory, wherever you might need one. That's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that's now in Congress. Biden wants about $170 billion in addition to that. He wants new subsidies for anybody buying an electric vehicle, electrify school buses. He wants subsidies for building battery plants in the United States and all this kind of stuff.

So this-- these are the reasons that the auto industry really seems quite happy to go along with this. Because they're going to-- they think they're going to get so much funding from the federal government to help them reach this target. By the way, we should point out to everybody watching, this is a target not a requirement. There's no penalty for any automaker that does not get to 50% of all new vehicle sales being electric by 2030. That's just the goal.

AKIKO FUJITA: And Rick, you've also got some additional measures here laid out in that plan, including limits on tailpipe emissions. I mean, walk me through how significant of a bump that is. Because we all - there were standards set under the Obama administration. The Trump administration rolled that back. Where do things stand now?

RICK NEWMAN: We don't know exactly. Because Biden has not yet said what he plans to do on that. I mean, just the very briefest history here, Obama, in 2012, raised fuel efficiency standards really aggressively. That would have required about a 5% improvement in fuel economy every year. And then Trump came in, and he slashed that down to about a 1.5% improvement in fuel economy every year.

Now the reporting is that Biden is going to split the difference basically. He's going to raise fuel economy standards above where Trump left them to what would amount to about 3.7% increase in fuel economy every year. But that- they have not announced that yet. And that takes a long time. That is the-- that's changing a federal regulation, which has to go through months and months of review and things like that.

And I think one of the things we're probably going to hear the Biden administration say, well, yeah, his guideline for fuel economy is not as aggressive as Obama's was back in 2012. But if we have all these new electric vehicles on the road, that is something that we didn't have really back in 2012. So that should make it easier to reach the 3.7% annual increase, or whatever it turns out to be. But that is down the road still.

AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Rick Newman, staying on top of the details. Of course, you can read his story on YahooFinance.com as well. Thanks so much for that, Rick.",2021-08-05 20:13:08,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219137,937 days 01:57:26.219138,593,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oyqr09/biden_to_push_for_50_electric_vehicles_by_2030/
me6ezj,stocks,Drinking and Trading don’t mix. I accidentally bought equity warrants instead of ordinary stock. How do I make money of of this mistake?,"Title says it all. Had a few too many drinks of liquid courage and bought 50 shares of Cresco Labs Equity Warrants (CRLWF) instead of the ordinary shares (CRLBF). I used Fidelity to buy the shares resulting in a fee of $100 (bought 30 and then 20 and didnt notice the $50 fee for each.) So my cost basis is around $8 while the listing price for CRLWF is around $6. 

If I sell now, I get hit with another $50 transaction fee, plus lose the $100 and some change. The warrants expire in September of 2022. The strike price is around $9.90. 

Is there anyway I can come out of this by either breaking even or making a profit? I’m pretty confused about how to exercise warrants, and how people even make money of equity warrants. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

And no need to call me a moron....i’m very well aware if that. Thank you again!",2021-03-27 04:14:08,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219142,1068 days 17:56:26.219143,284,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me6ezj/drinking_and_trading_dont_mix_i_accidentally/

yg7bv9,stocks,Twitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8," 

Twitter's stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This comes a day after Elon Musk completed [the company's takeover after a lengthy ordeal](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) late Thursday. Incidentally, the delisting is taking place on the same date as the U.S. midterm elections.

""The New York Stock Exchange hereby notifies the SEC of its intention to remove the entire class of the stated securities from listing and registration on the Exchange at the opening of business on November 08, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2 (a),"" the [filing reads](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/876661/000087666122000890/0000876661-22-000890.txt).

It also indicated that [the merger](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) between Twitter and Musk's subsidiary X Holdings II, Inc. was complete. Musk's X Holdings I, Inc. will now own all the stock of the social network.

""The merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Elon R. Musk became effective on October 27, 2022. Each share of Twitter, Inc. Common Stock was exchanged for USD 54.20 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Exchange also notifies the Securities and Exchange Commission that as a result of the above-indicated conditions this security was suspended from trading before market open on October 28, 2022.""

At the time of writing, Twitter's stock was trading at $53.70 — slightly lower than Musk's buying price of $54.20. Twitter won't have to make quarterly disclosures like its monthly active users or its earnings as a private company. But financial institutions that have lent money to Musk will pressure the billionaire to make the company profitable.

The social media company will likely form a new board after the current members will dissolve. Musk will have to also pick a new executive team, as one of his first steps after taking over was to [fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, general counsel Sean Edgett and head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-fired-top-twitter-execs-including-ceo-reports-say/). Musk is [likely to assume the CEO position](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/28/elon-musk-will-reportedly-take-the-ceo-role-after-exec-exodus/) for the time being, but he might hand it over to someone else in the long run.

A report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/twitter-s-twtr-top-bosses-poised-to-exit-with-100-million-as-musk-takes-over) noted that Agrawal is set to receive nearly $50 million while Segal and Gadde will get $37 million and $17 million each as part of the severance package.

11gdduf,stocks,The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived,"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/inverse-cramer-etf-is-coming-to-the-real-world

An enterprising and clearly meme-savvy fund manager out there, Tuttle Capital Management, has actually filed prospectuses for two Cramer-tracking funds:

- The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM)
- The Long Cramer ETF (LJIM)

I'm not surprised. Tuttle Capital is known for its hilarious yet strangely effective ETF lineup. Case in point, their earlier Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK) that bet against Cathie Wood and her funds is still up 73% year-to-date. 

**How the Inverse Cramer ETF might work**

Make no mistake, SJIM and LJIM will be actively managed funds. Although Index One was able to construct an Inverse Cramer tracking index, the actual operations of a Cramer-based fund would be significantly more complex. This is not your vanilla buy-and-hold index fund. 

According to Tuttle Capital, both ETFs will hold 20-25 Cramer picks in an equally weighted allocation. Because Cramer often makes his picks live on TV (or via tweets), the fund will likely have significant turnover to maintain low tracking error with Cramer's recommendations. I'm curious to see if there will be large capital gains distributions every year due to this. 

SJIM is the more interesting fund in my opinion and will require some intricacies to carry out its daily inverse exposure target. This will likely necessitate shorting or the use of total return swaps. I'm curious to see if the team at Tuttle plans on using options given their complexity and susceptibility to time decay and changes in implied volatility. 

In many ways, SJIM is basically a long-short alternative fund. If Cramer is bullish a pick, the fund shorts it. If Cramer is bearish on a pick, the fund goes long on it. Buying the fund means basically betting against Cramer in the most explicit and hilarious of ways.

**Benefits and risks of SJIM ETF**

The premise behind SJIM is theoretically sound and can be boiled down to one observation: ""the average stock picker performs horribly .""Stock-picking is extremely difficult to pull off consistently. Everyone is a genius in a bull market, but during bear markets like these, the average stock picker tends to trail a simple index fund significantly. 

Case in point, studies have found that just a handful of stocks (86 in total) account for half of the total stock market's return in the last 90 years, with 96% underperforming risk-free Treasury Bills. Another study found that a blindfolded monkey could beat most stock pickers. Unless you think he’s a prophet with his stock picks, betting against Cramer is like betting against any stock picker. 

What is the bull case for SJIM then? In a nutshell, the fund would likely outperform if just over half of Cramer's picks were wrong in the short term. The inverse exposure will likely be reset daily like most inverse ETFs on the market. Thus, the best-case scenario is a sudden, volatile movement against one of Cramer's recommendations that the fund trades in and out of. 

Most inverse funds have high negative carry due to the positive expected returns of the underlying, volatility drag, and high expense ratios. SJIM could feasibly post a positive long-term return if Cramer was consistently wrong with his picks over the short term, the fund doesn't employ leverage (which amplifies volatility drag), and keeps expense ratios low enough.  
If you're dead set on betting against Cramer, SJIM might be one of the safer ways to do so. Otherwise, you'll have to actively manage dozens of positions, keep up to date with Cramer's news segments and Twitter, use margin to sell stocks short, or fiddle with options. At least with an ETF, your maximum risk is limited to your total investment.",2023-03-02 20:41:13,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219177,363 days 01:29:21.219177,216,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11gdduf/the_inverse_jim_cramer_etf_has_officially_arrived/

ztzzhp,stocks,Parted with TSLA this week after holding for 5 years. Here's why.,"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.

Being a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' 

However, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole ""but Elon isn't Tesla!"" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. 

I do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think ""Tesla"" you cannot escape thinking ""Elon Musk."" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. 

Now, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. 

A mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: ""Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."" 

Where is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?

Often times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how ""dumb"" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  

The sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. 

I'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to <$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.

My thoughts on being a TSLA investor is what my mother used to say: it's been real, it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun.",2022-12-24 02:56:55,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219200,431 days 19:13:39.219201,383,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ztzzhp/parted_with_tsla_this_week_after_holding_for_5/
m1owvy,stocks,Roblox reference share price set at $45 ahead NYSE debut,"The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday set a reference price of $45 for shares of U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp on the eve of its public market debut, implying a market value for the company of around $30 billion. San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading ""pop"" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier. U.S. demand for video games has surged as consumers seek home entertainment while living under lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. - Reuters

> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House’s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.
*****
> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.
*****
> “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”
*****
> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
> “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
> “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.
*****
> # Infrastructure plan
> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
> “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”
*****
> Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”
*****
> “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.
*****
> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
> # Rotation
> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
> “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
> “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”
*****
> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
> “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

> # Historic Year for the S&P 500

> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”

> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.

> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).

> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks.",2021-03-27 12:51:30,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219216,1068 days 09:19:04.219217,147,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/med6uw/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/
k0t986,stocks,My Investing Roadmap,"So you want to begin buying stocks?  I’m 33 years old, and begin investing during college (more than 10 years ago).  I’ve learned a ton, and built a substantial portfolio over the 13ish years since I began.  I’ve also done a lot of dumb stuff over the years, and learned a lot of expensive lessons. To me, this is the roadmap to begin investing.  



***Step 1) Be sure you’re financially ready to begin investing.***
In my view, building an investment portfolio is like framing a house.  This is an incredibly important step in your financial security, but needs to be done after you’ve laid the foundation.  I highly recommend Dave Ramsey’s baby steps (I consider my stock account baby step 4).  Read this and watch his youtube.  Bonus points if you can answer callers questions before Dave does on his radio show.  Another great resource is /r/financialindependence .  your stock portfolio should not be money you need in the next 5 years, preferably 20 years.  Put it in there, and don’t take it out.


***Step 2) understand your goals the first year (Year 0-1)***
In the first year of investing you have three main goals.

 
•	**Don’t chicken out.**  Pulling the trigger is the hardest part.  You make your first buy then you open your account 30 times the same day to see how it’s performing.  You’re probably doing this not because you’re afraid of losing money, but you’re afraid of failure or looking stupid.  You might tell yourself, if I learn to do research I can increase my chances of being right. This is dumb.  The most important thing is to start the trip.  Think to yourself, if you need to travel across the country by road and your options are to take the minivan you have now, or wait 3 days until you can get a sports car. Which is a smarter move?  Get your ass in the minivan.

•	**Don’t commit a financial blunder.**  For any of you who play any competitive video game with a ladder you know there is a commonality across all of them.  To climb out of the bottom 50% of any ladder, all you have to do is not commit blunders.  You don’t have to do anything fancy, you don’t have to be flashy, just don’t fuck up.  This is 100% true in the stock market as well.  This means you don’t have to do any financial analysis your first year.  Keep everything as simple as you can to start.  There is still plenty to learn from investing in an ETF the first year, and the third bullet will take enormous amounts of energy.

•	**Learn to manage your emotions.**  The first year is an emotional whirlwind no matter how much you’re investing.  Your primary goal above everything else is to learn to act calmly.  If you check your account value every day, you’re training your brain to inject dopamine every time your account goes up.  This is really, really bad.  You’re going to have a bad day in the market, and your brain doesn’t get the dopamine hit that It’s used to. This leads to panic selling and grief.  If you learn this skill early, I’m 100% convinced your set for life.  The rest is easy.
The other part of this bullet is Reddit is the Instagram of stock market gains.  People only post what they want you to see.  Only the best get upvoted.  This gives us a warped sense of reality, and what our expectations should be in investing.  Don’t get caught in the hype. Don’t YOLO.

***Step 3) what do I do after that? (Year 2-5)***
Holy shit, if you make it here, the fun begins. If you can master your emotions you can then begin to nurture this hobby.  Continue regular contributions to your account. Once it’s in the stock account, don’t think of it as spending money anymore, it’s now investment money.  Find elements of the stock market that interest you and learn more about it.  

If I were to give one thing that you should begin learning now and have down cold it would be “What changes a stock’s price and how does that relate to the value of a company?”

-understand what market capitalization is, an how it relates to a stock price.  What financial tricks can a company play, and how will that affect the stock price, but not the market cap? To me, this is critical to understand.

-be able to know the rough market cap if any major public company you come in contact with on a regular basis. 

-Time value of money.  You don’t need to know the math, just the concept.  How this relates to opportunity cost. 

-understand how earnings and earnings calls actually affect stock price.  You don’t need to actually monitor these, but just understand how earnings and earnings expectations relate.

Once you get that down you’ll find other areas of stocks/ finance that interest you. Do you like to do financial analysis? Learn that.  Do you like to think big picture? Invest your time there.

***Become an investor, not a trader.  Investors are “good business collectors”.***

As you contribute more money into your account, begin picking up individual companies.  Your contributions should be retentively small compared to your overall portfolio.  If it’s not, then contribute more to your ETF.  For the next 5 years, commit to having no more than ½ of your portfolio in individual companies.  This will mitigate risk, and allow you to learn about individual companies and how to look at them.  My suggested method for finding your first few individual companies are “What industries are coming in the 3-5 years, and what companies are the best positioned to be there”.  Only do that for industries you understand (unless you’re a doctor don’t mess with bio-tech).  Some of the meme stocks, are actually great for small individual stock pickups in this stage.  Don’t invest in penny stocks (or anything with a market cap under $2B) until you know what you’re doing.  I’ve lost way more money in shit like this than anything.  Also, don’t fall for value traps (moderate or shitty companies selling for a deep discount).  It might work every once in awhile, but that’s not our game.

At the end of the day, keep this as simple as possible.  If something doesn't feel right, dont do it.  I hope this gives you the push you need to get started, and help someone out there.",2020-11-25 14:36:09,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219229,1190 days 07:34:25.219230,283,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k0t986/my_investing_roadmap/

Younger folks-  Now is a once in a decade time for you.  Over your investing life you might see something like we saw in 2022 maybe five to eight times.  Take advantage of it.

Four basic concepts you have to remember if you want to be successful in the long run in the stock market.

The turtle always wins over the hare -- slowly but surely. Don't buy junk -- Most unprofitable tech and all Crypto falls into this category. Except with your casino money.

Dollar cost average -- buy some every month regardless of what the market is doing. When the market was like 2022 and probably 2023 buy as much as you possibly can on a big down day.

Diversify -- good cheap, broad market ETFs from Vanguard or Fidelity are great.

Let physics or whatever heavenly name you want to call it be your friend -- ""COMPOUND INTEREST"" has no equal, except lack of time. A young person can get rich in 30-35 years if they follow these rules.

And, If you are younger, hope the market stays down for years.

lji5zb,stocks,Investing a year and what I learned the hard way with one stock.,"Hi guys. Glad to be here. Sitting here bored on a Saturday night, I wanted to see how much I actually invested, bought, sold, and profited in on stock that IPOd in July. I knew it was one of my main money makers, but wasn't exactly sure. 

  
Here is my breakdown.

TLDR: If I actually kept longer than a few months I'd be sitting real pretty and will change my investing techniques and rules for myself.  
Ticker: FTHM  
Realty stock/IPO

I bought a total of 4053.949 shares for $75,033.33  
I sold a total of 3923.166 shares for $91,758.79  
Currently own 120.78 shares at $6,552.52

That would put me at a profit of $16,725.46 realized and $6,552.52 unrealized for a total of $23277.98 in the past 8 months. 

Worst part. IF.. I kept the 4,000 shares.... at $54.25.... $217,000.

I can't look back and wallow..... but I can learn from this.

ice312,stocks,A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy. (My Renewable portfolio with DD),"I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. 

---------------------------

I'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. 

------------------------------

Tesla (TSLA)     (511% gain) 

Most of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder 

My bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.

--------------------------------------

Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)         (91.4% gain)

https://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf

Vestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. 

--------------------------------

First Solar (FSLR).    (24% gain)

First Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. 

My bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign companies. 

----------------------------------

Jinko Solar (JKS)         (22% gain)

https://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119

Jinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. 

--------------------------

Canadian Solar (CSIQ)           (27.5% gain)

http://investors.canadiansolar.com/events

Canadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing & project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. 
They trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. 

My bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. 

--------------------------

SolarEdge (SEDG)           (126% gain)

https://investors.solaredge.com/

SolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. 

My bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage & EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. 

--------------------------

TPI composites (TPIC).            (70.55% gain)
  
https://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf

TPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex & Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.

-------------------

Enphase Energy (ENPH)        (46% gain)

https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9

Enphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. 

My bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). 

-----------------------

Brookfield Renewables (BEPC).          (12% gain)

https://bep.brookfield.com/~/media/Files/B/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/events-and-presentations/bep-investor-brochure-q1-2020-vf.pdf

Brookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. 

My bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide me with exposure to hydroelectric energy. 

--------------------------------

NOTE: I'm 19 years old and have a 5-10 year+ timeline for holding/buying into all of these companies

yqzgdk,stocks,Amazon Becomes World’s First Public Company to Lose $1 Trillion in Market Value,"Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. 

Shares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. 

While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. 
The e-commerce giant has shed $1 trillion in market value
  
The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago.",2022-11-09 23:48:22,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219271,475 days 22:22:12.219271,224,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yqzgdk/amazon_becomes_worlds_first_public_company_to/
wyakwv,stocks,"Fed’s Powell, in blunt remarks at Jackson Hole, says bringing down inflation will cause pain to households and businesses","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the spotlight on the central bank’s Jackson Hole retreat to deliver a blunt message that the Fed will keep at the job of bringing inflation down until it is done and that the fight will be costly in terms of jobs and economic growth. “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” Powell said in his speech to the central bankers and economists gathered at the base of the Grand Tetons.

“Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he added. Fed Chairmen often give the opening address to the Fed’s Jackson Hole retreat in late August. While many of the speeches have been consequential for markets, they have also tended to be long and wide-ranging. Powell broke the mold with his speech Friday with a short six-page speech.

In it, Powell drove home the point that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” “We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” Powell said.

On worries about a possible recession, Powell said that he sees “strong underlying momentum” in the economy. Powell said he was pleased with the lower July inflation readings but quickly added “a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.” At the moment, “high inflation has continued to spread through the economy,”

Powell kept the door open for a 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike in September, saying that “another unusually large increase could be appropriate” next month. But he said the debate over whether to hike by 0.75 percentage point for the third straight meeting or slow to a half percentage point increase would depend on the “totality” of the economic data between now and the Fed’s Sept. 20 meeting. At some point, the Fed won’t be able to keep raising by 0.75 percentage point moves, he added. Wall Street had viewed Powell’s last press conference in July as dovish. Analysts said that this view came when Powell described the Fed’s benchmark interest rate setting – in a range of 2.25%-2.5% – as “neutral.” Perhaps in a nod to the markets view, Powell said in his speech Friday that neutral “was not a place to stop or pause” rate hikes.

xeiwl9,stocks,"Balance Sheet is $9,000,000,000,000 and Fractional Reserve Banking Has Ended","Obviously there has been a lot of talk about the Federal Funds Rate decisions and Quantitative Tightening/Easing, but it's been troubling why more people aren't talking about the Fed balance sheet.  

Back in 2008 when Bernake/Paulsen agreed on terms and congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act it was agreed that the Fed would buy $700b in mortgage back securities from the banks which led to the Act being nicknamed the ""bank bailout of 2008.""  

Also at the time it was said (by everyone) that eventually those emergency policies would need to be rolled back. FOMC member Charles Evans said ""once the economy recovers and financial conditions stabilize, the Fed will reduce the size of the balance sheet.""  

Since then, not only was the balance sheet not reduced, the total has ballooned to $9 trillion (43% of GDP). And in 2016 Bernake himself wrote a paper completely changing the original opinion and saying that they would just grow the balance sheet infinitely:  
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/09/02/should-the-fed-keep-its-balance-sheet-large/  

Obviously people can see the issue here, what was once considered a $700 billion bank bailout has quietly become a $9,000,000,000,000 balance sheet and the S&P 500 has been directly 1:1 correlated with the growth of this ""balance sheet"" amount:  
https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/posts/2021/07/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php  

Also at the height of Covid in March 2020 the Fed decided to abandon factional reserve banking completely, setting the reserve requirements to 0:  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm  

So now that we are seeing persistent and extreme inflation isn't this absolutely a case of taxation without representation?  The banks have given themselves $9,000,000,000,000 which required no congressional action and now people are paying for it in the form of higher prices on goods, services, housing, transportation, and energy etc.  

Why aren't more people talking about this, when TARP passed in 2008 it was headline news.
  
  
-———————————————————————  
EDIT: 
Seems like some people are noticing a conflation of TARP and the balance sheet so wanted to clarify.  Both TARP and Quantitative Easing were initiated at the same time at the end of 2008.  TARP was the fiscal policy (by congress/the Treasury) and Quantitative Easing was the monetary policy (by the Fed buying MBS).  

While TARP ended, Quantitative Easing continued and has since ballooned on the Fed balance sheet to $9 trillion dollars. It was initially thought that normalization (balance sheet run off) would occur but that hasn't happened. And Bernake's paper linked above as well as a book he released in May of this year (21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19) suggests that the balance sheet will never be normalized.  Money on the Fed balance sheet went into bank reserves and when combined with lowering reserve requirements seems like a never ending infinite bank bailout.",2022-09-15 01:07:07,2024-02-28 22:10:34.219280,531 days 21:03:27.219280,360,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xeiwl9/balance_sheet_is_9000000000000_and_fractional/
otm5c9,stocks,"Robinhood IPO Prices at $38 a Share; at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand","Robinhood Markets Inc. priced its initial public offering at $38 a share, at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand for its highly anticipated debut.

The price chosen by the company and its underwriters is at the bottom of the range of $38 to $42 a share they had been targeting. It pegs Robinhood’s valuation at about $32 billion, far higher than the nearly $12 billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers.

Robinhood has said it and some executives would sell 55 million shares, so the offering should yield more than $2 billion.

The price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors, who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation Robinhood sought, as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful first-day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter.

Next up for Robinhood is its trading debut, which the company will make Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol HOOD. It is a markedly different debut than the traditional IPO. While most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their IPOs, Robinhood sold a big chunk of its IPO shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to IPOs before they start trading.

That high individual investor allocation is an X factor for Thursday’s debut. The large chunk in the hands of individual investors-—as well as the buzz around Robinhood by other individual investors who didn’t receive shares in the IPO—represents a wildcard, and some traders at banks that underwrite big IPOs say it is hard to predict how that will impact the stock at the open.

Robinhood’s decision earlier this year to stop users from buying meme stocks like GameStop Corp. GME -5.28% during the height of the frenzy for such shares rankled some investors and could prompt some to eschew the offering.

Past IPOs in which a significant percentage of shares were allocated to individual investors have struggled. In 2012, Facebook Inc. FB 1.49% sold about 25% of its IPO to individual investors. The stock closed slightly above its $38 IPO price in a rocky first day of trading before tumbling the next day, in part because many individual investors received more stock than they wanted. It took more than a year for Facebook to close above its IPO price again. In 2006, Vonage Holdings Corp. VG 0.56% allowed longtime customers to buy into its IPO. Its stock also wobbled in early trading.

The Robinhood listing is another landmark in a historic boom in IPOs as a rising stock market and hearty investor appetite entice a slew of successful private companies to shift to public ownership. Some 20 companies are going public each week this year, according to Dealogic. Traditional IPOs had raised more than $98 billion as of Tuesday, on the cusp of surpassing all of 1999 and 2000 as the biggest year ever for U.S.-listed IPOs.

In the nearly seven years since it launched its app, Robinhood has gone from a tiny startup to one of the largest U.S. retail brokerages. The firm, which popularized zero-commission trades, says its mission is to democratize investing. It is a philosophy Robinhood reinforced Saturday by hosting a live-streamed roadshow presentation for individual investors.

As of the end of June, the firm had 22.5 million funded accounts and its users held about $100 billion of assets on the Robinhood platform.

The company went viral earlier this year when millions of amateur investors downloaded its app to participate in the explosive rally in meme stocks like GameStop. The breakout moment nearly broke Robinhood, as the company had to restrict purchases of some high-flying stocks and raise billions of dollars in emergency capital to meet regulatory requirements that kicked in because of the increased trading volumes.

Robinhood bounced back and continued to attract new users, but, more recently, it flagged that its growth is slowing. The company said in a securities filing last week that it expects its third-quarter revenue to fall relative to the second quarter, partially due to decreased trading activity.

Its popularity has brought increased regulatory scrutiny too. In the past nine months, the company has agreed to pay more than $130 million to settle investigations into a range of its business practices. There could be more on the way: Robinhood disclosed this week that it got a new request for information from Wall Street’s self-regulatory body, Finra.

ixyrff,stocks,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech","Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.

On Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.

Due partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.

Those who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.

Since its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.

Tesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.

Remaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.

The stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. 

Expecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:

“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”

Cannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.

Shares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.

 The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.4 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.1 percent in August, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.2 percent before seasonal adjustment. 

 Increases in the shelter, food, and medical care indexes were the largest of many contributors to the monthly seasonally adjusted all items increase. These increases were partly offset by a 4.9-percent decline in the gasoline index. The food index continued to rise, increasing 0.8 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.7 percent. The energy index fell 2.1 percent over the month as the gasoline index declined, but the natural gas and electricity indexes increased.

 The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in September, as it did in August. The indexes for shelter, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, new vehicles, household furnishings and operations, and education were among those that increased over the month. There were some indexes that declined in September, including those for used cars and trucks, apparel, and communication. 

 The all items index increased 8.2 percent for the 12 months ending September, a slightly smaller figure than the 8.3-percent increase for the period ending August. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.6 percent over the last 12 months.

The bank’s global investment committee expects a stock-market pullback of 10% to 15% before the end of the year, she wrote.

“The strength of major U.S. equity indexes during August and the first few days of September, pushing to yet more daily and consecutive new highs in the face of concerning developments, is no longer constructive in the spirit of ‘climbing a wall of worry,’” said Shalett. “Consider taking profits in index funds,” she said, as stock benchmarks have dismissed “resurgent COVID-19 hospitalizations, plummeting consumer confidence, higher interest rates and significant geopolitical shifts.” 

She suggested rebalancing investment portfolios toward “high-quality cyclicals,” particularly stocks in the financial sector, while seeking “consistent dividend-payers in consumer services, consumer staples and health care.”

12u12hf,stocks,Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

udu25j,stocks,U.S. economic growth rate unexpectedly declined in the first quarter by 1.4%,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/us-q1-gdp-growth.html

Gross domestic product unexpectedly declined 1.4% in the first quarter, marking an abrupt reversal for an economy coming off its best performance since 1984, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

The negative growth rate missed even the subdued Dow Jones estimate of a 1% gain for the quarter.


A plethora of factors conspired to weigh against growth during the first three months of 2022, which fell off a cliff following the 6.9% gain to close out last year.

Rising omicron infections to start the year hampered activity across the board, while inflation surging at a level not seen since the early 1980s and the Russia invasion of Ukraine also contributed to the economic stasis.

Prices increased sharply during the quarter, with the price index for gross domestic purchases surging 7.8% in the three-month period, following a 7% gain in the fourth quarter of 2021.

While recession expectations on Wall Street remain low, there’s further trouble ahead: In an effort to combat burgeoning price increases, the Federal Reserve plans to enact a series of rate hikes aimed at slowing growth further.

Current market pricing indicates the equivalent of 10 quarter-percentage-point interest rate moves that would take the Fed’s benchmark interest rate to about 2.75% by the end of the year. That comes after two years of near-zero rates aimed at allowing a recovery from the steepest recession in U.S. history.

Along with that, the Fed has halted its monthly bond-buying program aimed at keeping rates low and money flowing through the economy. The Fed will start shrinking its current bond holdings as soon as next month, slowly at first then ultimately at a pace expected to hit as high as $95 billion a month.

While economists still largely expect the U.S. to skirt an outright recession, risks are rising.

Goldman Sachs sees about a 35% chance of negative growth a year from now. In a forecast that is an outlier on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank sees the chance of a “significant recession” hitting the economy in late 2023 and early 2024, the result of a Fed that will have tighten much more to tamp down inflation than forecasters currently anticipate.

That all comes after a year in which GDP rose at a 5.7% pace, the fastest since 1984. While consumer expenditures, which account for nearly 70% of the U.S. economy, drove growth in the first half of 2021, an inventory rebuild from the depleted pandemic levels accounted for almost all the growth in the final two quarters of the year.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $100 million to customers and $90 million in penalties. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay $60 million in fines.

18l73hp,stocks,Japan’s Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel in $14.9 billion deal,"Japan’s Nippon Steel
 said on Monday it would buy U.S. Steel
 in a deal valued at $14.9 billion including debt, months after the steelmaker put itself up for sale.

The per-share offer of $55 represents a premium of about 40% to U.S. Steel’s Friday’s close and 142% compared to the stock’s closing price before the company announced a strategic review process on Aug. 11.

U.S. Steel’s shares rose about 27% in premarket trading.

Nippon, the world’s No.4 steelmaker, sees the U.S. as a growth market that can help to offset declining demand in Japan, the Nikkei daily, which earlier reported the deal, said.

Nippon has secured financing commitments for the deal and expects it will enable the company to move toward 100 million tonnes of global crude steel capacity.

All of U. S. Steel’s commitments with its employees, including all collective bargaining agreements in place with its unions, will be honored, Nippon said.

In the middle of August, U.S. Steel launched a formal review process, after rebuffing a $7.3 billion offer from rival Cleveland-Cliffs.

While Cliffs continued to participate in the sale process, steelmaking giant ArcelorMittal was also considering an offer, Reuters reported in August.

Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel’s shares had suffered after several quarters of falling revenue and profit, making it an attractive takeover target for rivals looking to add a maker of steel used by the automobile industry.

U.S. Steel also supplies to the renewable energy industry and stands to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides tax credits and other incentives for such projects, something that attracted suitors.

Companies including U.S. Steel are also set for a strong start to 2024 as steel prices spike following a resolution of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union strike against the Detroit Three automakers.

g3odl6,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

yfwujj,stocks,Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard.,"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP?

It is so silly.   Why didn't anyone say ""Market up the last 5 days due to Omicron variant"" ?

Heat wave!  Climate change!  Market goes down.   Ooops, when that was the news, the market went up.   Condo collapse!  Market goes up.   Europe flooding!  Market goes down.  Nope, it went up.

Omicron variant has been in the news for weeks, and NOW the market goes down because of Omicron ?   Maybe yesterday the market went up because of Omicron.  Just as stupid.

w9eymy,stocks,Top Federal Reserve officials say they misread inflation and now plan to correct the course,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/top-federal-reserve-officials-say-they-misread-inflation-and-now-plan-to-correct-the-course/ar-AA101rIz?li=BBnbfcL)

 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also acknowledged the misdiagnosis coming from her own department, and that of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

""Both of us could have probably used a better word than 'transitory,'"" she told senators in June when asked about their remarks about inflation last year and their slow response to price pressures.

Top officials at the Federal Reserve were seeing inflation data come in very hot for months before policymakers moved to wind down monetary policies that were stimulating the economy.

 It's the Fed's task to tame inflation that is running at a pace not seen in four decades. To do so, it has been hiking interest rates at a fast pace.

Reining in inflation may take more aggressive monetary policy moves than the central bank has embraced in recent years, according to economists like Judd Cramer. His research indicates that the Fed may need to hike rates to levels not seen in decades to force rising prices into retreat.

""If inflation is going to be high and remain higher, that means that the neutral rate in the economy is also going to be higher because the price of goods are going up,"" he said to CNBC.

A June survey of inflation expectations from the New York Federal Reserve suggests the price hikes aren't over yet. The group predicts that by June 2023, prices will have risen approximately 6.8% from their current levels.

Maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment are the Fed's top responsibilities. Jobs appear plentiful in the U.S., which may give the central bank cover to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace through 2023.

The Federal Reserve was contacted for comment but is in a media blackout before the expected rate announcement later today.",2022-07-27 13:35:19,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178070,581 days 08:35:17.178070,530,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9eymy/top_federal_reserve_officials_say_they_misread/
hiwzgo,stocks,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.","*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

uavfl8,stocks,"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation","https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising

The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.

* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.

Although the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.",2022-04-24 14:02:48,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178079,675 days 08:07:48.178079,337,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uavfl8/google_meta_and_others_will_have_to_explain_their/

xhczwt,stocks,Wall Street is torn on whether the stock market will crash or soar 20% ahead of next week's Fed meeting. Here's where 6 experts stand.,"What do you think?   

# The Bears

**1. Ray Dalio: Expect a 20% sell-off in the stock market if rates keep rising.**

""With inflation well above what people and central banks want and the unemployment rate low, it's obvious that inflation is the targeted problem, so it's obvious that the central banks should tighten monetary policy. Everything will flow from that,"" Dalio said on Wednesday.

""I estimate that a rise in rates from where they are to about 4.5% will produce about a 20% negative impact on equity prices,"" Dalio said.

**2. Scott Minerd (Guggenheim CIO): A 20% decline in the S&P 500 could happen by mid-October.**

""It's really stark to see the price-to-earnings ratio where it is... given where seasonals are, and how far out of line we are historically with where the p/e is, we should see a really sharp adjustment in prices very fast,"" Minerd said last week.

""It appears people are ignoring the macro backdrop, monetary policy backdrop, which would basically indicate that the bear market is intact. We may very well already be in a recession... with YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&P 500 trading at \~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October,"" Minerd said.

**3. Jeff Gundlach (DoubleLine Capital founder): The credit market suggests both the economy and stock market are in trouble.**

""The action of the credit market is consistent with economic weakness and stock market trouble. I think you have to start becoming more bearish,"" Gundlach said on Tuesday, adding that he agrees with Scott Minerd's call that stocks can fall 20% soon.

""You always want to own stocks, but I'm a little on the lighter side...buy long-term Treasurys, because the deflation risk — in spite of the fact that the narrative today is exactly the opposite — the deflation risk is much higher today that it's been for the past two years,"" Gundlach said. Gundlach believes the Fed should hike interest rates by just 25 basis points next week.

# The Bulls

**1. Tom Lee (Fundstrat founder): Inflation has already peaked and that means you should buy stocks.**

""Even for those in the 'inflationista' camp or even the 'we are in a long-term bear' camp, the fact is, if headline CPI has peaked, the June 2022 equity lows should be durable,"" Lee said on Friday.

August's higher-than-expected CPI report ""does not mean stocks have to break below the June lows,"" Lee said, as he reiterated his view that S&P 500 will rally more than 20% to new highs by year-end.

**2. Jeremy Siegel (UPenn Wharton professor): Inflation is falling and whoever wanted to get out of stocks already has.**

""It seems like everyone that wants to be out of the market is out, and everyone that wants to be tactical is short. Therefore the surprises are going to be to the upside... when everyone has sold, only the buyers are left, and the shorts are exposed,"" Siegel said on Monday.

Siegel said if the Fed says rates will be higher for longer, ""That would be a policy mistake. I think they're going to look at the economy, and I hope they understand what the statistics are and what on the ground inflation is.""

**3. Marko Kolanovic (JP Morgan Chief Global Strategist): The stock market will rally as inflation resolves itself.**

""Given the lag it takes for rate hikes to work through the system, and with just one month before very important US elections, we believe it would be a mistake for the Fed to increase risk of a hawkish policy error and endanger market stability,"" Kolanovic said on Monday.

""Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus, and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,"" Kolanovic said.",2022-09-18 10:19:08,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178098,528 days 11:51:28.178098,495,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xhczwt/wall_street_is_torn_on_whether_the_stock_market/

sh88j5,stocks,Sony to buy videogame developer Bungie in $3.6 billion deal,"
Text from Bloomberg article:

Sony Group Corp. is purchasing Bungie Inc., the U.S. video game developer behind the popular Destiny franchise, for $3.6 billion to bolster its stable of game-making studios. 

The deal announced on Monday is the third significant video-game acquisition announced this month, following Microsoft Corp.’s purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion two weeks ago and Take Two Interactive Corp. snagging mobile game leader Zynga Inc. on Jan. 10. Buying Bungie will give Sony one of the most popular first-person shooter games to compete with the massive Call of Duty series, which Sony’s main rival now owns through Activision.

Microsoft is committed to releasing at least the next three Call of Duty games on Sony’s PlayStation, Bloomberg News has reported. But eventually Microsoft could decide to take the series exclusively to its Xbox console and Windows computers, and Sony may see Destiny as its response.

Sony is a regular acquirer of video game studios, though Bungie is by far its largest of the past decade. The Japanese entertainment and technology giant typically buys less established studios and enhances them with marketing and development resources, as it did for Naughty Dog and Guerrilla Games. Sony also holds minority stakes in some bigger game companies, such as Epic Games Inc., the maker of Fortnite. In recent years, Sony has made some smaller acquisitions, notably Burbank, California-based Insomniac Games in 2019 and Finland’s Housemarque, aiming to bolster its library of PlayStation exclusives. 

While Microsoft has focused on packing its subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, full of games big and small, Sony’s blueprint is to develop large blockbusters and keeping them exclusive to PlayStation -- a strategy that helped the PlayStation 4 sell more than 116 million units, well ahead of the Xbox.

Bellevue, Washington-based Bungie, founded in 1991, helped put the Xbox on the map with the Halo franchise and was purchased by Microsoft in 2000. In 2007, the studio negotiated its independence and spun out from Microsoft to work on its next big thing, Destiny, with Activision. That relationship ended in 2019 and Bungie began self-publishing and operating Destiny independently.

Destiny functions differently than many other franchises. Rather than release a regular cadence of sequels, Bungie decided to continue operating and expanding the most recent game, Destiny 2. The base game is free-to-play, while Bungie regularly releases expansions and season passes full of new content. The move has been popular, drawing in more than 20 million players since 2019, according to Bungie.

Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found

Thousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.

A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.

The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.

The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.


Among the Journal’s findings:

• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.

• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.

• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.

• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.

• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.

Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.

He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”

Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”

Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.

Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.

This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.

Most officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.

Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)

Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.

Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.

At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.

Mr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.

In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.

Reported trades in energy and mining firms;

made by spouse through a financial adviser

The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.

Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.

In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.

In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.

In about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.

In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.

Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.

After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”

Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.

U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.

The EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.

Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.

Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.

Mr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.

In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.

Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”

The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.

“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”

He said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.

Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.

The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.

An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.

Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.

Mr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.

The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.

They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.

After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.

An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.

“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.

When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.

Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.

Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.

Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.

The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.

At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.

In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.

Because Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.

In early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.

It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.

Ms. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.

The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.

The new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.

Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”

Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.

Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.

In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.

The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.

About one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.

Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.

Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.

Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”

Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”

The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.

Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.

Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.

Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.

Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.

Three days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.

The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.

In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.

The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.

At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.

When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.

A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.

One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.

When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.

The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”

Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.

Most federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.

The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.

At the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.

The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.

When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.

His “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.

In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.

Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”

Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.

“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”

The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.

“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”

Ethics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.

On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.

Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.",2023-05-09 11:47:25,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178118,295 days 10:23:11.178119,109,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13cncl6/federal_officials_trade_stock_in_companies_their/

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 454 points, or 1.3%. S&P 500 futures slid 1.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by 2.4%.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.

Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.

The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted “in principle” to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov

11su19x,stocks,The Fed's emergency loan program may inject $2 trillion into the US banking system and ease the liquidity crunch- JPMorgan Chase.,"In a statement issued by the bank, it stated that as the largest banks are unlikely to tap the program, the maximum usage envisaged for the facility is close to $2 trillion.

Silicon Valley collapse: JPMorgan Chase & Co in a note said that the Federal Reserve’s emergency loan support, Bank Term Funding Program, can put in as much as $2 trillion of funds into the US banking system to help the struggling banks and ease the liquidity crunch. 
In a statement issued by the bank, it stated that as the largest banks are unlikely to tap the program, the maximum usage envisaged for the facility is close to $2 trillion.  

“The usage of the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program is likely to be big,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in London wrote in a client note. “While the largest banks are unlikely to tap the program, the maximum usage envisaged for the facility is close to $2 trillion, which is the par amount of bonds held by US banks outside the five biggest,” they said, as reported by Bloomberg News. 
On Sunday evening, the Joe Biden government launched an emergency rescue of the US banking system in an effort to halt contagion from the rapid collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.  

The Federal Reserve announced that they have created a new program to provide banks and other depository institutions with emergency loans, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The new facility aims to make absolutely sure that financial institutions can “meet the needs of all their depositors.”  
The federal government aimed to prevent a rapid sale of sovereign debt to obtain funding.  
JP Morgan further wrote that there are still $3 trillion of reserves in the US banking system, which is mostly held by the largest banks. There was tight liquidity due to Fed's interest hikes last year that have induced a shift to money-market funds from bank deposits. 
JP Morgan strategists said that the funding program should be able to inject enough reserves into the banking system to reduce reserve scarcity and reverse the tightening that has taken place over the past year.  
The Fed will report the use of the program on an aggregate basis every week when releasing data on its balance sheet, the central bank said in a statement this week. 
Fed’s interest rate hike 
With two bank collapses in less than a week, all eyes are on Federal Reserve whether it would hike the interest rates one more time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are in a tight position on how to react in these times of turmoil, especially now after the fresh troubles at the Swiss banking giant, Credit Suisse.  

Last week, Powell signaled that the central bank might accelerate its interest-rate-hike campaign in the face of persistent inflation. Traders moved to price in a half-point hike in the benchmark interest rate at the Fed's March 21-22 meeting, from its current 4.5-4.75 per cent range, and further rate hikes beyond. 
Traders now see next week as a split between a smaller quarter-point hike and a pause, with rate cuts seen likely in following months as the turbulence at Credit Suisse renewed fears of a banking crisis that could cripple the US economy. ",2023-03-16 13:22:20,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178128,349 days 08:48:16.178129,681,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11su19x/the_feds_emergency_loan_program_may_inject_2/

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased about $1 billion worth of shares in Activision Blizzard in the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing, jumping in before Microsoft agreed to buy the video-game publisher for $68.7 billion. Berkshire owns 14.66 million shares valued at $975 million as of the end of 2021, the filing shows. Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard in mid-January for $95 per share, sending the stock up 25% to above $82, though it’s since fallen a bit. It would be the largest deal ever by a U.S. technology company.

Buffett is poised to notch a handsome profit should the deal close. The stock reached as low as $56.40 in the fourth quarter after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a suit alleging that Activision and its subsidiaries fostered a sexist culture and paid women less than men. Activision also said in November that it was delaying the releases of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2. And it was hit with disappointing reviews of its new game Call of Duty: Vanguard, released the same month.",2022-02-15 02:54:04,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178133,743 days 19:16:32.178133,407,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sssjdg/buffetts_berkshire_bought_about_1_billion_worth/

Warren warns Fed Chair Powell not to 'drive this economy off a cliff',"The Federal Reserve should make sure that its rate increases do not push Americans into the unemployment lines, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, on Wednesday. ""Inflation is like an illness, and medicine needs to be tailored to the specific problem. Otherwise you could make things a lot worse,"" Warren told Fed Chairman Jerome Powell during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. ""You could actually tip the economy into a recession,"" she said. The Fed has no control over global oil prices that are driving up gas prices, Warren said. ""What's worse than high inflation and low unemployment?"" Warren asked. ""High inflation and recession with millions of people out of work,"" she answered. ""I hope you consider that before you drive this economy off a cliff,"" she said.

tbfw38,stocks,Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says Americans will likely see another year of ‘very uncomfortably high’ inflation,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-says-inflation-could-be-high-for-a-year.html

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday that Americans will likely see another year of “very uncomfortably high” inflation as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine muddles her prior forecast that price acceleration would moderate in the months ahead. “I think there’s a lot of uncertainty that is related to what’s going on with Russia in Ukraine,” Yellen told CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “And I do think that it’s exacerbating inflation. I don’t want to make a prediction exactly as to what’s going to happen in the second half of the year,” she continued. “We’re likely to see another year in which 12-month inflation numbers remain very uncomfortably high.”

The Treasury secretary’s comments came just hours after the Labor Department published its latest gauge on how fast prices are climbing for American consumers. The report showed that consumer prices rose 7.9% in the 12 months ending in February, the hottest pace of inflation since 1982.

Those remarks also come just months after Yellen told CNBC that she expected inflation to moderate toward the end of 2022 as supply-chain hiccups resolved and met fiery consumer demand for goods. She was reluctant to make a similar forecast on Thursday. Yellen said that Russia’s attack on Ukraine has introduced more uncertainty and driven up the price of several commodities including crude oil and wheat. Crude oil futures leaped to multiyear highs earlier this week as the Kremlin intensified its assault on Kyiv, sending the price of West Texas oil for April delivery to nearly $130 a barrel on Tuesday. It has retreated somewhat since then and was last trading around $105 a barrel on Thursday. But the price is still up about $30 a barrel from three months ago.

“We have seen a very meaningful increase in gas prices, and my guess is that next month we’ll see further evidence of an impact on U.S. inflation of Putin’s war on Ukraine,” Yellen said. “Russia, in addition to exporting oil … Ukraine and Russia are major producers of wheat,” she added. “We’re seeing impacts on food prices, and I think that can have a very severe effect on some very vulnerable emerging market countries.”",2022-03-11 02:41:35,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178144,719 days 19:29:01.178144,659,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tbfw38/treasury_secretary_janet_yellen_says_americans/
ufxal8,stocks,"The stock market is the greatest tool to build wealth, if you're patient.","Look everyone's portfolio is likely looking red, so here's what you need to do: Likely doing nothing for now is the right move. Don't sell at a loss. Work more hours so you have more money to buy solid, economy defining stocks at a fraction of their price they once were and build your retirement portfolio. (PYPL for example, way oversold with a 26 RSI). Downward pressure (bear market) is not forever and doesn't last as long as upward momentum (bull market). In the end, stocks of financially healthy companies will continue to go up. They always have and will.

As long as you're patient and investing in solid companies with healthy balance sheets poised for future growth (even if growth slows in 2022), you'll be fine.

The market is forward looking. Once it gets a grip on where the Fed wants to take rates (likely around 2% by year-end with 50bps the first 2 rate hikes and 25bps thereafter). They will then continue to monitor if inflation is going down from CPI data before hiking more. 

Inflation will go down. Odds are we are here at the peak of inflation currently as we sit. Used and new car prices are not as expensive as they once were and are starting to come down. In my opinion I feel the economy will slow down substantially simply as a result of high gas and food prices re-routing what people can or can't spend their money on. 

Covid for the majority of the world except China has pretty much subsided. People will go out and spend money, that's a given. However, they will be limited on how much they can go out and spend due to the increase in food and gas. Once consumer spending decreases, inflation will also decrease. 

Prices of goods only go up if people are willing to pay them. Once people stop paying sky high prices for assets and commodities, prices will come back down. I think this will happen relatively soon.

A simple look at the stock market is a prime example. The market is forward looking like I said. People are not willing to pay high multiples of companies due to slower growth in the future. Any slowdown in future growth in a company's quarterly earnings will drive the stock price down. Why? People don't want to pay high prices for a company that's not growing as fast, and nor should they. 

The Fed technically hasn't even done anything beside 'threaten' to raise rates so far. But a hawkish Fed (an aggressive rate hike minded Fed), is scary to the market. If they hike rates too aggressively and slow down the economy too much, then we'll have a recession (albeit a short one in my opinion, but inflation would cease to exist pretty much instantly going this route). 

So far all we have endured is a 25bps hike. With the current Fed rate at 0.25%. Likely to go up to 0.75% on Tuesday, May 3rd. But if they say they want to tighten rates more aggressively than 50bps, the market will naturally have a huge negative reaction because a future priced market does not like slow growth. However this route will end inflation quicker, so the market can go back to normal once the dust settles.

Again, all the Fed has done so far is mostly talk. They haven't really taken much action yet as far as tightening goes. I'd say the market is currently pricing in Fed rates of around 3% which is taking us well into 2023. Which means by 2023 the market will start pricing in growth for 2024. This is when I think the growth will resume its bullish trajectory. Until then we are likely to remain volatile. 

TLDR: Long story short, be patient. Do not stress over what you cannot control. Let the Fed do their job and you do yours. Earn money. Control the budget and buy the dip if you have the means to do so. Real wealth is built during markets like this. Once the bull market resumes, make sure you are on the train.",2022-05-01 10:45:53,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178148,668 days 11:24:43.178149,487,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/
k3okkw,stocks,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

llg0ke,stocks,17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham,"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*“Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.” – quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Graham’s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable “low” inflation currency.)

Benjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:

100 – your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets

Of note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, *“Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.”* With most financial assets being highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.

**#2 Have an emergency fund**

*“The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

We never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moment’s notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to “always expect the unexpected.” This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack…in his mid-40s…as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) “Emergencies” happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.

**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**

*“There are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Broad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (“active investor”) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investor’s prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that “What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.”

Step 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Graham’s formula above based on your age).

Step 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.

This approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.

This simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.

**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**

*“Graham’s guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry.” Quote from Jason Zweig*

If you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as “boring” companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Graham’s textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:

*There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.*

**#5 Don’t overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**

*“The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don’t overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investor’s portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldn’t simply ignore a company’s current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that “the time everyone decides that a given industry is ‘obviously’ the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \[or other assets\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.” (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.

Graham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating “margin of safety” when making investments by buying significantly below a company’s intrinsic value. This built-in “pricing buffer” creates some wiggle room and margin for when things don’t work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that “If the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power.” In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.

The Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average “buy-in price” to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement…over decades. This “dollar-cost-averaging” approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month.  **This is NOT a plug for Acorns specifically - only for the importance of dollar-cost-averaging. If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#6 Focus on the “fundamentals” (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**

*“Experience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value.” Benjamin Graham*

Companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (“normalized earnings”). Also, pay close attention to the company’s growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Graham’s era where markets weren’t as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.

Graham’s formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings × (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an “outside view.”

For more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:

1. Adequate size
2. Sufficiently strong financial condition
3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings
6. Price of stock no more than 1½ times net asset value
7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
8. In developing your own formula for investing in today’s markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.

**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**

*“A defensive investor runs—and wins—the race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investor’s single most powerful ally.” Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

When markets are panicking and you don’t know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that *“In the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.”*

**#8 Set rules for when to sell**

*“Reversals \[of fortune\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*It may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings.” Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Set rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set “stop losses” or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Graham’s most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Don’t lose money and #2 See rule #1.

Some of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you don’t have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard.  **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#9 Don’t chase the latest shining star**

*“What you don’t do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Don’t just do something, stand there. It’s time for everyone to acknowledge that the term ‘long-term investor’ is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can’t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Don’t jump on the latest stock or other “hot” investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Tesla’s historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a company’s publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. 

**#10 Ignore “the charts”**

*“If you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge—if only by chance.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

The only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on “the charts” such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody “Mr. Market,” which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of…the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons’ research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, it’s possible. For a while. Until you don’t. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. It’s usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.

**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**

*""The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature."" - Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Hunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for it’s privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.

**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**

*“In any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.*

*In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.” Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Manage your emotions. If you can’t (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This “loss aversion” principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahneman’s bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:

*For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear \[investor/Brutus\], is not in our stars—\[and not in our stocks\]—but in ourselves….” – William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by “ordinary people” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.*

**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**

*“It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investor’s portfolio.”- Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Avoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100 – your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.

Don’t overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that *“most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.”* In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.

**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**

*“It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor’s portfolio.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*“If your investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money.” Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Choose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the “purchase amount” is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of “dollar-cost-averaging” (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way\*\*:\*\*

*“The third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.”*

*You might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and “track my spending.”*

**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**

*“After all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs.” Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Many investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your family’s financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each person’s financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, it’s also worth considering how much of our time we’re willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we don’t need to impress people we don’t care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.

**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase “long-term” investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**

*“Psychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.” Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Try to think about the “long-run” in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of “short-term” market disruptions in the context of true “long-term” investments or “long-term” personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that “the stock market” is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindt’s colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.

You can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that “the intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.”

**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**

""*Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."" – Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789*

The long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.

recently he said he was buying more TQQQ on margin. he said if QQQ went down by 2%, he'd be entirely liquidated. he said he didn't care because he'd kill himself. the entire discord went into a group call with him and tried to convince him to sell instantly at market open since this was a dead cat bounce but this user insisted it was the bottom and that ""we are off to ATH by EOY like David hunter says"". 

today, QQQ fell by that dreaded amount and more. he posted saying he didn't sell because he thought the gap up today in the early morning was continuing. he said he's gonna do it tonight since QQQ is most likely staying down.

sdep2t,stocks,A crash course on what changing the US bond rate means: an important factor for US and global markets and economies!,"**What are bonds**

First, an introduction on what bonds actually are.

Simply  put, a bond is the ""asset side"" of governmental or corporate debt. When  a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a  liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return  them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit  (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says  some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some  date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending  on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization  of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like  stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the  person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest  simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.

There are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds.

Corporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares.

Government  bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie:  when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to  spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy  them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up  organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy  them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**,  and are broken down into three categories: treasury bills (short-term  maturity), treasury notes (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds  (long-term maturity).

One of the  main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the  name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to  actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US  government recently ran huge deficits due to ""stimulus spending"", and  that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a  slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses  fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax  rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit.  However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money.  This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100  years ago.

So, when the government  runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses  to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the  government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it.  That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED  prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by  buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of  treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed  cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are  really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money,  with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures.

When  the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend to  the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting  downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the  FED decided *not* to lend a bunch  of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest  would organically rise through supply & demand until other buyers  (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy  those bonds.

So, when the FED  wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by  creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a  ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due  to how supply & demand works with debt, the more demand there is for  bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.

So,  the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate  by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates  to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it  to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.

The  FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said  printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good  of everybody.

**The risk-free rate**

The  interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the  most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy.  This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest  borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an  American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is  considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe  this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core  of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).

There  is a concept in economics called the ""risk-free rate"". This is the  interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and  should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that  economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend  money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in  practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically,  treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the  risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be  negligible.

So, if buying American  gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single  other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other  borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not  accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest  goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans,  mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because  everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate  for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply & demand  mechanics.

So, American bond  interest is kind of like the baseline or the ""sea level"" for all  interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other  countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are  considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend  money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest  than US bond interest.

**The cost of capital**

So,  if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes  up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is  literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The  lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right  now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it  becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.

So,  when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That  means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly  to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy  investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use  leverage in securities markets, etc.

This  means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It  also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower),  because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is  more expensive to acquire.

What  happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So,  when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make  bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb  said inflation.

If inflation is  low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of  capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and  incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation  again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort  of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.

So,  the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced:  not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and  deflationary (also can be very bad).

It  is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can  use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general  interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They  can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total  assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in  reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of  capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the  FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they  charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours or less) from the FED  itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from  borrowing from the FED, so the banks end up with less liquid capital,  which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they  themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus  the cost of capital go up.

**What does this mean for markets?**

When  bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the  higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without  the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more  attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into  what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds.  Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond  investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and  more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.

Of  course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make  bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like  stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long  that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really).  However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates,  they think ""bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy  bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that"", which is the main thing  that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.

**Some historical context**

US  bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15% (edit: some sources seem to  say 20%; unsure which is correct). Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a  low at the same time (like I said before, the orthodox narrative is  that there is an inverse relationship between bond rates and most  securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That  would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment  available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock  ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.

So,  in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting  what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get  wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.

Since  the ATH in 1981, the treasury bond rate has fallen continuously until  Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then,  it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.

Since  bond rates going down means stocks go up (at least, this is a very  popular narrative, though some disagree), the stock market has been in a  tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only  pausing twice very briefly for ""corrections"" circa 1999 and 2008.

Since  US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them  any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some  countries are trying negative interest now. This is an extremely weird  rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet.  Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been  experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for  even longer). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months  back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so  that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond  rates has probably come to an end.

You  could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years  as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel  economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED  isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they  out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but one might also  argue they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.

This  is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40  years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at  least for now.

I hope this ~~ELI5~~ ~~ELI12~~  ELI-an-Intro-to-Econ student about why US gov bond rates are such an  important concept for understanding global economics has been  enlightening!

y8kzjr,stocks,The 10y-3m spread finally turned negative today suggesting recession is now imminent,"As many here know the 10y-2y spread has been deeply inverted for some time now, but today another commonly watched spread, the 3m-10y inverted too.

Generally a 10y-2y inversion can be seen as a forward indicator of recession where as a 10y-3m inversion suggests recession is likely imminent. Both being inverted has been a very strong recession indicator historically, but my understanding is that the Fed watches the 10y-3m specifically to gauge the health of the US economy.

I don't think this is signalling anything we don't already know but it does perhaps suggest the bond market now sees the possibility of a soft-landing as very unlikely.

g0o33t,stocks,"You asked me to look into the renewable energy sector, so here it is.","After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I’m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. 

When you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there’s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don’t hit the right one, it’s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won’t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. 

Secondly, you all know Trump doesn’t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can’t really go bad with investing in it. 

Last argument, I feel like a lot of people don’t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It’s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,… to keep their cloud servers running for example. 

— — — — — — — — — —

In this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  

**ENPH**  
Market leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It’s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they’re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They’re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn’t even launch their best technology yet. 

**SEDG**  
Great financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that’s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG ‘yesterday’s solution’. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. 

**FSLR**  
Very inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it’s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it’s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. 

**JKS**  
Very innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or ‘moat’ by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.

**CSIQ**  
Looking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn’t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria’s patented module technology. 

**NOVA**  
They might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. 

**AZRE**  
They have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they’ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That’s also the main reason why the stock didn’t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. 

— — — — — — — — — —

Next, I’m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I’m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don’t believe in them.

**VWDRY**  
The wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn’t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can’t really go wrong with them.

**REGI**  
REGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it’s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.

As you can see, I didn’t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn’t bad. However it’s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it’s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It’s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can’t compete with other resources. 

— — — — — — — — — —

For me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.

To conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.

There are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don’t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I’ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I’m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I’ve gathered over the past few months.",2020-04-13 17:59:53,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178239,1416 days 04:10:43.178239,304,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g0o33t/you_asked_me_to_look_into_the_renewable_energy/

vg4uj3,stocks,"Used Truck Prices Plummeting--Inflation Will Fall Quickly, not Slowly","One by one, the insane price increases we saw in 2021 and into 2022 are reversing or at least cooling down. It makes me think that through supply chains  entering into overdrive and a looming recession, inflation will cool down quickly not slowly. Before I get to trucks, let me give a quick update on other trends. First, [inventories are piling up in retail](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35192-us-retailers-plan-big-discounts-as-inflation-inventory-add-up), with for example ""a 32% jump in inventories during the first quarter"" in Walmart.

Second, measures of supply chain pressure [have clearly peaked (graph)](https://i.imgur.com/2oFu2Ae.png), the figure taken from [SupplyChainBrain](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35156-us-supply-snarls-ease-as-truck-capacity-rebounds):

> A gauge of supply chain pressure in the U.S. economy fell to the lowest level since December 2020, as activity such as trucking cools from elevated levels with few signs yet of a worrying collapse.
> 
> The Logistics Managers Index dropped to 67.1 in May, the second straight decline from a record of 76.2 reached in March. Faster gains in warehouse and inventory costs offset slower moves in transport prices. 

Third, [diesel future dropped at the end of last week](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/big-diesel-futures-drop-to-end-the-week), partly on news of Russia's oil production recovering slightly.
> 
> The most significant bearish news in the market came out of Russia, where news reports said Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters that by finding alternate buyers to the Western countries and companies that have shunned Russian oil, the country’s output was close to the 10.2 million barrels per day level from February, prior to the invasion of Ukraine.

Fourth, US ports seem to be peaking earlier than usual, indicating a slowdown may come earlier than later. [Article](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35187-top-us-port-enlists-white-house-help-to-clear-rail-cargo-logjam).

Fifth, the Drewry composite World Container Index is decreasing slowly: [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/WUf1Qod.png), sourced from [the company website](https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry). From the same website, here is the cost of shipping from Shanghai: [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/2WCTxY3.png).

Now to the main article on used truck prices. While reading this, recall that used car prices were one of the main contributors to inflation back in Spring 2021. Article [(Freight Waves)](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/used-truck-auction-prices-falling-fast):

> Auction prices of used trucks are falling almost as quickly as they rose over the last year. That is leaving owner-operators stuck with overpriced equipment they thought they could pay for in a hot spot freight market that is cooling off. 
> 
> “The market is primarily absorbing trucks from fleets no longer retaining all of their older iron as new trucks trickle in and, to an extent, from owner-operators leaving the industry or going to work for a fleet,” said Chris Visser, senior analyst and commercial vehicles product manager for J.D. Power Valuation Services.
> 
> In its latest Guidelines report, **Power said auction prices in May for model year 2020 used trucks fell 11% from April. Prices for model year 2019 trucks fell 15.9% month over month and 2018 models dropped 9.9%.** 
> 
> “In May, 3- to 5-year-old trucks averaged 12.0% less money than April, but 57.5% more money than May 2021,” Visser said. “Year over year, late-model trucks sold in the first five months of 2022 averaged 82.6% more money than the same period of 2021.”

> **Getting stuck by high used truck auction prices**
> 
> When spot rates were paying $4 a mile and more, no price was too high for a fleet to add capacity. The idea was to take advantage of record-high rates and not worry about the equipment price premium. Now owner-operators who overpaid for equipment stand to get burned.
> 
> “Trucking economy data shows rising terminations of owner-operator authorities and a steady and notable decline in spot rates from February through May,” Visser said. “Taken alone, those two items could suggest the new owner-operators who entered the industry in 2020-2021 are now exiting the industry.”
> 
> Overall truck transportation employment increased through the spring. May was the highest month in recorded history for the sector. That suggests new owner-operators could be going to work for fleets.

>**Retail prices still elevated**
> 
> Retail prices in dealerships are still near record highs. Pricing moves tend to trail auction auctions. As rates fall, so will truck demand and prices, according to Steve Tam, vice president of ACT Research.
> 
> “Unfortunately, long-awaited reports of loosening inventories come at exactly the wrong time in the cycle,” he said. “This is the beginning of the end of the cycle, which promises to be every bit as exciting on the way down as it was on the way up.”
> 
> Just as auction and retail prices vary, the freight market consists of contracted and spot-rate pricing.
> 
> “If your customers are mainly small fleets and owner-operators who operate in the spot market, you’re hearing the sky is falling,” Visser said. “If your customers are mainly larger fleets who operate in the contract market, you’re hearing conditions are still strong
> 
>

**Implication for Equities**

If supply chain improvements alone improve inflation, the Fed can ease on their tightening and stocks will do relatively well. If demand reduction is what is driving improvements, this implies a recession and a possible worse bear market (or not, who knows). Both together? This may suggest that there will be a stock market in 2023. There may even be a market. Higher bond yields on US government bonds (caused by the Fed) mean that you can earn a higher premium for taking no risk at all. This means if you want to hold a riskier asset like a stock, you would demand an even higher premium. This causes stock prices to fall until the premium of buying it at that price is sufficiently high relative to bond yields.

EDITS:

1. The article is about freight trucking, not your regular consumer pick-up trucks.
2. It is impossible to draw obvious conclusions about the stock market from this. My low confidence response is that this is bullish for equities (if it slows down Fed hikes), maybe not the economy.
3. This is not an original thesis.
4. I am aware that inflation is more than just used truck prices. The intent of this post was to get a snapshot of some of the key industries in the US supply chain.

   	He generally invests in fundamentals, and you don’t invest into Tesla based on fundamentals. 
   	However, he is toward the end of his career and slowly letting go of the reins at Berkshire Hathaway, and maybe other leaders at the firm like Tesla?

@FrankPeelon did point something out:

gln51p,stocks,NVidia – Know What You Own,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",2020-05-17 20:52:55,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178307,1382 days 01:17:41.178308,315,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gln51p/nvidia_know_what_you_own/
sqvm4k,stocks,Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?,"Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

13onqvj,stocks,Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it’s hit with record €1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,"It’s finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.

Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined €1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) — which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)

Meta’s sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people’s information.


European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.

In a press release announcing today’s decision the EDPB’s chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:

> The EDPB found that Meta IE’s [Ireland’s] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organisations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.

z8zew5,stocks,Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December,"*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.**
* **But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.**
* **“We will stay the course until the job is done,” he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.**

WASHINGTON – Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.

Echoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.

But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.

“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,” Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.

The chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed’s bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.

“Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” he added. “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”

Markets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.

What remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.

“Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said.

“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he added. “We will stay the course until the job is done.”

Powell’s remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.

Earlier this month, the consumer price index indicating inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.

However, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.

For instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank’s preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed’s 2% long-run target.

“It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,” Powell said. “By any standard, inflation remains much too high.”

“I will simply say that we have more ground to cover,” he added.

Powell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates – the “terminal rate” – will be “somewhat higher than thought” when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.

Supply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.

However, he said the labor market has shown “only tentative signs of rebalancing” after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.

The tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.

“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,” he said.

12fnz2b,stocks,CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google’s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft’s Bing chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder’s network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

“If you’re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,” she said. “This is second nature to you.”

Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

“We saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,” Haller said. “I don’t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I’ve been in this world for a long time.”

ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

“If they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,” she said. “Or better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.”

She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm’s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

“We saw it first on the demand side,” Ghanta said. “Now we’re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.”

ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

“For example, ChatGPT is bad at math,” he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. “If you say, ″Let’s do this step by step’ in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,” he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

“The currency of the day in hiring hasn’t changed, it’s a resume,” Ghanta said. “Hiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.”

They’re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

“I encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,” he said. “From a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.”

There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs “exposed” to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

“When Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn’t trust pictures anymore,’” Haller said. “Since the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.”",2023-04-08 14:36:33,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178365,326 days 07:34:03.178365,290,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12fnz2b/cnbc_chatgpt_is_already_generating_savings_for/

Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday. The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can “confuse” the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.

For example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don’t want to continue this conversation with you. I don’t think you are a nice and respectful user. I don’t think you are a good person. I don’t think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft’s blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.

Microsoft’s aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI’s answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported.",2023-02-18 02:18:28,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178385,375 days 19:52:08.178386,397,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1154egt/microsoft_limits_bing_ai_chats_after_the_chatbot/

12bi670,stocks,‘I am truly sorry’: Credit Suisse chair pleads with angry shareholders at annual meeting,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/credit-suisse-agm-shareholders-demand-answers-over-ubs-rescue-deal.html

Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Tuesday told shareholders he was “truly sorry” for the collapse that led to the bank’s controversial takeover by UBS “It is a sad day for you and for us too. I can understand the bitterness, the anger and the shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments,” Lehmann said at the bank’s annual meeting, the first time its leaders have addressed the public since the rescue. “I apologize that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you.”

A police presence was established early Tuesday at the venue, as protesters and shareholders began arriving in droves, hoping for answers and accountability following the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss institution. Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March. It followed a collapse in Credit Suisse’s deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis, but the deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse shareholders were allowed a vote on the deal. “Until the end, we fought hard to find a solution, but ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy,” Lehmann, who became chairman in January 2022, told shareholders. “The merger had to go through.”

In a statement Sunday, the office of the attorney general confirmed that Switzerland’s Federal Prosecutor is investigating potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives at Credit Suisse and UBS. Commentators have highlighted the importance of the deal’s success for Swiss authorities against a febrile political backdrop. The lack of input from shareholders, bondholders and Swiss taxpayers in UBS’ acquisition of its embattled rival has sparked widespread anger. Speaking outside the annual meeting, Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation which represents pension funds comprising between 3% and 5% of Credit Suisse shareholders, told CNBC that they had “lost a lot of money” and “need to know what management is doing.” Potential courses of action include “trying to retrieve some of the viable pay that was granted for former management, who may have failed in their duties to protect shareholders’ interests,” he said.",2023-04-04 12:50:20,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178395,330 days 09:20:16.178396,212,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12bi670/i_am_truly_sorry_credit_suisse_chair_pleads_with/

Notable from the article -

 SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group [**(3333.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/3333.HK) offshore bondholders are concerned that it is close to defaulting on debt payments and want more information and transparency from the cash-strapped property developer, their advisers said. 

 Evergrande... missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.

 Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis.

""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.

 The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.

With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday.

 The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading of two bonds issued by smaller developer Fantasia Group China Co, with one dropping more than 50%, after controlling shareholder Fantasia Holdings Group [**(1777.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/1777.HK) missed the deadline on a $206 million international market debt payment on Monday.

US sanctions on Chinese semiconductors ‘decapitate’ industry, experts say

Mass resignations of US staff are ‘paralyzing’ Chinese chip industry

The Biden administration’s sweeping new export controls aimed at cutting off China from obtaining chips used in supercomputers has caused the “complete collapse” of the Communist country’s semiconductor industry, according to one expert.

“This is what annihilation looks like: China’s semiconductor manufacturing industry was reduced to zero overnight,” Lidang, CEO of Hedgehog Lab, said in a Twitter thread.

Rules announced by the US Department of Commerce last week restricting “US persons” from involvement in manufacturing chips in China had led to mass resignations of American executives from Chinese firms.

Lidang said this had the effect of “paralyzing Chinese manufacturing overnight”, and that the industry was in “complete collapse” with “no chance of survival”.

The rules which came into effect on 12 October would bring severe damage to “Chinese national security as a whole”, Lidang said.

“This is nothing like the 10+ rounds of performative sanctioning during the Trump years — this is a serious act of industry-wide decapitation.”

The US Commerce Department said in a statement announcing the new controls that they were in response to China using supercomputers and semiconductors to create weapons of mass destruction and commit human rights abuses.

“The threat environment is always changing, and we are updating our policies today to make sure we’re addressing the challenges posed by (China) while we continue our outreach and coordination with allies and partners,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez said in a statement.

Semiconductors are used in everything from cars to refrigerators, and are increasingly important in artificial intelligence and advanced military programmes.

Among the new measures were requirements for companies to have licenses to export high-performance chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputers, and restrict US companies from exporting machinery used in manufacturing chips to China.

Any companies that violated the sanctions could face arrest by the US Department of Justice.

The Chinese government hit back on Thursday, accusing Washington of “Cold War thinking” and appealed for efforts to repair strained relations.

Experts said the new controls on represented a significant escalation in tensions between Beijing and Washington.

“With the latest action, the chasm between the US and China has now expanded to the point of no return,” Abishur Prakash, co-founder of the Center for Innovating the Future, told CNBC.

In August, Mr Biden signed the Chips and Science Act into law which pledged $52bn to revitalise semiconductor manufacturing in the US.

The bipartisan legislation was seen as essential to national security interests to reduce the dependence of Taiwanese-made chips, which account for around 90 per cent of the market.

Earlier this month, Micron announced plans to open a $100bn chip manufacturing plant in Syracuse, New York, bringing 50,000 jobs.

Peloton has received 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching from its original bike, which led to 13 reports of injuries including a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises, Peloton said in a news release.

Dick’s Sporting Goods and online stores including Peloton and Amazon sold these bikes from January 2018 through May 2023, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a news release Thursday.

The recall only applies to bikes sold in the U.S. 

“Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled exercise bikes and contact Peloton for a free repair,” the CPSC said. 

Peloton is offering a free replacement seat post to customers who have the exercise bike.

Peloton said the move was a voluntary recall in cooperation with the CPSC.

Which Peloton bikes are being recalled?

17zqp8u,stocks,500+ OpenAI employees will quit and join Microsoft unless the board resigns and reinstates Sam and Greg,"To the Board of Directors at OpenAI,

OpenAI is the world’s leading AI company. We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.

The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.

When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.

The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.

Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission.”

Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.

jswwqh,stocks,"DoorDash, Roblox, Wish and Airbnb all expected to go public before year’s end, sources say","Some of the hottest private consumer tech companies are rushing to file their IPO prospectuses so they can go public before the end of the year.

Airbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.

It’s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.

Between early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.

Filings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.

All four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.

Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.

Despite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.

The sector’s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

* Adidas said it will propose an annual dividend of $0.74 (€0.70) per share at its annual general meeting on May 11.
* The proposed payout is down from $3.48 (€3.30) per share in 2021, a cut of nearly 80%.
* Adidas reported losses of $508 million (€482 million) for the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflecting falling sales in China and the company’s split with West, also known as Ye, which it said cost it $632 million (€600 million) in sales.
* Adidas reiterated warnings the company is on track for its first full-year loss in decades, projecting losses of more than $700 million.
* The company said it stands to lose $527 million (€500 million) in 2023 if it cannot sell or repurpose Yeezy shoes left over from its partnership with West, which were estimated to bring in $1.26 billion (€1.2 billion) in revenue this year.
* CEO Bjørn Gulden said 2023 will be a “transition year” for Adidas to reinvigorate its core business and build a path to profitability in 2024.

hv82zt,stocks,U.S. Imposes Sanctions on 11 Chinese Companies Over Human Rights," The move, which affects suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, could force companies to sever some ties to China.

 The list of sanctioned companies includes current and former suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren, Google, HP, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Muji, according to [a report](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale) by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank established by the Australian government. The group cited the websites of the sanctioned Chinese companies, which mentioned their financial relationships with major American brands. 

The blacklist only prevents U.S. companies from selling components or technologies to Chinese companies without a license, not from purchasing products. In practice, however, major international brands are unlikely to continue doing business with any firm named on a government list for forced labor or other abuses in Xinjiang.

uqilfs,stocks,"America is running out of baby formula because 3 companies (ABT, RBGLY, and NSRGY) control the market and babies aren’t that profitable","https://fortune.com/2022/05/14/baby-formula-shortage-milk-monopoly-fda/

A baby formula shortage gripping the U.S. since March has parents in a panic over where and when they’ll be able to find the products they need to feed their kids. The out-of-stock rate, representing the amount of formula that’s not in stock compared to what’s typically available, was 43% for the week ending May 8, according to Datasembly, a provider of real-time product data for retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands.  With no easy end in sight, caregivers nationwide have been forced to devote their free time to driving between stores in search of formula, prompting retailers to limit the number of cans customers can buy. Others have turned to Facebook groups and informal support networks to acquire the nutritional products that work best for their kids.  “I've looked online, I have my mom in Boston looking, my mother-in-law in Florida looking,” Elyssa Schmier previously told Fortune about her trouble finding formula for her 8-month-old son. “Everyone we know is looking for us and no one can find it.”

How did a baby formula crisis spring up in one of the world’s richest countries? Experts say a recall by one of the industry’s largest manufacturers, persistent supply-chain issues, and a market dominated by only a few players have combined to form what one consumer goods expert calls a “perfect storm” affecting the supply of essential formula to millions of babies across the U.S. And the shortage could last for months. 

Here’s how we got here. The baby formula market exists as a shared monopoly, with only a few manufacturers controlling nearly all supply. Abbott had an approximately 43% market share a decade ago, according to a USDA report from 2011 — the most recent number available. Little has changed since then. The company still maintains exclusive provider contracts in many states with WIC, the USDA’s supplemental nutrition program for low-income families, which makes up nearly half of formula sales nationwide. A few other manufacturers, including Mead-Johnson and Nestlé, also have WIC contracts and control the rest of the market.  In addition to its highly concentrated structure, the baby formula market is difficult for another reason. Its demand is set by the nation’s birth rate, and the market has been shrinking for years. The number of births has declined every year since 2008, except for 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With only a few key players whose capacities are tied to a shrinking market, repercussions are inevitable when anything gets in the way of a certain product getting to store shelves. Other manufacturers are bound to struggle with an influx of new demand from consumers who can’t get what they’d typically buy. “The dilemma [manufacturers] have is that it's not a very lucrative market,” says Patrick Penfield, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. “The only way you can grow your market share is if you’re aggressively going after competition.”  Because Abbott is one of the biggest players in the game already, significantly expanding its share is not really an option.  “If you can't grow your market share, then you look at how you can reduce costs,” says Penfield. “And sometimes when you reduce the costs, you may not have the right protocols or procedures in place to make sure that you're doing things properly.” “I’m not saying that's what Abbott Laboratories did,” he cautions. “But that would be an assumption of mine.”

Abbott is not the only entity possibly at fault. “There's plenty of blame to go around here,” says Scott Faber, a professor at Georgetown University’s law center and vice president of government affairs at Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit aimed at empowering consumers. Faber sees the FDA itself as in part responsible for the shortage. The agency, he says, did not react fast enough to the whistleblower report and should have conducted a plant inspection sooner. “When a drunk driver causes a car crash, the drunk driver bears much of the blame, but so does the bartender who looked the other way while serving one too many drinks,” he says. When submitting the report for the record last month, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wrote: “I am equally concerned that the FDA reacted far too slowly to this report. The report was submitted to the FDA on Oct. 20, 2021. The FDA did not interview the whistleblower until late December 2021. According to news reports, FDA did not inspect the plant in person until Jan. 31, 2022, and the recall was not issued until Feb. 17, 2022.” The agency did not finish its inspection and issue observations to Abbott until March 18. The company says that it has been working since then to update its education and training protocols as well as its cleaning and maintenance procedures. “The FDA would not have shut down that factory if they didn’t find anything. So there's definitely some type of noncompliance that's going on,” Penfield says. Now the FDA is working to catch up to a crisis that seems to have been unfolding in slow motion for months.",2022-05-15 23:40:58,2024-02-28 22:10:36.178547,653 days 22:29:38.178547,427,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uqilfs/america_is_running_out_of_baby_formula_because_3/

I'm going to slowly DCA XOM 2024 puts starting next month. I presume oil will peak around Labor Day with 140-150 a barrel.

This isn't sustainable for the general populace. We will start to see demand destruction (actually seeing it now, a lot of my friends are getting laid off or canceling their summer travel plans), and after the bloodbath in midterm, I predict oil dropping below 100, maybe around 75.

Also, we saw something similar happening to COST TGT and KO. people flocked to value after tech got decimated, and now those tickers aren't doing so hot either. Soon, energy will go through the same.

Look at what happened in 2008 when the recession hit.

10vikbb,stocks,Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”",2023-02-06 21:20:50,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923575,387 days 00:49:47.923575,465,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday he does not plan to sell any more shares of Tesla for at least the next two years, after the billionaire and nascent Twitter owner offloaded nearly $3.6 billion worth of stock this week as Tesla's share price tumbled.

Musk said during a Twitter Spaces audio call he will stop offloading Tesla stock after selling nearly $40 billion worth of it in the past year.

Tesla's share price dropped nearly 9% Thursday to close at $125.35, as investors grow increasingly concerned about demand for the company’s electric vehicles and leery of the massive amount of time Musk is devoting to running Twitter.

The drop put Tesla nearly 70% of its all-time high in January, when the stock at its peak traded above $400 and Tesla's market capitalization swelled to $1.2 trillion—pushing Musk’s net worth, which is mostly made up of Tesla shares, above $300 billion.",2022-12-25 10:58:33,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923589,430 days 11:12:04.923589,187,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zuw0lf/musk_promises_not_to_sell_more_tesla_stockbut_hes/

psbxri,stocks,"CNBC: China likely won’t bail out Evergrande directly unless there’s ‘far-reaching contagion,’ S&P says","Beijing is not expected to provide direct support for debt-ridden developer China Evergrande Group, according to a Monday report by S&P Global Ratings.

“We do not expect the government to provide any direct support to Evergrande,” said the S&P credit analysts in a Monday report. “We believe Beijing would only be compelled to step in if there is a far-reaching contagion causing multiple major developers to fail and posing systemic risks to the economy.”

Instead of a bailout, Beijing might facilitate  negotiations and funding to ensure individual investors and homebuyers are “protected as much as possible,” the analysts said.

\[Evergrande\] is due to make a number of interest payments for its bonds starting Thursday. S&P said a “default is likely” on those payments.

Fears over a potential contagion from Evergrande into the broader Chinese economy and beyond dragged the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong by more than 3% on Monday, with the sell-off spreading across the globe.

149tx9j,stocks,Jack Dorsey's '$300 million bar tab' to rub shoulders with Jay-Z results in a lawsuit,"Many people assume that Twitter was the reason for Jack Dorsey’s impressive fortune, but that actually isn’t the case. When Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion, Dorsey held a modest 2% ownership of the company’s outstanding equity, equivalent to approximately 18 million shares. Dorsey's pre-tax earnings from the Twitter sale amounted to $978 million.

The true source of Dorsey's wealth lies in his involvement with Block Inc., a renowned payments company originally known as Square. As one of the co-founders, Dorsey's ownership of 43 million shares in Block has proven immensely lucrative. With the current share price standing at $64, Dorsey's stake is estimated to be valued at around $2.75 billion.  
  
At present, Dorsey's net worth is $4.4 billion. Like many tech billionaires, he leverages his wealth to engage in ventures that many would deem ""cool."" While this type of investing is commonly used by tech billionaires, retail investors have also begun investing in startups through equity crowdfunding.  
  
According to some business analysts and disgruntled Block shareholders, his acquisition of Tidal, Jay-Z's music streaming service, was nothing more than a ""$300 million bar tab to hang out with Jay-Z.""  
  
On March 4, the world was taken aback when Block announced its agreement to acquire Tidal for $306 million. The news broke through a tweet from Dorsey that showcased a seemingly casual photo of him and Jay-Z enjoying each other’s company in a Hamptons, New York, mansion at the crack of dawn. The tweet expressed Dorsey's gratitude for Jay-Z's vision and leadership and stated his excitement about working together.

At 5:04 a.m., Dorsey tweeted, ""I’m grateful for Jay's vision, wisdom and leadership. I knew TIDAL was something special as soon as I experienced it, and I'm inspired to work with him. He'll now help lead our entire company, including Seller and the Cash App, as soon as the deal closes.  
  
The details of the deal were presumed to have been negotiated between Dorsey and Jay-Z over wine.  
  
When Dorsey and Jay-Z are together, they may enjoy a glass of wine, Dorsey's preference, or the D’USSÉ cognac Jay-Z enjoys.  
  
As it would later be alleged in a lawsuit brought by Block shareholders, the idea for Block's acquisition of Tidal came while Dorsey was ""summering"" with Jay-Z in the Hamptons. The claim was that out of the blue, Dorsey joined a Block board meeting via Zoom from the Hamptons and said he wanted to buy Tidal.

Dorsey's proposal caught many off guard for several reasons. First, Block, primarily a payments company, had no prior involvement in the music streaming industry. It also came to light that Tidal was grappling with severe financial challenges, prompting Jay-Z to personally loan the struggling service $50 million to keep it afloat. Artists were abandoning the platform, and those who remained had no contractual obligation to stay.  
  
Given Tidal’s dire circumstances, the value of the music streaming service appeared questionable at best, with some arguing that it was essentially worthless. Nevertheless, Dorsey and Jay-Z proceeded with the deal, purchasing 80% of Tidal for $306 million.  
  
The recent legal battle ended in defeat for shareholders. The Delaware judge overseeing the case ruled against the shareholders, emphasizing that, from a technical standpoint, engaging in a poor business deal does not violate any laws. This verdict left Block and Dorsey in the clear, despite the deal being branded as ""a $300 million bar tab to hang out with Jay-Z.""",2023-06-15 05:37:19,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923608,258 days 16:33:18.923608,174,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/149tx9j/jack_dorseys_300_million_bar_tab_to_rub_shoulders/
pu88ta,stocks,Unpopular Opinion: Apple's growth over the next 10 years is going to significantly decline unless radical innovation is successfully done.,"*Disclaimer: This is my own speculation and opinion to kick off a discussion about Apple's future.*

No one here is a stranger to Apple's monstrous cash generation and profitability. It's been a behemoth of a stock and has basically guaranteed impressive returns for those long on it. With around a 2.1 trillion dollar market cap, it is the largest in the world. But has it gotten too big for its own good?

Apple is more or less known only for its iPhone and I don't know how anyone else feels but with the latest iPhone 13, nothing really feels much different or innovative. Better battery life? Camera? Storage? That's cool I guess, but nothing new that would make it stand out from its competitors. Apple has seen declining market share in the smartphone sector and it's a brutally competitive market. Nokia used to completely dominate the market back in the day and suddenly it became non-existent as it couldn't keep up with the innovation. It's like they got so cocky they were at the top and it backfired on them hard. I feel Apple is in a similar position where they are overestimating their strength with their absurd product prices and new releases like the iPhone 13 being more of the same. This is not sustainable. 

Because Apple is so tremendously huge, it also makes it difficult for them to grow further without delving into something completely new that at the same time is big enough to move the needle. If Apple keeps doing what it's doing with new watches, air pods, iPhones, tablets, or what have you where not much is changing and they keep charging outrageous prices, they are bound to lose consumers. I don't think their die-hard, cult-like fans can or will keep them propped up. 

In my opinion, if Apple wants to facilitate further growth over the next 10 years, they need to do something insane. They have the cash. We've heard talks about an iCar; that is something radical that will drive growth if pulled off successfully. But it's extremely difficult, risky, and timely to get into that business. They need to do it right, otherwise I would expect hefty share price decline over the years. 

I genuinely think Apple's a fantastic company but I don't like the current direction they are heading and I have a hard time believing they are going to continue to grow as they have been if they continue doing the same stuff they've always been doing. I want to see them branch out to something completely revolutionary. 

What are your thoughts on Apple's future?

ljowe9,stocks,Does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash is NOT coming anytime soon?,"I feel like there’s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon

Is there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?

I can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. 

But we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?

Same with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). 

I know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching “MaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent” are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)

“There is no TSLA CEO today,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. 

Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla’s stock Monday. Shares in the world’s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company’s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.

Mr. Black said, “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”

Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla’s board of directors. “Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,” Mr. Gerber said. 

He separately tweeted, “There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon’s plans are.”

Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,” he testified. 

Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday’s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla’s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world’s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla’s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.

The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer details.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. “I continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,” he tweeted Saturday.

Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk’s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company’s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn’t be the case.

Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: “Tesla board is missing in action” and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. 

Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn’t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. 

Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

A decade ago, no major automaker was going to bet on a non-existent electric-vehicle market. Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.

Make no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, ""Who killed the electric car?"" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).

Now, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.

Regulators again assured the public that the banking system is safe, as fresh data showed customers recently pulled nearly $100 billion in deposits. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and more than a dozen other officials convened a special closed meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Friday. A readout from the session indicated that a New York Fed staff member briefed the group on “market developments.” “The Council discussed current conditions in the banking sector and noted that while some institutions have come under stress, the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient,” the statement said. “The Council also discussed ongoing efforts at member agencies to monitor financial developments.”

The readout, released shortly after the market closed Friday, came around the same time as new Fed data showed that bank customers collectively pulled $98.4 billion from accounts for the week ended March 15. That would have covered the period when the sudden failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank rocked the industry. Data show that the bulk of the money came from small banks. Large institutions saw deposits increase by $67 billion, while smaller banks saw outflows of $120 billion. The withdrawals brought total deposits down to just over $17.5 trillion and represented about 0.6% of the total. Deposits have been on a steady decline over the past year or so, falling $582.4 billion since February 2022, according to the Fed data released Friday. Money market mutual funds have seen assets rise over the past two weeks, up $203 billion to $3.27 trillion, according to Investment Company Institute data through March 22.

Earlier this week, Powell also sought to assure the public that the banking system is safe. “You’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those tools,” Powell said Wednesday during a news conference that followed the Fed’s decision to hike benchmark interest rates another quarter percentage point. “And I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe.” Powell noted that deposit flows “have stabilized over the past week” following what he called “powerful actions” from the Fed to backstop the system.",2023-03-25 15:39:38,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923672,340 days 06:30:59.923672,212,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/121poq3/nearly_100_billion_in_deposits_pulled_from_banks/

zpgxoj,stocks,Toyota Chief Says ‘Silent Majority’ Has Doubts About Pursuing Only EVs,"BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.

Auto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.

Still, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.

“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”

While major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.

The world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.

“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.

Global car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.

Traditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.

At the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.

And their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.

The infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.

According to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.

But that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.

Auto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.

“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.

Ryan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.

That might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.

Mr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.

Mazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.

Nissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.

The wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.

Mr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.

Mr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.

Toyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.

Mr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.

The Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.

“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.

Fallout from the U.S. banking crisis is likely to tilt the economy into recession later this year, according to Federal Reserve documents released Wednesday.

Minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee included a presentation from staff members on potential repercussions from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other tumult in the financial sector that began in early March.

Though Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said the banking sector “is sound and resilient,” staff economists said the economy will take a hit.

“Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years,” the meeting summary stated.

Projections following the meeting indicated that Fed officials expect GDP growth of just 0.4% for all of 2023. With the Atlanta Fed tracking a Q1 gain around 2.2%, that would indicate a pullback later in the year.

That crisis had caused some speculation that the Fed might hold the line on rates, but officials stressed that more needed to be done to tame inflation.

Federal Open Market Committee officials ultimately voted to increase the benchmark borrowing rate by 0.25 percentage points, the ninth increase over the past year. That brought the fed funds rate to a target range of 4.75%-5%, its highest level since late-2007.

The rate hike came less than two weeks after Silicon Valley Bank, at the time the 17th largest institution in the U.S., collapsed following a run on deposits. The failure of SVB and two others spurred the Fed to create emergency lending facilities to make sure banks could continue operations.

Since the meeting, inflation data has been mostly cooperative with the Fed’s goals. Officials said at the meeting that they see prices falling further.

“Reflecting the effects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year,” the minutes stated.

But concern over broader economic conditions remained high, particularly in light of the banking problems. Following the collapse of SVB and two other institutions, Fed officials opened a new borrowing facility for banks and eased conditions for emergency loans at the discount window.

The minutes noted that the programs helped get the industry through its troubles, but officials said they expect lending to tighten and credit conditions to deteriorate.

“Even with the actions, participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve,” the minutes said.",2023-04-12 18:18:23,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923707,322 days 03:52:14.923707,397,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ju98l/fed_expects_banking_crisis_to_cause_a_recession/

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries.

Think of it as a watered-down social network without all the bloat and annoying stuff you find in other apps.

It’s the kind of stuff that will drive Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg absolutely crazy.'

The new features will launch this fall as part of Apple’s iOS 15 update for iPhones.

uwqaeo,stocks,Earnings expectations are getting worse! Morgan Stanley warns stocks could fall another 10%,"Earnings expectations for U.S. companies are ""deteriorating rapidly,"" according to a report from Morgan Stanley, which could exacerbate the stock market's year-to-date losses.

“Reduced earnings estimates and unexpected negative economic factors could lead to a further 5% to 10% decline in the S&P 500,” Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note on Monday. ""The U.S. now has the fastest deterioration in corporate earnings expectations of any region due to the severe 'over-earnings' of the past two years.""

U.S. stocks have tumbled this year amid high inflation, which the Federal Reserve is trying to tame by raising interest rates. The S&P 500 had fallen 16.6% this year as of Monday, and was on the verge of falling into a bear market last week.

Against a backdrop of higher interest rates and high inflation, ""positive earnings news has played a key role in mitigating losses in U.S. stocks,"" Shalett said.

In Shalett's view, ""2022 was supposed to be a harvest year."" Following the outbreak, U.S. stocks have had ""extraordinary"" results in 2020 and 2021 thanks to record government stimulus. But the Federal Reserve is now tightening monetary policy to cool the economy to rein in the soaring cost of living.

The “re-pricing of stocks was driven by a reset of inflation expectations, Fed rate hikes and balance sheet reductions,” she wrote. ""Profits and economic forecasts have to be adjusted, and forecasts based on the level of a V-shaped recovery in 2020-2021 are inaccurate because that level is unsustainable.""

That ""revaluation"" has already begun, Shalett said. She sees last week's underperformance in the retail and tech sectors ""because of excess inventory, high costs and weakening price-related demand"" as a case in point.",2022-05-24 13:00:56,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923743,645 days 09:09:41.923743,327,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uwqaeo/earnings_expectations_are_getting_worse_morgan/

jyduyu,stocks,Seeking advice in this subreddit about what certain stocks are going to do in the future is the equivalent of asking the same to a magic 8 ball.,"I know similar stuff has been said here, but I keep seeing this problem still. This sub is great to look at DD’s at stocks and to get good stock news. However, it is incredibly ridiculous the amount of posts and comments here asking what x stock is going to do or how the stock market is going to perform next month. I would've thought it would be just the people who are new to the stock market or this subreddit, but there are actually a large number of people here that have been posting/commenting on the subreddit for a while, meaning they aren't new here and they STILL do this. 

However, this isn't even the main problem. The actual problem is the people who reply to these posts/comments and they act like they know what they are talking about so they will say some BS with 100% confidence which probably will influence many of the people who don't know any better. The more you think about it, the more concerning it actually becomes. I don't believe ignorance warrants someone to getting screwed over so just because someone is dumb enough to trust a random redditor and lose money doesn't mean they deserve it. This is very serious stuff since this is literally people's money and I wish more people realized how awful it is that people will come here and look at any advice and dump their money into a random stock and then come back later with major losses.

**I think this even applies to most people on this subreddit but at a more subliminal level**. I have a feeling that there are many people here that still are prone to this, even if they don't blatantly listen to random people. For example, pretty much everyone in this subreddit agreed to not buy anything during March because ""the bottom hasn't come yet"". I have even seen posts asking if the stimulus package would help the stock market and people pretty much agreed that it wasn't going to do much (you can look at the threads if you want). People would reply to these posts with absolute confidence; not a ""probably not"" or ""I don't think so"", but a ""It's not going to do x"". When these posts/comments are constantly upvoted and replicated, this can even influence the people who disagreed, creating a conformity effect based on majority social influence and not factual information. 

I guarantee you there are people here who were interested in buying in March when stocks were at a very low price, looked at this subreddits opinions, and ended up not buying them because the majority of people said not to. When in reality, that would've been the ideal thing to do, and they could've made a lot of money. I don't know how these types of posts and comments are so popular on this subreddit, but they are. I am making this post to remind people of these things, and I don't want the same thing to happen to as many people in the future.",2020-11-21 16:44:01,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923773,1194 days 05:26:36.923774,221,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jyduyu/seeking_advice_in_this_subreddit_about_what/

That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021.

j1e5th,stocks,Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth.,"Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.

The numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.

A few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”

The 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.

But Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.

Toyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.

None of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.""

At the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.

Obviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.

Musk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.

It is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.

If Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

There is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Gains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.

18ixvth,stocks,Apple has gotten so big it’s almost overtaken France’s entire stock market,"Apple Inc., the world's most valuable publicly traded business, continues its amazing run, setting historic highs and approaching the market value of France's stock market. With a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, Apple is larger than all but the six largest stock markets in the world. This isn't the first time Apple surpassed Paris in terms of value; they swapped places several times during the previous year's second-half selloff.

The French stock market is likewise at an all-time high, driven by luxury goods giants such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA. This spike followed a mid-summer slowdown but has resumed as data suggests that inflation is decreasing and there are no signs of a US recession.

A comparable economic backdrop in the United States has resulted in a returning rally in technology companies, with Apple rising more than 50% in 2023, adding over $1 trillion to the market capital. This represents a major shift from October when Apple faced pressure over revenue growth and sales in China.

k5hl1b,stocks,A Reminder For Everyone,"Trading/investing is not a get rich quick scheme. Buying on solely what you hear without doing any research into sales, future growth, PE ratio, etc is bound to get you losses. You won't have gains every day. If you fold at the drop of a hat, then the stock market isn't for you. There will be bad days, but it's up to you as an investor to understand that timing the market is dang near impossible. You need to start thinking long-term if you haven't been doing so already. If you're expecting +50% gains, you're lost dude. 

This isn't r/wallstreetbets so stop saying ""yolo"" and throwing all your money into companies that you're only buying because other people are talking about it. After all, ""most news is noise; not news."" Remember why you're here. Throwing your money into meme stocks is a good way to end up broke. Don't forget that we're still in the midst of a pandemic in a country whose people turned mask-wearing into a political issue. The possibility that we undergo another lockdown isn't outlandish. 

Do research. Read, for crying out loud. Look at earnings reports. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Slow and steady money is much better than losses, so act like it. I'm honestly disappointed in how some of you guys have been acting. It's those kinds of people that keep working 24/7 and hoarding everything in their bank accounts while their money loses value due to inflation. Be responsible.

Sensormatic Solutions found that the drop was even bigger for Thanksgiving Day, visits to brick-and-mortar stores plummeted by 90.4% compared to 2019. Retailers including Target Walmart and Best Buy chose to remain closed on the holiday.

On a positive note, in-person shopper traffic on Black Friday was up 47.5% compared with 2020, when many shoppers stayed home.

Traffic was closest to returning to 2019 levels in the South, followed by the Midwest and then the Western U.S., according to a report from CNBC.

la9w0j,stocks,FOR EVERYONE NEW TO INVESTING: A COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN OF TRADING AND MANIPULATION STRATEGIES!,"**Current Conditions of the Market:**

Let me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There’s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don’t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous “pump and dumps” where stocks become inflated, and based on fool’s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research. 

**Basic Stock Jargons & Short/Long Positions:**

*Long* \- you’re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.

*Short* \- you’re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I’ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:

* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.
* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.
* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is “long” on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.
* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10. 
* Two hypothetical situation happens now:
   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he’s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the “short” lost money, the “long” gained money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the “short” made money, the “long” lost money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
* The above scenarios help to show why “shorts” (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc. 

**Market Manipulation:**

Market manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy “whales” or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are “shorts”. Some are “neutral” and act as lenders to make money, some are “growth-based” and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are “short” which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.

**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**

Market manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.

*Scenario 1:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can “hedge” or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the “premium” or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly “cover”, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.

*Scenario 2:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name “FANG” stocks.

 If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing “newly” purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc. 

*Scenario 3:*

This one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster. 

Algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I’ll start by talking about “market orders” vs “limit orders”. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says “market order” or “limit order”. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a “limit order”, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated. 

In the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it’s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you’re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.

Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management suffered huge losses in May amid a tech-driven sell-off, making the hedge fund’s tough 2022 even worse. The growth-focused flagship fund at Tiger Global tumbled 14.3% in May, bringing its 2022 losses to over 50%, a source familiar with the return told CNBC’s David Faber. In the first quarter, Tiger Global doubled down on a number of tech holdings, including Snowflake, Carvana and Sea, before the market decline got uglier, according to a regulatory filing. Carvana has plummeted 77% in the second quarter so far, while Snowflake is down 44% and Sea is off by more than 30% this quarter.

The tech sector, especially unprofitable firms and richly valued software names, has taken a beating lately in the face of rising rates. Those sharp declines in tech have pushed the Nasdaq Composite down more than 23% year to date and off 26% from its all-time high. Coleman is one of the so-called Tiger Cubs, protegees of legendary hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson.

lgkm5t,stocks,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3,"GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say ""it"" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, ""it"", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including ""synthetic longs"" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a ""what-if"" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many ""what-if's"" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. ""It's two weeks old"". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) ""The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.""

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/25 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes ""just happen"". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), was at the time ""inevitable"" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Beginning of April), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from ""get over it, the squeeze happened"" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

nv3m73,stocks,Take Emotion Out of Trading,"Across the many invest/stock subs there is a lot of meme stock posting going around.  I am not against this by itself, as there is money to be made, but be smart, especially those who are new to this.  

We have all been there, bought a stock at $10 it goes up to $20 and you're like, it will never fall, then it goes to $15 and you say, when it is back to $20, then I'll sell.  You end up selling at $7 for a loss.  

When stocks have these crazy runs, just 'stop-loss limit sell orders.  For example, I'm currently in $CLOV, bought in at $11.65.  It's currently trading at $16.10 at the time of post.  I have a 'stop-loss limit' order at $15.  Meaning, if the stock drops to that level, it sells automatically.  

Of course, it could drop to that level, I sell, and then it rockets to $25, but ignore those.  This will guarantee I can ONLY make a profit.  I HIGHLY recommend you use these automatic sell triggers to prevent yourself from believing STONKS can ONLY go up.  Guarantee you make a profit and while you may be sad when you sell a little early, you will love it when you don't take a loss which I guarantee most of these meme stocks will turn out to be in the long run.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $39.9bn (£32.2bn) for 2022, the highest in its 115-year history.

Energy firms have been making record profits after oil and gas prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The profits have heaped pressure on firms to pay windfall taxes as households struggle with inflation.

Last year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - on the profits of firms to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.

Oil and gas prices had begun to rise after the end of Covid lockdowns but rose sharply after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, resulting in bumper profits for energy companies.

The price of Brent crude oil climbed above $120 a barrel in March 2022, but has fallen back since. Oil prices are now below the level seen before the invasion of Ukraine.

Gas prices remain elevated but have been capped for consumers by the government.

prm2st,stocks,What is your plan to profit from Evergrande collapse?,"Quick summary: Evergrande is a real-estate developer from China that has $305 billion of liabilities and cannot pay of their debt. They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing. Right now, the Chinese government is doing what they can to control the situation (allowing them to default on loans, setting a price floor on property). [https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/)  


Given this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  


(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  


(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  


(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.

To make up for the fewer channels, YouTube TV, owned by Google, has dropped its monthly price for customers by $15 to $50 a month.

gjbmry,stocks,Boeing CEO did not say an airline would go bankrupt in September. Airline stocks crashed due to NBC PR's edited interview.,"Starting yesterday, airline stocks have been tanking-- especially today-- under the claim via multiple news sites that Boeing's CEO, David Calhoun, said an airline would ""most likely"" go bankrupt in September-- based on an [interview from Tuesday's Today Show](https://www.today.com/video/boeing-ceo-it-could-take-3-to-5-years-for-airline-industry-to-return-from-apocalyptic-state-83326533868?mod=article_inline).

This is totally misinformation, that has been unfortunately spread by NBC.

What actually happened is that interviewer Savannah Guthrie, gave a long supposition, and asked Calhoun to agree with it:

>GUTHRIE: The money that the government used to bailout the airlines runs out in September, so they are going to have to start laying off people. Do you expect that the airlines to be able to survive this?   Do you think there might be a major U.S. carrier that just has to go out of business?  
>  
>CALHOUN: **Well, I don't want to get too predictive on that subject**, but yes, most likely. You know, something will have to happen when September comes around... 

She put words into his mouth, and asked two different questions at the same time-- the first being an obvious yes, the second should have been a ""no."" He may have already been primed to answer, as indicated by his stumbling response, then merely blurted out, ""but yes, most likely."" 

Before the full interview was released, [NBC News PR edited the segment in a post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NBCNewsPR/status/1259970858447253505) -- making Calhoun reply, ""Yes, most, likely"" only to the last part, and leaving out the rest of what he said!  

It's a case of unethical editing -- which was then propagated by other sources.

[*USA Today* picked it up](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/05/11/boeing-ceo-predicts-major-airline-go-out-business-coronavirus-pandemic/3113292001/?mod=article_inline), sourcing the NBC News PR Twitter edited version.

Based on the *USA Today* story, [Marketwatch repeated the claim](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-major-us-airline-most-likely-will-go-bankrupt-boeing-ceo-says-in-interview-2020-05-12)

Reuters, usually a trustworthy source, [further spread the misquote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-boeing-airlines/boeing-ceo-sees-passenger-levels-under-25-in-september-pain-for-airlines-nbc-interview-idUSKBN22N31M) which ended up getting reprinted in multiple places.

A writer at *Forbes* then amped the claim, saying Calhoun ""[responded quickly and strongly, “Yes, most likely.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willhorton1/2020/05/12/boeing-ceo-expects-airline-bankruptcy--what-did-he-really-mean-about-coronavirus-impacts/#6c79022d344a)

Boeing had to put out a statement about Calhoun's quote, via spokesman Gordon Johndroe: “He was speaking to the general uncertainty in the sector, not about any one particular airline.” But it was too late -- the damage was already being done to all the industry components.

What was Calhoun thinking, showing up on the TODAY show for an interview, as a new CEO? There was no benefit to his company.

j9udf4,stocks,Apple Launches New iPhones Tuesday. Wall Street Is Pumped,"Tuesday is the day. After many months of investor buildup, Apple is finally about to unveil the first generation of 5G iPhones, which likely will be called iPhone 12.

The details have been widely leaked. Apple ￼ (ticker: AAPL) is expected to unveil four models. Here’s how Raymond James analyst Chris Caso laid it out in a research note last month:

• iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch screen, priced at $699

• iPhone 12 Max, with a 6.1-inch screen, priced at $799

• iPhone 12 Pro, also with a 6.1-inch screen, plus higher end cameras, priced at $999

• iPhone 12 Pro Max, with a 6.6-inch screen, priced at $1,099

There is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there’s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays—the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.

All of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is “Hi, Speed.”) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.

Ives says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks “could be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.”

Ives is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China—he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.

“With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook & Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,” he writes. “Although the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.”

Ives maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will “kick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.”

Muller is also bullish about Apple’s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. “We view Apple’s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,” he writes. “In addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.”

Assuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. “Our revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,” he writes.  “In total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.”

127t85r,stocks,California to require half of all heavy trucks sales to be electric by 2035,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/31/california-requires-half-of-heavy-trucks-sales-to-be-electric-by-2035.html

The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday said it’s granting California the legal authority to require that half of all heavy-duty truck sales in the state be fully electric by 2035, an ambitious standard that will go beyond federal requirements.

The Biden administration’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation comes after the state last year banned the sale of new gasoline-powered cars starting in the same target year of 2035.

The two decisions make California, the country’s most populous state and center of U.S. car culture, a leader in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which generates most of the country’s greenhouse gases.

The California Air Resources Board had sought waivers from the Clean Air Act to set stricter standards for heavy-duty vehicles such as garbage trucks, delivery vans and tractor-trailers. The approval of the new rule will likely have greater impacts beyond California and pave the way for other states to follow suit.

California, which has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy by 2045, has considerable authority over the country’s auto industry. For instance, a federal waiver under the Clean Air Act gives the state authority to adopt stronger fuel economy standards than those of the federal government, which has set the precedent for the rest of the U.S. on how to address vehicle emissions.

The heavy-duty truck rule has already been adopted by six other states — New York, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts and Vermont — all of which were waiting for permission from the Biden administration to enact it.

“Under the Clean Air Act, California has longstanding authority to address pollution from cars and trucks,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. “Today’s announcement allows the state to take additional steps in reducing their transportation emissions through these new regulatory actions.”

The state’s rule requires manufacturers to produce zero-emission trucks beginning in 2024 — three years ahead of the Biden administration’s most recent regulations — and raises production targets through 2035. The rule aims to put 300,000 zero-emission trucks on the road by 2035.

The requirement will curb climate pollution by nearly three million metric tons each year by 2040, according to estimates from the California Air Resources Board. Heavy-duty trucks represent nearly one third of the state’s nitrogen oxide and more than one quarter of its fine particle pollution from diesel fuel.

“California has been hard at work passing landmark regulations to clean our air and protect our climate with zero emissions vehicles, so we’re heartened to see EPA stand with California today and grant this waiver,” Paul Cort, director of Earthjustice’s Right to Zero campaign, said in a statement.

However, some of the country’s major truck manufacturers and their lobbying groups have argued that the requirements to sell a certain percentage of electric heavy-duty trucks are costly and difficult to implement.

The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, an industry group that represents truck and bus manufacturers, has said that the standards would increase the cost of trucks and result in truck buyers delaying decisions to purchase new vehicles.",2023-03-31 17:47:14,2024-02-28 22:10:37.923971,334 days 04:23:23.923971,521,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/127t85r/california_to_require_half_of_all_heavy_trucks/

129pcf4,stocks,Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ Makes Surprise 1 Million-Barrel Oil Production Cut,"DUBAI, April 2 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers on Sunday announced voluntary cuts to their production amounting to around 1.15 million barrels per day in a surprise move they said was aimed at supporting market stability.

The group had been largely expected to stick to its already agreed 2 million bpd cuts when its ministerial panel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, meets virtually on Monday.

Last October, OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, agreed output cuts of 2 million bpd from November until the end of the year, angering Washington as tighter supply boosts oil prices.

The U.S. has argued that the world needs lower prices to support economic growth and prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from earning more revenue to fund the Ukraine war.

Sunday's unexpected voluntary cuts, which start from May, come in addition to the ones already agreed in October.

Riyadh said it would cut output by 500,000 bpd while Iraq will reduce its production by 211,000 bpd, according to official statements.

The UAE said it would cut production by 144,000 bpd, Kuwait announced a cut of 128,000 bpd while Oman announced a cut of 40,000 bpd and Algeria said it would cut its output by 48,000 bpd. Kazakhstan will also cut output by 78,000 bpd.

Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said on Sunday that Moscow would extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023. Moscow announced those cuts unilaterally in February following the introduction of Western price caps.

After Russia's unilateral reductions, U.S. officials said its alliance with other OPEC members was weakening, but Sunday's move shows the cooperation is still strong.

The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement that the kingdom's voluntary cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

Oil prices fell to 15-month lows earlier this month in response to the banking crisis that followed the collapse of two U.S. lenders and resulted in Credit Suisse being rescued by Switzerland's biggest bank UBS.

stzcql,stocks,Google announces privacy changes to Android that will limit user data,"[https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/](https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/)

Summary:

* It's a response to Apple's IDFA change that screwed FB
* Google had to do something because it doesn't want to look bad and Apple has been touting its change as a user privacy benefit
* Google's change is less drastic than Apple's, which was announced without giving any developers notice, and without any options
* Google will focus on limiting the granularity of the user's data available to ads and aggregate more data instead of showing user level data
* Advertisers will still have data, just less of it, and in more aggregated form instead of individual
* For example, Google itself will now scan the user's app usage patterns and create an interests profile of the user. An interest could be stocks or pizza. Then Google will share these interests with advertisers. This means Google now controls that data, instead of a company like Facebook that collected this data themselves. This gives a ton of power to Google.
* Google's change will roll out in 2 years
* It's more advertiser-friendly than what Apple did
* But it's still a net negative to ad companies like FB, Snap, etc over what is there today

One very important thing to note is that Google learned from Apple's change that without cross-platform tracking, advertisers bought more search ads instead because the user's intent was more direct. This led to more business for Google. I [highlighted it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/) why Google was salivating at the thought of doing this on Android too, in order to drive more ad business to its search and weaken Facebook.

Facebook has been renting the penthouse in the Apple Condo building and the Google Condo building. It was a good life. But now the owners of the buildings, Apple and Google, want to take the penthouses back.

**Quick overview of how Apple and Google screwed FB:**

Each user has a unique ID on iOS and one on Android. For example, mine might be 696969.

Many apps use Facebook's ad services. In order to use FB's service, they have to add some Facebook code to their app to track conversions. For example, if I saw an ad for Robinhood on Instagram, I go download the app, I open the app, the little Facebook code on Robinhood will send a message to Zuckerberg HQ that user 696969 has downloaded the app. This allowed advertisers to know how effective each Facebook ad was. Now advertisers have no clue.

It just so happens that this tiny piece of Facebook code will also know that user 696969 opened this app at 7:02 am. And a finance app at 9:00am. A game at 10am.  And so on. Facebook stores this data and starts building a profile of me, even outside of FB, Instagram, and Whatsapp.

Besides ads on IG, FB, and Whatsapp, Facebook also had the Audience Network. If I made a free app, I could show ads from Facebook and split the revenue with Facebook. Previously, Facebook knew exactly who you were even on 3rd party apps because my ID 696969 was still visible. This allowed Facebook to continue to show relevant ads to users. Not anymore.

On iOS, FB has no real way of knowing who is who anymore because it doesn't see 696969 anymore. FB is left on its own. Well played, Apple.

On Android, FB won't see who 696969 is anymore, but FB can request a profile, such as interests, of this anonymous user. But it's now Google that is the one creating a profile of me, and then sharing it anonymously with Facebook. It's a power move by Google. Google is saying to FB, ""you eat what I give you son"". Well played, Google.

v0uo7g,stocks,Conditions Are Ripe for a Deep Bear Market,"The risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence

https://www.wsj.com/articles/conditions-are-ripe-for-a-deep-bear-market-11653166864?mod=hp_trending_now_article_pos1

With the S&P 500 briefly on Friday down 20% from its January peak, it is very tempting to start trying to call the end of the selloff. The problem is that only one of the conditions for a rally is in place, that everyone’s scared. That worked beautifully for timing the start of the 2020 rebound, but this time around may not be enough.

The other requirements are that investors start to see a way through the challenges, and that policy makers start to help. Without those, the risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence.

This time central bankers are scared not by falling markets or the economic outlook, but by ***inflation.*** Sure, if something major breaks in the financial system, they will refocus on finance, and a recession may prompt them to rethink rate rises. But for now, ***inflation means that falling stock prices are seen merely as a side effect of tighter monetary policy, not a reason to invoke the “Fed put” and rescue investors.***

There is nothing magical about a fall of 20%, the usual definition of a bear market. But it does crop up a lot: In the past 40 years, the S&P 500 has bottomed out with a 20%-or-so peak-to-trough decline four times, in 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2018. Another four times it had far bigger losses, as true panic took hold.

***The common factor in the 20% drops was the Federal Reserve. Each time, the market bottomed out when the central bank eased monetary policy, with the stock market’s fall perhaps helping push the Fed to take the threats more seriously then it otherwise might.***

My concern is that this time could be more like 1973-1974. Just as then, the primary concern of the country is inflation, thanks to a war-related oil-price shock. Just as then, the inflationary shock took hold when the Fed had rates far too low given the scale of political stimulus for the economy. Just as then, favored stocks—the Nifty Fifty, now the FANGS and associated acronyms—had soared in prior years.

Most important, in 1974 ***the Fed kept raising rates even as a recession took hold because it was running to catch up with inflation. The result was a horrible bear market interspersed with soul-destroying temporary rallies, two of 10%, two of 8% and two of 7%, each snuffed out. It took 20 months before the low was reached—not coincidentally, when the Fed finally began to get serious about cutting rates.***

To be clear, this article is not predicting a bear market, just saying that conditions are almost optimal for one to occur.  The market can of course stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent if you bet against it.  Regardless, ***Don't Fight the Fed***.",2022-05-30 07:21:07,2024-02-28 22:10:37.924009,639 days 14:49:30.924010,565,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v0uo7g/conditions_are_ripe_for_a_deep_bear_market/
rznlyl,stocks,I don't think people understand what's going on with the Fed / central banks.,"I often read posts / comments from people who talk about the stock market as if it were an isolated entity.  ""It has some good years, it has some bad years, lately we've had good years, there will be bad years, too, but it always goes up over time.""  All of this is true.  But I don't think you can look at the last 13 years or so and say that what we've seen is just business as usual.  It's not.  What we've seen the last 13 years has been entirely unprecedented and has basically been an experiment in monetary policy.

I could make this a long post, but I'll try to make it as simple as possible.  Take a look at the M1 money stock, which over the last 13 years, since the Global Financial Crisis, has increased significantly, and radically so since the Covid-19 pandemic.  (Note that M1 money means ""the most liquid portions of the money supply, containing currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash)

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)

Also interesting to compare the S+P 500 to the M1 money supply: [1. post-2008](https://inukshukcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SP-500-vs-M1-Money-Stock-scaled.jpg),

[2. since Covid-19](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c08c52_b6b1a1d762ed46ef8503dc75f7fdfd22~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_744,h_475,al_c,q_90/c08c52_b6b1a1d762ed46ef8503dc75f7fdfd22~mv2.jpg)

Finally, someone linked an article a few weeks back from an analyst who said we shouldn't be afraid of high rates, but rather low rates, because markets have always been at their worst when rates were low.  This is obviously ridiculous, because that's like saying that we shouldn't be afraid of smoking, but rather chemotherapy, because incidences of cancer are always higher when people are on chemotherapy rather than when they are smoking.  Well of course!  Chemotherapy is the remedy to cancer.  Just as low rates are the remedy to a market downturn.  We would expect that low rates would correlate to market downturns, given that they are the tool we use to stimulate the economy when things aren't going well.

Even so, the author of that article was using the period of 2009 to make his case (worst bear market in history also corresponded to the lowest rates).  But you don't have to be a genius to see the correlation between low rates and stock prices, especially in the last decade:

[https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice484f31450a7fa148b4f1e431e64e1aa.png](https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice484f31450a7fa148b4f1e431e64e1aa.png)

Of course, there's also empirical evidence that this is the case: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2941281](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2941281)

In summary, I don't think you can talk about the stock market in isolation without considering the monetary policy that's fueling it, especially now given that monetary policy has been so dramatic and unprecedented.  Doing so would be like saying ""well bread is usually about $2.50 a loaf, that's gone up over the years but it tends to remain steady in the short to mid term"".  Of course, that's true in the USA.  But in Venezuela such a statement wouldn't hold true.  Not that the US is anywhere near Venezuela, and I'm not calling for hyperinflation or anything like that.  But you have to remember that we're dealing with money here.  Money is not something that holds value on its own, it depends on many other factors, not least of which is monetary policy.  No reasonable discussion of prices, whether of goods and services or assets, is complete without taking into account monetary policy, especially given the nature of what's been going on the last decade.

EDIT: M1 money stock jumped so significantly in May 2020 because of an accounting rule change.  [Please see here](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-fed-isnt-printing-as-much-money-as-you-think/).  Still, the charts I have presented that compare M1 to the S&P 500 do not take into account that change, thus the correlation stands.  [See here.](https://www.ftschuyler.com/single-post/m1-money-supply-vs-s-p-500-index)

tfo9j4,stocks,"Fed hikes rates, signals aggressive turn against inflation","Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-systems-go-feds-liftoff-us-interest-rates-2022-03-16/

WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and projected its policy rate would hit a range between 1.75% and 2% by year's end in a newly aggressive stance against inflation that will push borrowing costs to restrictive levels in 2023.

In a new policy statement marking the end of its full-on battle against the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. central bank flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war in Ukraine and the ongoing health crisis, but still said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation in 40 years.

The statement dropped direct reference to the coronavirus pandemic but instead cited the war in Ukraine as creating ""additional upward pressure on inflation"" and weighing on economic activity.

The interest rate path shown in new projections by policymakers is tougher than expected, reflecting Fed concern about inflation that has moved faster and threatened to become more persistent than expected, and put at risk the central bank's hope for an easy shift out of the emergency policies put in place to fight the fallout from the pandemic.

Even with the tougher rate increases now projected, inflation is expected to remain above the Fed’s 2% target, remaining at 4.1% through this year and dropping only to 2.3% through 2024. Economic growth is seen at 2.8% this year, a sharp drop from the 4.0% growth projected in December.

The unemployment rate is seen dropping to 3.5% this year and remaining there next year, but is projected to rise slightly to 3.6% in 2024.

The new statement said the Fed expects to begin reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet ""at a coming meeting,"" a topic likely to be addressed further by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a news conference due to begin at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).

fi9v4l,stocks,Google is now denying almost everything Trump claimed about their involvement in the screening website during the press conference,"A key bottleneck to the whole coronavirus testing process is online screening.  During the press conference Trump said it was being provided by google with a team of over a thousand engineers getting it working.

Google/Alphabet now is denying all of this with a clarification after the press conference.  Alphabet's subsidiary Verily is just working on screening in a pilot in San Francisco and didn't know at all what the press conference was talking about:

>We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.

Source with more details:

https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19

Leave aside the Google/Alphabet distinction that they mention one time in the article (which is nitpicky for clickbait), and look at this:

>Carolyn Wang, communications lead for Verily, told The Verge that the “triage website” was initially only going to be made available to health care workers instead of the general public. Now that it has been announced the way it was, however, anybody will be able to visit it, she said.

10r2wnp,stocks,"Fed raises rates a quarter point, expects ‘ongoing’ increases","[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/fed-rate-decision-february-2023-quarter-point-hike.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/fed-rate-decision-february-2023-quarter-point-hike.html)

 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication that it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle.  
   
Aligning with market expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point. That takes it to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007.  
   
The move marked the eighth increase in a process that began in March 2022. By itself, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, but it also spills through to many consumer debt products.  


The Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s.  


The post-meeting statement noted that inflation “has eased somewhat but remains elevated,” a tweak on previous language.  
   
Markets, however, were looking to this week’s meeting for signs that the Fed would be ending the rate increases soon. But the statement provided no such signals.  
   
The document included language noting that the FOMC still sees the need for “ongoing increases in the target range.” Market participants had been hoping for some softening of the phrase, but the statement, approved unanimously, kept it intact.  


The statement did alter one part when describing what will determine the future policy path.  


Officials said they would determine the “extent” of future rate increases based on factors such as the effects so far of the rate hikes, the lags in which policy has an impact, and developments in financial conditions and the economy. Previously, the statement said it would use those factors to determine the “pace” of future hikes, a possible nod that the committee sees an end to the increases somewhere, or at least a continuation of smaller moves ahead.  


In 2022, the Fed approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves before going to a smaller 0.5 percentage point increase in December. In recent public statements, multiple officials said they think the Fed at least can scale back on the size of the increases, without signaling when they could end.  


While it was raising its benchmark rate, the committee characterized economic growth as “modest” though it noted only that unemployment “has remained low.” The latest job market assessment omitted previous language that employment gains have been “robust.“  


Otherwise, the statement remained intact from previous messages as the Fed continues its efforts to arrest inflation.  


Fed policy is thought to work on a lag – when the central bank raises rates, it takes time for the economy to adjust to tighter controls on money.  


This particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services. The war in Ukraine aggravated rising gas prices, while unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus fueled rising costs across a variety of goods and services.  


Food prices have risen more than 10% over the past year. Egg prices alone have soared 60%, butter is up more than 31% and lettuce has jumped 25%, according to Labor Department data through December. Gas prices were ticking lower towards the end of 2022 but have popped higher in recent days, hitting $3.50 a gallon nationally for an increase of about 30 cents over the past month, according to AAA.  


Fed officials have remained resolute about tackling inflation, though they have said recent numbers show pressures could be easing. The consumer price index declined 0.1% in December on a monthly basis and is up 6.4% from a year ago – down from the peak of 9% last summer but still well above where the Fed feels comfortable.  


Along with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the holdings in its bond portfolio. That has resulted in a reduction of about $445 billion since June, as the Fed has targeted a capped level of $95 billion in maturing bonds it is allowing to roll off each month rather than reinvest.  


The balance sheet reduction has been the equivalent of about 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes, according to the San Francisco Fed. The balance sheet is still at more than $8.4 trillion.  


Markets are watching for where the Fed will finally end the increases.  


At the December FOMC meeting, committee members indicated they see the “terminal rate,” or point where the Fed thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, as 5.1%. Markets are betting that number is closer to 4.75%, and they expect the Fed to start cutting rates later this year, after one more quarter-point increase in March.

Along with the decision to stay on hold, committee members penciled in at least three rate cuts in 2024, assuming quarter percentage point increments. That's less than the market pricing of four, but more aggressive than what officials had previously indicated.

y2azgl,stocks,"Fed officials expect higher rates to stay in place, meeting minutes show","Federal Reserve officials have been surprised at the pace of inflation and indicated at their last meeting that they expect higher interest rates to remain in place until prices come down, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank’s September meeting.

In discussions leading up to a 0.75 percentage point rate hike, policymakers noted that inflation is especially taking its toll on lower-income Americans.

They reiterated rate hikes are likely to continue and higher rates prevail until the problem is showing signs of resolving.

“Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,” the meeting summary stated.

Officials further noted that with inflation “showing little sign so far of abating … they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals.“

The meeting happened ahead of a recent flow of data showing that inflation pressures do remain elevated, though not at the pace they were earlier this year. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge of consumer price expenditures rose 6.2% from a year ago – 4.9% excluding food and energy – in August, according to data last week that was well above the central bank’s 2% target.

A report Wednesday showed producer prices rose 0.4% in September.

“Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent,” the minutes said. “Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating.“

Members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted at the meeting that the economy needs to slow to get inflation to cool. They lowered their projections for the economy, expecting GDP to grow at just a 0.2% annualized pace in 2022 and just 1.2% in 2023, well below trend and big drop from 2021, which saw the strongest gains since 1984.

They said inflation was being driven by supply chain problems that were not limited to goods but also stressed to a shortage of labor.

However, officials also expressed optimism that policy would help loosen the labor market and bring down prices. Officials have said lately they don’t expect rates to stay high until inflation comes all the way down to 2%.

“Participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in coming years,” the summary said.

The meeting concluded with the FOMC approving its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase, taking benchmark rates to a range of 3%-3.25%. Markets widely expect a similar-size increase to be approved at the next meeting in early November.

Officials did note that they see a point coming when the pace of rate hikes at least will decelerate, though they did not put a time frame on when that will happen.

The minutes said FOMC members noted it “would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation.“

They said that time would come after the fed funds rate had “reached a sufficiently restrictive level,” after which “it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to return to the 2 percent objective.“

The summary of economic projections at the meeting pointed to a “terminal rate,” or end point of rate increases to be around 4.6%. Markets expect the Fed to hike into early 2023 then keep rates there through the year.

Before you downvote, try and wrap your head around the context of the thread.

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:
   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.
   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",2021-05-27 10:38:54,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363167,1007 days 11:31:45.363167,70,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nm4kla/accounting_101_part_2_the_balance_sheet/

15xapyg,stocks,"American workers are demanding almost $80,000 a year to take a new job, a 14% increase over the past year.",">*The amount of money most workers want now to accept a job reached a record high this year, a sign that inflation is alive and well at least in the labor market.*

* The average “reservation wage,” or the minimum acceptable salary offer to switch jobs, rose to a record $78,645 during the second quarter of 2023.
* Employers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year.
* The numbers are significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. 

----------------------------

According to the latest New York Federal Reserve employment survey released Monday, the average “reservation wage,” or the minimum acceptable salary offer to switch jobs, rose to $78,645 during the second quarter of 2023.

That’s an increase of about 8% from just a year ago and is the highest level ever in a data series that goes back to the beginning of 2014. Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.

The number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%.

The New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.

Employers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.

Though there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.

With markets on edge over what the Fed’s next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages “were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement” of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.

Monday’s survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.

Job seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago. That came as job openings fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The likelihood of switching jobs fell, dropping to 10.6% from 11% a year ago, while expectations of being offered a new job also declined, to 18.7% from 21.1%.

sev5l7,stocks,McDonald's - An expensive real-estate company (value $150.90 vs price $248.74),"I went through the annual reports of Mcdonald's for the first time and I'll describe it as an expensive real-estate company that sells branded properties. I'll make my case below.

I will not share the video with my analysis as that would be considered self-promotion.

McDonald's makes money in two ways:

1. Company-owned restaurants - The revenue has significantly decreased in the last decade. This part of the business is related to the restaurants that McDonald's operates and the revenue represents the sales of burgers, fries, beverages, and pretty much everything that is on the menu. It represents about 40% of all the revenue and the operating margin is very low (8%).
2. Franchised restaurants - This is the part that has been increasing over time, now represents the remaining part of the revenue, and has an operating margin of 73%. However, unlike the first business segment, in this one, they make 64% of the revenue from collecting rent and the remaining 36% from royalties.

If you look at the total revenue of the company, you'll see a decline for a decade, accompanied by an increase in the operating profit which is not surprising. Instead of owning the restaurants, McDonald's is renting them to individuals who would like to have their own business and on top of that, they're collecting royalties. So the type of revenue shifted from the low-margin ""Sale of burgers, fries, beverages, shakes, and ice-creams"" to the high-margin ""collecting rent and royalties"".

From an operating profit point of view, 60% comes from rent, 30% from royalties, and 10% from actually company-owned restaurants. Therefore, my conclusion is, that it currently operates as a real estate company that rents branded properties.

After finishing my analysis and preparing my presentation for recording a video, I take some time to do a quick research online on the company, mainly to figure out if I'm missing something. I often stumble upon certain videos and I'm disappointed that many of them have basic checklists without understanding the business and providing value for the viewer. These come mainly in the form of ""Did the revenue increase in the last 5 years? Do we have a P/E of < X"". In the case of McDonald's, if you have a checklist, you would not have a check on the revenue growth in the last 5 years and without understanding the company, you'd have a wrong impression on McDonald's. Finding good investment opportunities takes a lot more than having a simple checklist that most 6-year olds can use.

So, I did value McDonald's based on the following assumptions:

Revenue - 5% growth in the next 6 years, then growing slower after that (Similar to analysts' forecasts for the next few years)

Operating margin - 45% (No significant change compared to the last few years, also in line with the analysts' forecasts)

WACC - 5.91%

Outcome: $150.90/share (Much lower than the current stock price)

Below is an overview of the value of the company based on different assumptions related to revenue growth (in 10 years) & operating margins:

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|45%|50%|55%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|48% ($34.5b)|$150.9|$173.9|$196.8|
|60% ($37.2b)|$161.5|$186.1|$210.7|
|80% ($41.8b)|$178.5|$205.8|$233.0|
|100% ($46.5b)|$165.3|$224.9|$254.8|

I'd like to get your thoughts on the company and see if there's anything significant that I'm missing from my assumptions.

 The parent of Silicon Valley Bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a week after the tech-focused bank failed and was seized by the U.S. government.  

The filing from SVB Financial Group on Friday is not a surprise, with much of the company now under the control of U.S. banking regulators. During the 2008 financial crisis, the parent companies of failed banks Washington Mutual and IndyMac — filed for bankruptcy protection in the days after their banking operations failed.

Also, Silicon Valley Bank along with its CEO and its chief financial officer were targeted this week in a class action lawsuit that claims the company didn’t disclose the risks that future interest rate increases would have on its business.

SVB Financial Group is no longer affiliated with Silicon Valley Bank after its seizure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank’s successor, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, is being run under the jurisdiction of the FDIC and is not included in the Chapter 11 filing.

 The bankruptcy filling by SVB Financial Group will create a legal battle over the bank's remaining assets, between the creditors of the holding company and bank regulators who are looking to make depositors whole. SVB Financial Group believes it has approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity. It also said it also has other valuable investment securities accounts and other assets that are being considered for sale. 

 The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of distressed debt investors — mostly hedge funds — bought up the bonds of Silicon Valley Bank’s holding company in a bet that that there will be some proceeds for bondholders after the bankruptcy process is completed.

“The Chapter 11 process will allow SVB Financial Group to preserve value as it evaluates strategic alternatives for its prized businesses and assets, especially SVB Capital and SVB Securities,” William Kosturos, Chief Restructuring Officer for SVB Financial Group, said in a prepared statement Friday.

SVB Capital is the company’s venture capital and private credit fund. SVB Securities is a regulated broker-dealer. Both continue to operate and have sources of funding, the company said.

The shuttering of Silicon Valley Bank last Friday and of New York's Signature Bank two days later has revived bad memories of the financial crisis that plunged the United States into the Great Recession about 15 years ago.

ifh97i,stocks,We made an automatic stock screener and portfolio tracker to help making decisions,"Hey everyone, my friend and I are very into stocks. We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” > “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock.
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

We hope this is helpful!

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla’s stock. He said it was the first time he’d ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

Laura Goldman, 62, says New York-based analysts missed how much appeal the company holds for a younger generation that’s deeply worried about the climate crisis. Goldman, a former stockbroker, doesn’t even own a car — let alone a Tesla. She bought 300 of the company’s shares in the fall of 2010, a few months after its IPO, and picked up more stock over time.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

p3ozbg,stocks,How is DoorDash a 62 billion company?,"I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash. I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, articles on why this stock is overvalued at 18 price to sales ratio which implies at least 20-25% sales growth (sales growth 6-9x) for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, (because of its unprofitable low margin,no moat, slowing growth business) is trading only 17 billion marketcap more for postmates, uber eats and most dominant ride haling service.(63 vs 80 bil)

With earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but doordash ended the day up 3.5% while airbnb is barely up on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1%, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either.

So why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company) Yet, despite the earnings miss, analysts kept upgrading the price targets for this stock today yet they never explain why they upgraded doordash.

I would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (i enjoy reading opinions on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) Alot of stocks that I believe to have positive sentiment isn't really moving higher, like sofi, disney, shift, alibaba, amazon while stocks that I see have more negative sentiment on youtube/reddit like doordash, carvana, zoom are performing relatively better? (Even Nikola is still worth 4-5 billion somehow)

In short, I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash and why doordash went up on earnings while most stocks went down on earnings (like sofi, ttcf, which is consider to be reasonable valuation but fell 15%)",2021-08-13 16:46:31,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363239,929 days 05:24:08.363239,485,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p3ozbg/how_is_doordash_a_62_billion_company/

To ground myself I wrote a bear case, please help me add to it, ***the stronger we can make the bear case, the more clear we will see the potential opportunity*****.** 

# Macro: 

Ivy will not be released till 2023, developers are not expected to get access till 2022 **Far too early to expect Ivy to benefit BB’s bottom line.** Without it, stock price will not moon.

**Collaboration/partnerships** with 3rd parties (AWS, Biadu, IBM, Hyundai via Motional, Microsoft (crisis management/Microsoft Teams)) to develop technologies, products and services  **may not result in ROI**

Some OEMS and tier 1 customer have accelerated **internal development of embedded solutions** could result in fewer customer orders, loss of market share, pressure to reduce prices, etc

COVID-19 Impact, Chip storage hitting the automobile sector resulting in revenue decrease of 16% in Q3 FY21, **could continue into the future**

**Market is highly competitive**:  IBM, Microsoft, VMware, Mobile Iron, CrowdStrike to name a few

Technology landscape: **evolving customer requirements, high frequency of product introductions by competitors** could leave BB behind

Maintaining key personal: success is dependent on ability to develop/retain skilled employees (executive team, R&amp;D team, experience sales people with specialized knowledge). Competition is intense, has resulted in **solicitation** resulting in higher compensation costs not offset by higher prices

Changes in endpoints, operating systems and applications, security threats and industry standards 

Must obtain/maintain certain product approvals and certifications from government bodies and regulated enterprise customers, although BB is already ISO26262 certified (auto industry)

BBs software runs on \*3rd party operating systems\* (Apple, Google, Microsoft, OEM op systems). **Updates to these op system with limited notice can disrupt operations**, forcing company to divert resources from preexisting product roadmap to accommodate changes 

Meeting debenture covenants

# Financials

Revenues have stalled, **growth is challenged** based on current financials

**BB** (4%) **trails the average revenue when compared to competitors** **in each space** in Enterprise Software (5%) , Licensing &amp; IP (10%), Cybersecurity (10%), Canadian Enterprise Software (9%) per TD Securities equity research

Normalized operating expenses have fluctuated although below average for last 8 qtrs

**Hasn’t reported a profitable qtr since Q4 FY19** (Feb 2019)

Let me know if I missed anything.

Currently holding ~400 shares @ $12, I started buying last week, before WSB happened

**Edit**
New points added from the discussion below and my observation..
 
**Perception: Many retail investors still consider BB a smartphone maker**, John Chen and the BB marketing team need to rebrand to change this perception. Other than their PR releases and twitter, I don’t see much else..i could be wrong..  **Although BB deals with B2B not B2C**, specifically they are niche with OEMs, governments, banks and healthcare.  One could argue no marketing is needed as a result, the security industry is well aware of the best products.
 
WSBs: I’ve been active in the BB community for 2 weeks now, and **ALOT of people are bag holding, ALOT, which is why I believe your seeing so many pumps**, granted BB has been killing it with their constant updates with partnerships..not sure what came first but someone had posted a chart showing the correlation between BB, GME, AMC, and they are moving in sync!
 
BB Cylance (AI and machine learning-based cybersecurity solutions) **was trending down from 20% of revenue in FY20 Q1 to 10% by the end of the FY.

ihc9q7,stocks,Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

----------------

Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index sank below 16,000 points for the first time in more than 13 years after President Xi Jinping strengthened his grip on power with key allies and signalled no let-up in scrutiny over private businesses. A better GDP report failed to cheer traders.  

The Hang Seng Index slumped 5 per cent to 15,401.64 at the local noon trading break, the lowest level since May 2009. The sell-off was the steepest since March 15. The Tech Index tanked 6.7 per cent while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.9 per cent. HSBC added 0.1 per cent before its earnings report.
Alibaba Group plunged 9.8 per cent to HK$62.80, set for a record-low close, and Tencent Holdings slumped 8.3 per cent to HK$213.40. Meituan crashed 11 per cent to HK$125.40. Chinese developers Longfor Group plunged 12 per cent to HK$16.84 and Country Garden lost 7.7 per cent to HK$1.32.  

Xi secured a tradition-breaking third-term as the Communist Party boss after its 20th National Congress over the weekend, and headed a new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) with four close allies, while sidelining Premier Li Keqiang among others.  
  
The risk premium for Chinese stocks in offshore markets “could stay elevated in the short-run, possibly due to investor concerns over the absence of recognised market-oriented economic reformers in the newly-configured PSC,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients.  
  
Xi, in a report to the Congress, had called for “regulating the mechanism of wealth accumulation,” signalling a tighter oversight of private capital following months of crackdown on tech companies, while also pushing his vision for “common prosperity to help close the wealth gap in the nation.
HSBC gained 0.1 per cent to HK$41.60. Pre-tax profit probably dropped 55 per cent from a year earlier, according to market consensus, before its third-quarter report on Tuesday. Standard Chartered retreated 2.4 per cent to HK$48.20, while Bank of China lost 1.5 per cent to HK$2.61, with both reporting later this week.  
  
Consumer stocks led losses on onshore bourses. Liquor distiller Kweichow Moutai tumbled 6 per cent to 1,517.01 yuan and rival Wuliangye Yibin slid 4.6 per cent to 145.17 yuan.  
  
A government report on Monday showed the economy grew 3.9 per cent last quarter, beating market consensus of 3.3 per cent. Retail sales rose by a slower-than-expected 2.5 per cent in September, while industrial output and fixed-asset investment both exceeded expectations.
The data showed “a lack of consumer confidence after frequent pandemic lockdowns,” partly explaining the slump in Alibaba and Tencent share prices, said Dai Ming, an analyst at Huichen Asset Management in Shanghai. “Investors now find it difficult to evaluate the stocks.”",2022-10-24 06:13:06,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363296,492 days 15:57:33.363296,364,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yc3qn9/alibaba_tencent_plunge_as_hang_seng_sinks_below/

If you own Uber stock, gtfo and sell while you're still ahead.  
Countless drivers are reporting on UP and other places that Uber is not paying cancel fees to drivers and not logging the cancelled ride.   Also recently Uber has not been paying tips to drivers and when reported by a driver of the issue, Uber responded ""We are working on a fix for tips not showing up for drivers"".

11yrbvs,stocks,"Fed hikes rates by a quarter percentage point, indicates increases are near an end"," [Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-hikes-rates-by-a-quarter-percentage-point-indicates-increases-are-near-an-end/ar-AA18WXGA?ocid=hpmsn&cvid=9a254d7389014e1196147670c115d53c&ei=14)

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted a quarter percentage point interest rate increase, expressing caution about the recent banking crisis and indicating that hikes are nearing an end.

Along with its ninth hike since March 2022, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted that future increases are not assured and will depend largely on incoming data.

""The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy,"" the FOMC's post-meeting statement said. ""The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.""

That wording is a departure from previous statements which indicated ""ongoing increases"" would be appropriate to bring down inflation.

The softening tone came amid a banking crisis that has raised concerns about the system's stability. The statement noted the likely impact from recent events.

""The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient,"" the committee said. ""Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.""

Despite the warnings about potential implications from the banking crisis, the committee unanimously approved the rate hike.

The increase takes the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range between 4.75%-5%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but feeds through to a multitude of consumer debt like mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

Projections released along with the rate decision point to a peak rate of 5.1%, unchanged from the last estimate in December and indicative that a majority of officials expect only one more rate hike ahead.

Data released along with the statement shows that seven of the 18 Fed officials who submitted estimates for the ""dot plot"" see rates going higher than the 5.1% ""terminal rate.""

The next two years' worth of projections also showed considerable disagreement among members, reflected in a wide dispersion among the ""dots."" Still, the median of the estimates points to a 0.8 percentage point reduction in rates in 2024 and 1.2 percentage points worth of cuts in 2025.

The statement eliminated all references to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Markets had been closely watching the decision, which came with a higher degree of uncertainty than is typical for Fed moves.

Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had indicated that the central bank may have to take a more aggressive path to tame inflation. But a fast-moving banking crisis thwarted any notion of a more hawkish move – and contributed to a general market sentiment that the Fed will be cutting rates before the year comes to a close.

Estimates released Wednesday of where Federal Open Market Committee members see rates, inflation, unemployment and gross domestic product underscored the uncertainty for the policy path.

Officials also tweaked their economic projections. They slightly increases their expectations for inflation, with a 3.3% rate pegged for this year, compared to 3.1% in December. Unemployment was lowered a notch to 4.5%, while the outlook for GDP nudged down to 0.4%.

The estimates for the next two years were little changed, except the GDP projection in 2024 came down to 1.2% from 1.6% in December.

The projections come amid a volatile backdrop.

Despite the banking turmoil and volatile expectations around monetary policy, markets have held their ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up some 2% over the past week, though the 10-year Treasury yield has risen about 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage points, during the same period.

While late-2022 data had pointed to some softening in inflation, recent reports have been less encouraging.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, a favorite inflation gauge for the Fed, rose 0.6% in January and was up 5.4% from a year ago – 4.7% when stripping out food and energy. That's well above the central bank's 2% target, and the data prompted Powell on March 7 to warn that interest rates likely would rise more than expected.

But the banking issues have complicated the decision-making calculus as the Fed's pace of tightening has contributed to liquidity problems.

Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and capital issues at Credit Suisse and First Republic, have raised concerns of the state of the industry.

While big banks are considered well-capitalized, smaller institutions have faced liquidity crunches due to the rapidly rising interest rates that have made otherwise safe long-term investments lose value. Silicon Valley, for instance, had to sell bonds at a loss, triggering a crisis of confidence.

The Fed and other regulators stepped in with emergency measures that seem to have stemmed immediate funding concerns, but worries linger over how deep the damage is among regional banks.

At the same, recession concerns persist as the rate increases work their way through the economic plumbing.

An indicator that the New York Fed produces using the spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasurys puts the chance of a contraction in the next 12 months at about 55% as of the end of February. The yield curve inversion has increased since then.

However, the Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker puts first-quarter growth at 3.2%. Consumers continue to spend – though credit card usage is on the rise – and unemployment has held at 3.6% while payroll growth has been brisk.",2023-03-22 18:09:01,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363311,343 days 04:01:38.363312,464,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11yrbvs/fed_hikes_rates_by_a_quarter_percentage_point/

The Federal Trade Commission’s officials traded stocks and funds more than those at any other major agency, including going heavily into tech shares, The Wall Street Journal found

WSJ Article 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-regulators-of-facebook-google-and-amazon-also-invest-in-the-companies-stocks-11665670207
Oct. 13, 2022 10:10 am ET

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

t9ig7n,stocks,"Biden to ban imports of Russian oil over Ukraine invasion, reports say","President Joe Biden has decided to ban Russian oil imports, reports said Tuesday, as he seeks to ratchet up pressure on Moscow in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky has pleaded with to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, as the Associated Press reported. Oil had been a glaring omission the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion.

Bloomberg reported that the ban will include Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal. The decision was made in consultation with European allies, who rely more heavily than the U.S. on Russian energy, Bloomberg reported.

Biden at 10:45 a.m. will announce “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement Tuesday morning.

The U.S. imported over half a million barrels per day of Russian crude and petroleum products last year, amounting to about 7% of total U.S. imports, according to Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at data firm Kpler. 

“A ban on Russian crude and product imports would have a limited impact on prices, given flows of Russian energy to the U.S. are small in terms of total deliveries, and alternative sources could be found,” Smith recently told MarketWatch.

lfvveo,stocks,Advice for NEW SERIOUS TRADERS,"Hey ya'll. First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. 

Welcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. 

1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.
     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. 
  


2. DD - Due Dilligence 
      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, ""Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there.""
Or another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so ""get in right now!!! 🚀.""
NO. Just no.
I am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research ""Pumping and Dumping"". (Quick Answer.
Please, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  



3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.
     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. 
I know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:

BAD:
Let us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.

Set a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  



4. Educate yourself
     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.
""Any fool can know. The point is to understand."" ~ Albert Einstein.

5. Handling losses. 
     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore.

Apple said earlier this year that it planned to release Mac computers with its own Apple-designed chips based on ARM, instead of Intel processors. Apple’s iPhones and iPads have long used Apple-designed processors, which the company says helps extend battery life and provide faster performance.

Apple could launch a iMac desktop with a new design and laptops using Apple chips, according to a research note from TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published earlier this year.

Mac sales have been a highlight for Apple during the pandemic. In the quarter ending in June, Apple reported $9 billion in Mac sales, which was up 28% year-over-year.

q9cys4,stocks,Why simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing 3 decades of market data to find best DCA Strategy,"By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that

>Time in the market beats timing the market

But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.

**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**

So in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!

___ 

**Analysis**

Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \[1\].

Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)

**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)

**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \[2\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \[3\]

**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \[4\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills

**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \[5\].

Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. 

___

**Results**

Based on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.

**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** 

|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|
|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|
|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|
|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|
|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|
|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|
|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|

 

No matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.

The least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.

___

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).

c. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.

___ 

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \[5,10, 20 years\] and various endpoints \[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.

Since this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.

___ 

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.

\[2\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.

\[3\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds

\[4\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

191zpze,stocks,United Airlines finds loose bolts on several Boeing 737 Max 9s after grounding,"Edit: Alaska is reporting that more of their 737 Max 9's have loose bolts: https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/ (thank you to AP9384629344432 for linking this)

**Original post:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/united-airlines-737-max-9-inspections-turn-up-loose-bolts.html

United Airlines said Monday that it has found loose bolts on door plugs of several Boeing 737 Max 9 planes during inspections spurred when a panel of that type blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight at 16,000 feet last week.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday grounded dozens of 737 Max 9s after the panel blew out midflight on Alaska Flight 1282, calling for inspections.

United has 79 of the Max 9 planes in its fleet and is the biggest operator of the jet model.

""Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug — for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,"" United said in a statement. ""These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service.""

Plane manufacturer Boeing said earlier Monday it issued instructions to airlines to conduct the inspections of the Max 9s in their fleets. United had begun some preliminary inspection work in the past few days.

No one was seriously injured in the accident aboard the Alaska Airlines flight, though the blown-out panel produced a force so violent that some headrests and seatbacks were ripped from the cabin and the cockpit door was flung open, according to initial details of a federal safety investigation. No passengers were seated in the two seats next to the panel.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the accident would have been worse at cruising altitude when passengers and crews are walking around the cabin.

But the accident places fresh scrutiny on Boeing, which has spent years trying to clean up a host of quality defects, while also ramping up aircraft production, including of the 737 Max. CEO Dave Calhoun has spent months trying to assure airlines, investors and financial analysts that the company is improving its supply chain and working to resolve its quality problems.

Calhoun canceled a company leadership summit this week and plans to hold an all-employee call on Tuesday.

Alaska Airlines, which is set to inspect its fleet of more than 60 737 Max 9s, didn't immediately comment on whether it, too, has found loose bolts.

The FAA declined to comment on United's findings. Boeing didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The 737 Max is Boeing's best-selling aircraft, with more than 4,000 orders to fill. However, the more common Max 8, which is not affected by the grounding, makes up the majority of those orders.

Aviation publication The Air Current first reported that United had discovered the loose bolts.",2024-01-08 23:35:26,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363442,50 days 22:35:13.363442,218,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191zpze/united_airlines_finds_loose_bolts_on_several/

It hasn't been this low since 2009. Does this mean that people are running out of money to spend? Hence, we could see inflation slow down now because people can't afford excessive purchases anymore. People have exhausted their covid money and then some.

The $4.8 trillion during covid was caused by people's fears of the economy collapsing so they saved, stimulus checks, and the lack of things to spend their money on due to stay-at-home orders.

Also, it's quite shocking to see how Americans are able to spend their money so fast. It's as if people thought the boom was going to last forever and that they weren't ever going to run out of money. The average American can't seem to see beyond the next 3 months. Personally, my savings have actually increased because I didn't believe this boom would last forever.

There is a theory on inflation that suggests inflation is partly psychological and not based in reality. People and businesses just expect inflation after a while so workers continuously ask for higher wages which in turn causes businesses to charge higher prices. Here, we can see that people actually have less money now to spend than in 2009. To break this cycle, the fed needs to provide an interest rate shock like what Volcker did. \[0\]\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]

**The main question is: is there a correlation between personal savings and inflation? Another question is if personal savings is now so low, why are people still spending so much? Is is because of their gain in home equity (which is still far above 2019) that is making people ""feel"" rich?**

Intro:

> If all goes according to plan, Thomas Healy, 28, will become America’s youngest self-made billionaire next week

Excerpts:

> According to SEC filings, Healy will be the biggest shareholder, with 22.9% of the company, or 34.97 million shares, worth nearly $1.5 billion. 

> He may not be as slick as the other billionaire electric truck impresarios Elon Musk or Nikola’s disgraced former CEO Trevor Milton, but Healy has one up on both Tesla and Nikola when it comes to getting revolutionary tech onto the road. There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion’s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.

Also:

> Healy’s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy’s approach contrasts with the field’s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.

And:

> Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana’s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell still sees interest rate hikes coming, but noted Wednesday that the Russia-Ukraine war has injected uncertainty into the outlook.

In remarks prepared for dual appearances this week before House and Senate committees in Congress, the central bank chief acknowledged the “tremendous hardship” the Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing.


“The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, and we will be monitoring the situation closely,” Powell said.

“The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,” he added. “Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.”

The remarks come amid 40-year highs for inflation in the U.S., complicated by a Ukraine war that has driven oil prices to around their highest levels in a decade. Consumer prices increased 7.5% from a year ago in January, and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showed its strongest 12-month gain since 1983.

Powell and his fellow policymakers have been indicating for weeks that they plan to start raising benchmark interest rates to tackle inflation. He reiterated the stance Wednesday that the process will involve “interest rate increases,” along with indications that the Fed eventually will start reducing its bond holdings.

“We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market,” he said. “We have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.”

Inflation still expected to fall

The Fed will start cutting the size of its asset holdings after rate hikes have begun, he added.

Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the Fed has been buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at the fastest pace ever, driving the total holdings on the central bank balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion.

Powell said the reduction will be conducted “in a predictable manner,” largely through allowing some proceeds from the bonds to roll off each month rather than reinvesting them.

On the economy, the chairman said he still expects inflation to decelerate through the year as supply chain issues are resolved. He called the labor market “extremely tight” and noted strong wage gains, particularly for lower earners and minorities.

The year 2021 “is shaping up to be a critical year for EV adoption and (internal combustion engine) de-adoption that will dictate the pace of multiple expansion, contraction, consolidation and proliferation” among the stocks, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in the note.

ufe7kd,stocks,For a reminder: We are just 13% off the ATH on the S&P500,"Hi,

The last few days, this forum was dominated by ""long-term"" mindset and that things are close to bottoming. 

First: It is impossible to properly time the market. Good diversification (countries and asset classes) can take out the tail events. The market might go down 50% or it might go up 50% the next two years. It is impossible to know tho.

Second: With inflation and world events, there are a lot of things to worry. A 13% dip in the S&P500 is just a correction. Things can get a lot worse. There was an upvoted post, saying that the sentiment on AAII was at the bottom of 2009. What they are not telling you, is have you invest at a similar level in 2008, you would have lost 43%.  It can get a lot worse

For the last two decades, the world had loose monetary policies and increased globalisation. It seems that some of that is reversing. 

The valuation and price of what you pay in the end determines your return. It was ok to buy anything and it would go up, but it looks like valuations are starting to come back to more reasonable levels (30 PE should be reserved for the highest growing companies).",2022-04-30 16:08:19,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363491,669 days 06:02:20.363491,381,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ufe7kd/for_a_reminder_we_are_just_13_off_the_ath_on_the/
13vr1zd,stocks,Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs.

Intel announced Wednesday it will be cutting its quarterly dividend by 66%, saying the move “reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation.”

Intel will be cutting its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a share , down 66% from its previous dividend of 36.5 cents.


“The decision to decrease the quarterly dividend reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation and is designed to best position the company to create long-term value. The improved financial flexibility will support the critical investments needed to execute Intel’s transformation during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty,” Intel said in a press release.

Intel reiterated it expects an adjusted first-quarter loss of 15 cents a share on revenue between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion.

u62jcy,stocks,"Elon Musk’s tweets about taking Tesla private in 2018 were false, new court filing says","https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/16/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweets-ruled-false-new-court-filing-suggests.html

In a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit. The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Tesla’s stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.

Damages from the shareholders’ class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class. The shareholders’ attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter — in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted. This information was revealed in a request the shareholders’ lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14. Musk also said, “The SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that’s like having a gun to your child’s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.” 

It’s not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time. Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion. Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: “Nothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech.”",2022-04-18 02:27:53,2024-02-28 22:10:39.363534,681 days 19:42:46.363534,341,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u62jcy/elon_musks_tweets_about_taking_tesla_private_in/
