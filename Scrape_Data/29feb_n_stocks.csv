1b31r82,stocks,"Birkenstock beats revenue expectations on higher pricing, U.S. demand","Birkenstock on Thursday beat holiday quarter revenue expectations, reporting a 22% year-on-year jump, as the German sandal company benefited from higher pricing and rising U.S. demand.

As a newly public company, Birkenstock is still getting into a public reporting rhythm and only just released its fiscal 2023 results and 2024 guidance a little over a month ago. On Thursday, it said it stands by guidance issued then and still expects sales to be between 1.74 billion euros ($1.89 billion) and 1.76 billion euros ($1.91 billion), representing growth of 17% to 18%.

Here’s how the shoemaker did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 9 euro cents adjusted vs. 9 euro cents expected

Revenue: 302.9 million euros vs. 288.7 million euros expected.

The company reported a net loss of 7.15 million euros ($7.75 million) for the three-month period that ended December 31, or a loss of 4 euro cents per share. A year earlier, it reported a loss of 9.19 million euros ($9.96 million), or a loss of 5 euro cents per share. Excluding one time items, Birkenstock reported a profit of 17 million euros ($18.4 million) or 9 euro cents per share.

Sales rose to 302.9 million euros ($328.5 million), up 22% from 248.5 million euros ($269.4 million) a year earlier.

CEO Oliver Reichert has said the company deliberately engineers its distribution strategy so demand is higher than supply but its working to build out its production capabilities to narrow that gap. The chief executive said those investments, along with other efforts the company is undertaking to drive growth, is having a “planned” but “temporary” impact to profitability.

“Our results for the first quarter of 2024 once again demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strong sustained demand for our products. Given our engineered distribution model, demand continues to outpace supply in all regions, channels and categories,” said Reichert. “In the medium-term, we are confident we will continue to deliver our objectives of a gross profit margin over 60% and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the low thirties percent.”

The company’s gross profit margin inched down to 61% from 61.7% during the same period last year, with Birkenstock citing “unfavorable currency translation and the planned, temporary under-absorption from our ongoing capacity expansion.” The company said it continues to carefully track input costs and is mitigating inflationary pressures with “executed, selective price increases.”

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% year-on-year to 81 million euros, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9%, down from 29.1% a year earlier.

The newly public shoemaker, which started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BIRK” in October, saw a muted debut when it first hit the public markets, with shares sliding more than 12% on its first day as a public company. Shares have since rebounded and are up more than 5% this year, as of the Wednesday close. 

In January, the company reported its fiscal 2023 results and said it was the most successful year in the company’s nearly 250-year long history. Sales grew 20% and the retailer made strides in growing its direct-to-consumer business, which comes with better profits and more customer insights than relying on wholesale partners. 

During the quarter, Birkenstock saw more gains in its direct channels and said DTC sales accounted for 53% of overall revenue.

As other retailers like Nike, Under Armour and Timberland-owner VF Corp contend with soft demand in North America, Birkenstock reported outsized strength in the region with sales up 21% during fiscal 2023. That momentum continued during its fiscal first quarter with sales up 14% in the region. In Europe, where demand in some parts has been softer than in North America, sales grew 32%, and in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, revenue jumped 47%.

The recent growth comes several years after private equity powerhouse L Catterton acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock in 2021, ending nearly 250 years of family ownership that began when German cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock founded the company in 1774. 

Birkenstock’s new owners set off on an aggressive growth strategy that focused on growing direct-to-consumer sales, exiting certain wholesale partnerships and focusing on driving sales of items with higher price points. Within a few years, its sales nearly doubled and its market cap is now around $9.7 billion, double its 2021 valuation of $4.85 billion. 

Since going public, Birkenstock has used some of its proceeds to pay down debt. In the fall, it made a number of debt payments that reduced its net leverage. As of the end of December, Birkenstock was levered at 2.6 times EBITDA.

1b31nk9,stocks,"Key Fed inflation measure rose 0.4% in January as expected, up 2.8% from a year ago","[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html)

Inflation rose in line with expectations in January, according to an important gauge the Federal Reserve uses as it deliberates cutting interest rates.  
  
The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs increased 0.4% for the month and 2.8% from a year ago, as expected according to the Dow Jones consensus estimates.  
  
Headline PCE, including the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.3% monthly and 2.4% on a 12-month basis, compared with respective estimates for 0.3% and 2.4%, according to the numbers released Thursday by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.  
  
The moves came amid an unexpected jump in personal income, which rose 1%, well above the forecast for 0.3%. Spending decreased 0.1% versus the estimate for a 0.2% gain.  
  
January’s price rises reflected an ongoing shift to services over goods as the economy normalizes from the Covid pandemic disruptions.  
  
Services prices increased 0.6% on the month while goods fell 0.2%; on a 12-month basis, services rose 3.9% and goods were down 0.5%. Within those categories, food prices accelerated 0.5%, offset by a 1.4% slide in energy. On a year-over-year basis, food was up 1.4% while energy fell 4.9%.  
  
Both the headline and core measures remain ahead of the Fed’s goal for 2% annual inflation. While the Fed officially uses the headline measure, policymakers tend to pay more attention to core as a better indication of where long-term trends are heading.  
  
Wall Street reacted little to the news, with stock market futures up slightly and Treasury yields slightly higher. Futures markets where traders bet on the direction of interest rates also indicated little movement, with pricing tilted toward the Fed’s first rate cut coming in June.  
  
“Overall, \[the report\] is meeting the expectations, and some of the worst fears in the market weren’t met,” said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Société Générale. “The key is we’re not seeing the broad nature of increases that we had been more fearful of.”  
  
Thursday’s BEA report also showed that consumers are continuing to dip into savings as prices stay elevated. The personal savings rate was 3.8% on the month, slightly higher than December but off a full percentage point from where it was as recently as June 2023.  
  
In other economic news, a Labor Department report showed that companies are still reluctant to lay off workers.  
  
Initial jobless claims totaled 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 24, up 13,000 from the previous period and more than the 210,000 Dow Jones estimate but still largely in keeping with recent trends. However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, rose to just above 1.9 million, a gain of 45,000 and higher than the FactSet estimate for 1.88 million.  
  
The reports come as central bank officials mull the future of monetary policy following 11 interest rate increases totaling 5.25 percentage points. Running from March 2022 to July 2023, the hikes came as the Fed battled inflation that peaked at a more than 40-year high in mid-2022.  
  
Officials have said in recent days that they expect to begin reversing the increases at some point this year. However, the timing and extent of the policy easing is uncertain as recent data has indicated that inflation could be more stubborn than expected.  
  
January’s consumer price index data raised fears of persistently high inflation, though many economists saw the rise as impacted by seasonal factors and shelter increases unlikely to persist.  
  
While the CPI is used as an input to the PCE, Fed officials focus more on the latter as it adjusts for substitutions consumers make for goods and services as prices fall. Where the CPI is viewed as a simpler price measure, the PCE is viewed as more representative of what people are actually buying",2024-02-29 14:30:37,2024-02-29 15:29:42.624875,0 days 00:59:05.624876,29,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b31nk9/key_fed_inflation_measure_rose_04_in_january_as/

1b2knaw,stocks,"EA to lay off 5% of workforce, or about 670 employees","Electronic Arts
 announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games.

EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.

The company’s announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. 

On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent’s Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is “streamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.”

The cuts will support EA’s “strategic priorities and growth initiatives,” according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be “substantially complete” by the end of December.

“We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,” Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. “We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.”

Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its “biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.” 

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.

1b2k50m,stocks,"""Iger Slashes Disney Stake by 80%"" ... but did he really?","(edit: no, he really didn't. more at the bottom.)

According to this article (among others) Bob Iger sold off 80% of his shares in the past 12 months. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ceo-bob-iger-slashes-disney-stake-by-80/ar-BB1iUSR0

Allegedly going from over a million shares to 186,674 shares...

But wait.... according to the SEC filings, he has direct ownership of 166,166 shares at the end of 2022, and almost 184,260 shares in January of 2024. His indirect shares (wife and 401k) have no remarkable change either.  

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000244/xslF345X03/wf-form4_167218565155675.xml

He does seem to have drastically reduced his position across the course of 2022 but the records are confusing to me. 

He had 886,531 shares after his tax sales at the beginning of the year, but then near the end of the year -- with no recorded Form 4 transactions intervening -- he files a new Form 3 with only 150,000 shares. I didn't think he could sell without filing Form 4, but the share count certainly went down.  Maybe the Form 3 restates no longer available Form 4s, or the transactions were on some other kind of filing? Maybe they were given away and not sold (for example put into trusts for children or charity as shares, without ever being sold).


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000024/xslF345X03/wf-form4_164134884768001.xml

I have a lot of questions, but what I mostly want to know is, is this journalist misreading the data or am I? Did Iger really sell heavily in 2023-2024, and why did his share count change with little record in 2022?

(Or perhaps this article is a repost with a new date, changing it from something that *was* true at some particular point in time to something that is misleading? The specific numbers still don't make sense to me, but the broad outline would.)


Edit: It looks like he did not. Thanks to u/Puzzleheaded_War6849 who found the source of the number in a 14A filing from January 2022, and reminded me of Iger's retirement. There's no record of his sales in 2022 because he *wasn't an insider* until he was re-hired towards the end of the year, hence filing a new 'initial' declaration of holdings on November 20th, 2022.  This means that the article is using old data (whether it's a republished article or a confused journalist I don't know).  We could speculate that Iger did not trust Chapek's leadership since he was heavily selling during his time outside the company, but we cannot draw any conclusions about the current direction of Disney.

1b2jxx5,stocks,Top ex-Disney exec Kevin Mayer tipped prime contender to succeed Iger. He just headed the negotiations to merge Disney-India with Reliance.,"***Kevin Mayer***, *a prime contender in the race to succeed Bob Iger as Disney's CEO, has mapped out what he sees as the must-have traits for the next chief executive officer of the Mouse House*.

*Boasting a rich history with the entertainment behemoth dating back to 1992, Mayer’s track record is punctuated by pivotal roles in orchestrating game-changing mergers and acquisitions, including groundbreaking deals for Marvel, Pixar, and key assets of 21st Century Fox.*

*He also played a crucial role in steering the launch of Disney+, a seismic shift that reshaped the company's digital landscape. Exiting Disney in 2020 to helm short-form video platform TikTok, Mayer's tenure was cut short amidst escalating pressure from the Trump administration over the platform's ties to China, prompting his swift departure.*

*Mayer has since redirected his expertise toward the booming realms of streaming and digital content as the founder and CEO of Candle Media, boasting an impressive portfolio featuring the likes of Reese Witherspoon's media venture Hello Sunshine and global kids' entertainment titan Moonbug, home to popular franchises such as Cocomelon and Blippi.*

*Having returned to the Disney fold as a strategic advisor to Iger last year, Mayer's insights have become increasingly coveted amidst continuing speculation surrounding his old boss’s succession.*

***The 3 traits Disney's next CEO must have***

*Speaking on stage with Fortune’s Massimo Marioni at Web Summit Qatar, Mayer outlined three indispensable attributes necessary for the next occupant of one of the world’s most coveted corner offices.*

*""Bob is tough to replace. We saw that the first time around,"" acknowledged Mayer, reflecting on the turbulent tenure of Bob Chapek, who replaced Iger in 2020 before leaving in 2022.*

*""Bob \[Iger\] is an incredibly capable CEO. He knows the company inside out. He and I made those content acquisitions that really changed the face of not only Disney, but also the entertainment industry in many ways.*

*“A Disney CEO really has to understand brands. The influence and power that they have. And the responsibility that goes along with having those brands.""*

***'No one is irreplaceable'***

*Furthermore, Mayer underscored the imperative for a fusion of creativity and shrewd business acumen to navigate Disney's multifaceted operations spanning theme parks, streaming, paid TV, channels, consumer products, and sports.*

*""They have to be creative but also a substantially sophisticated businessperson. It’s a multifaceted company,"" he added.*

*Acknowledging the daunting task of filling Iger's formidable shoes, Mayer said: ""Bob's a great CEO and very difficult to replace, but no one is irreplaceable.""*

*Pressed on his potential candidacy, Mayer remained coy, quipping: ""No comment on that, but I spent a lot of time there.""*

1b2jned,stocks,"Paramount falls short on revenue but posts profit, strong streaming results","Paramount Global missed revenue expectations for the fourth quarter on Wednesday but posted a surprise quarterly profit and posted strong results from its streaming platform Paramount+.

Here’s how Paramount performed in the fourth quarter compared to Wall Street estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. an expected loss of 1 cent

Revenue: $7.64 billion vs. $7.85 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Paramount reported a profit of $514 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $21 million, or 1 cent per share, the year prior. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share were 4 cents for the period.

Paramount — home to brands such as CBS, Showtime, BET, Nickelodeon and its namesake movie studio — reported a 6% year-over-year revenue decline but posted notable strides in its streaming segment.

Paramount+, its flagship streaming service, reached 67.5 million subscribers during the period, a net increase of 4.1 million, and recorded 69% revenue growth year over year. The company expects to achieve profitability for Paramount+ by 2025, it said Wednesday.

Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew 43%, partially driven by price increases, and revenue across its entire direct-to-consumer segment grew 34%.

Paramount saw a 27% jump in global viewing hours across Paramount+ and Pluto TV during the fourth quarter.

“Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on maximizing the return on our content investments and scaling streaming, while transforming the cost base of our business,” CEO Bob Bakish said in a press release. “And I couldn’t be more thrilled with the early momentum we’ve had across every platform in 2024, demonstrating the power of our strategy and assets.”

Paramount has been exploring sale options for all or parts of its business in recent months as the media landscape rapidly changes. Paramount has struggled without a solid growth narrative, with shares down more than 50% over the past two years.

Warner Bros. Discovery had been in preliminary talks to acquire Paramount, but those talks have since halted, CNBC’s Alex Sherman reported Tuesday.

Paramount announced about 800 layoffs earlier this month, just a day after the company revealed it had reached record viewership numbers for this year’s Super Bowl.

The company on Wednesday reported its TV media revenue declined 12% year over year. Advertising revenue declined 15% due to overall “softness in the global advertising market and 5-percentage point impact from lower political advertising,” according to the earnings release.

Revenue in Paramount’s filmed entertainment sector sank 31% year over year, driven by lower licensing revenue.

Salesforce’s revenue grew 10.8% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, compared with a loss of $98 million, or 10 cents per share.

During the quarter, Salesforce said it would acquire sales commission software startup Spiff for undisclosed terms and was starting to sell its products on the Amazon Web Services marketplace.

Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.37 to $2.39 per share, with $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been expecting $2.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.15 billion in revenue.

For the new 2025 fiscal year, Salesforce said it sees adjusted earnings of $9.68 to $9.76 per share and $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion in revenue. The revenue figure implies 8.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts had expected $9.57 per share, along with $38.62 billion in revenue.

Excluding the after-hours move, Salesforce shares have risen about 14% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 6% over the same period.

In my case:

Belief: 

Clinuvel (CUV) is an obscure Australian Pharma stock. They are profitable because they provide a treatment for people with extreme light sensitivity (EPP) which is small but very profitable as they are the only treatment. Their medicine Scenesse (afamelanotide) basically makes you tanned, makes you loose appetite and gives you a hard-on (my personal experience). They are working on a treatment for vitiglio (I'm confident it will work) and stroke (unsure) which are much bigger markets. By now I had expected that big Pharma would have bought them out years ago but it hasn't happened and at this stage their is a large change current management will do something dumb with the cash on hand, hence I'm thinking of trimming my position because the stock has been going nowhere for years...

1b2adtt,stocks,"Polestar raises almost $1 billion, sees margins improving in 2024, $PSNY up 27% since Wednesday’s market open","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/polestar-raises-almost-1-billion-142243111.html

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) — Polestar said on Wednesday it had raised a $950 million loan from a bank syndicate, helping to fill a gap left when Volvo Cars said it would stop funding the electric carmaker.

New York-listed shares of the Swedish EV maker rose over 25% after the news.

Polestar also forecast double-digit gross profit margins by the end of 2024, against an expected flat outcome in 2023.

Investors' enthusiasm for EV makers has cooled as growth in EV sales has slowed and financial losses have piled up, making life especially hard for startups. Price cuts by leading players Tesla and BYD have added to the pressure.

""It is crucial for us to be able to concentrate on rolling out our car programs, and it provides the funds needed to complete the model program that we have with Polestar 2,3 and 4 this year, and the 5 joining in 2025,"" CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters.

Polestar differs from many pure-play EV startups in that it has had two strong financial backers that co-founded the company, Volvo Cars and Geely Holding.

However, it has still struggled, which has led to target misses and job cuts.

The fresh funding comes at a crucial time after Volvo said this month it would cease further funding of Polestar, and hand over most of its stake to its shareholders such as Geely.

The three-year loan facility from 12 international banks is intended to help Polestar achieve its goal of cash flow break-even in 2025. In the auto industry, a carmaker can spend $1 billion to develop a single model.

Polestar had previously said it would need $1.3 billion in external funding to break even in 2025.

Geely CEO Daniel Li, also a Polestar board member, said the Chinese automaker would continue backing Polestar.

""Geely will continue to provide full operational and financial support to the iconic performance car brand going forward,"" Li said in Polestar's statement.

""We will retain our shares in Polestar and intend to participate in future financing activities when required,"" he added. ""Polestar will have full access to technologies and engineering expertise from Geely Holding to realise its global growth targets.""

Banks extending the loan to Polestar include BNP Paribas, Natixis, Standard Chartered, BBVA, HSBC, and SPDB.

Polestar said it expected volume growth this year that would support its target for 2025 of more than 155,000 vehicles annually.

""Volume and margin progression are expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2024, as the two SUVs reach full production and global distribution,"" the company said, referring to the Polestar 3 and 4 models coming this year.

1b2a7g3,stocks,"First Solar jumps on strong quarter, record backlog","First Solar shares jumped Wednesday after reporting another solid quarter, with the company booked solid through 2026 and an order backlog that stretches into the end of the decade.

The stock traded as much as 9% higher on the day. It was last up about 2%.

Here’s how the company did in the fourth quarter:

Net income rose 30% year over year to $349.2 million from $268.3 million

Earnings per share of $3.25 beat an LSEG estimate of $3.13

Revenue of $1.15 billion was slightly below a consensus forecast of $1.31 billion

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said the revenue miss was more than offset by strong margins of 43.3%, compared to consensus estimates of 37.7%.

First Solar has a record order backlog of 80.1 gigawatts stretching through the end of the decade with the company completely booked through the next two years.

First Solar is one of the few companies that has weathered the sharp downturn in the solar sector. While the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) has plummeted 43% over the past 12 months, First Solar is down 6.2% over the same period.

High interest rates pummeled the highly leveraged residential solar sector, but First Solar’s focus on large, utility-scale projects has insulated the company from the macroeconomic headwinds.

“We continue to believe FSLRs extended visibility into margin levels and cash flows provides a relative safe haven for investors,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse told clients in a note. JPMorgan has a price target of $226 for the stock, implying about 56% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets on the back of First Solar’s quarterly report. Deutsche sees First Solar rising to 44% to $210 per share, while Morgan Stanley is expects upside of 69% to $245 per share.

“The company message is clear and loud - solid growth ahead, with increased capacity coming online and two new US facilities being built up,” Deutsche analyst Corinne Blanchard told clients Wednesday.

“FSLR is utility exposed, and therefore we believe isolated from the current ongoing challenges for the rest of the solar space,” Blanchard wrote. “The company also has a solid balance sheet, therefore reducing macro related headwinds.”

But there are potential headwinds on the horizon with bookings expected to slow after two bumper years. CFO Alexander Bradley told analysts on the company’s earnings call that First Solar will be “highly selective” with its contracting in 2024 as U.S. presidential and congressional elections later this year create uncertainty for the renewable sector.

Analysts are worried that Republicans might seek to weaken or repeal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act if they win unified control of government.

And CEO Mark Widmar told analysts that Chinese subsidization and dumping has led to a collapse in cell and module in key international markets such as India and Europe.

Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for First Solar to $265 from $275 prior despite the company’s strong quarter. The investment bank said solar module oversupply and potential changes to U.S. tax credits are key risks for First Solar moving forward.

I only invest in companies that I'm confident in long-term, and I've never sold any shares. My plan is to just buy and hold. I have no doubt that if I keep investing regularly, I'll become a millionaire in my forties or fifties. However, this would only be on paper.

Of course one might argue that I could just take some small profits by selling 5% of my positions in a stock that's gone up by a lot for example. But I would counter that unless I invested a ridiculously large sum of money, selling 5% of a position will not make me 'rich'. For example if my portfolio grows to $1M and I want to buy a house for $1M, I'll have to sell off all my shares and I'll have to start from scratch again.

1b27suh,stocks,Stripe all but delays IPO. Valuation rises to $65B,"

Feb 28 (Reuters) - Stripe's valuation surged to $65 billion in a deal that will allow some of its employees to cash out their stock in the company, the payments service provider said on Wednesday.
The so-called ""tender offer"" could allow Stripe more flexibility with its plans to file for an initial public offering (IPO), which investors and analysts have been anticipating for years.
Stock-based payouts typically comprise a big chunk of the compensation for startup employees, who have no way of converting their shares into cash unless their employer files for an IPO, raises funds in a private round or buys back their shares.
Stripe and some of its investors have agreed to buy some shares of current and former Stripe employees, the company said.
It did not disclose the names of the investors participating in the round. But the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the deal, said Sequoia Capital and Goldman Sachs's growth equity fund were involved.
Stripe declined to comment beyond its statement.
The company was valued at $50 billion in its last funding round in 2023 where it raised $6.5 billion. It had then said that it did not need the capital to run its business but would use it to cover a tax bill and to provide liquidity to employees.

1b26q3r,stocks,"Novavax misses quarterly estimates, but vaccine maker narrows losses as it slashes costs","Vaccine maker Novavax on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that missed Wall Street’s estimates and reiterated plans to cut costs as it fights to stay afloat. 

Still, Novavax narrowed its losses in the quarter from the same period a year ago, even as demand for the biotech company’s Covid vaccine – its only marketable product – and other products that combat the virus continue to plummet worldwide. 

Here’s what Novavax reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: $1.44 vs. a loss of 45 cents expected

Revenue: $291.3 million vs. $322 million expected

The company posted a net loss of $178.4 million, or $1.44 per share, for the quarter. That compares to a net loss of $182.2 million, or $2.28 per share, for the year-earlier quarter. 

Novavax generated fourth-quarter sales of $291.3 million, down from the $357.4 million in the year-earlier period. 

But Novavax CEO John Jacobs said the company had some revenue move from 2023 into 2024 due to the timing of some advance purchase agreements for doses of its Covid shot. 

“I wouldn’t look at it as sales that were lost ... but there’s much more of a timing element than anything else,” Jacobs told CNBC in an interview. 

Novavax expects full-year 2024 revenue to come in between $800 million and $1 billion. That forecast reflects an expected $500 million to $600 million in revenue from advanced purchase agreements and $300 million to $400 million from commercial market product sales, royalties and other revenue from the company’s “partner-related activity.” 

Analysts surveyed by LSEG expect 2024 revenue of $969.6 million. 

Novavax expects first-quarter revenue to come in at $100 million, which reflects the tail end of the current Covid vaccination season. The company previously expected $300 million in sales for the period.

Novavax reiterated its plans to slash more expenses this year as part of the global cost-cutting plan it launched last year. 

The company plans to lower its combined research and development as well as selling, general and administrative expenses to a range of $700 million to $800 million in 2024. 

Novavax already shaved down those combined expenses to $1.21 billion last year. That’s $150 million more than the company’s initial target for those expenses, Jacobs noted. Those combined expenses came in at $1.69 billion in 2022. 

The company also reduced its operating expenses in 2023 by $1.1 billion, or 41%, compared to 2022. It also cut its workforce by 30% compared to the first quarter of 2023. 

The cuts will help Novavax focus on further developing its combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu, which it plans to launch in 2026. The company expects to start a late-stage trial on that shot in the second half of the year.

Jacobs said that combination jab will open up a market that ranges between 120 and 140 million doses a year. The company’s data suggests that a large portion of people who receive separate Covid and flu shots will convert to combination options, he added.

The results come a year after the biotech company first raised concerns about its ability to stay in business. Shares of Novavax fell more than 50% last year. 

But the stock got a huge boost last week after it eliminated what some analysts considered one of the biggest uncertainties around the company. 

On Thursday, Novavax said it will settle a bitter arbitration dispute with Gavi, a nongovernmental global vaccine organization, over a canceled Covid vaccine purchase agreement. Novavax could pay around $300 to $400 million to the organization, but the total amount may be less if Gavi decides to order more shots from the company over the next five years.

If Novavax gets to settle part of the arbitration through vaccine orders, the company will be able to set a price for those doses, Jacobs said.

“We get to set that price and it allows us to control the economics of that,” he said, adding that “it would be a quite favorable way to settle that agreement through doses and again, that helps fulfill the mission” of distributing shots more equitably in lower-income countries.

Sales rose to $16.41 billion, up about 13% from $14.52 billion a year earlier. The prior-year period’s sales included one fewer week.

Shares rose slightly in pre-market trading. The company’s stock was up more than 7% year to date, as of Tuesday’s close.

TJX, which runs T.J. Maxx, Marshall’s and HomeGoods, has become the de facto leader in the off-price space for its ability to offer a wide range of premium, branded products and entice higher income shoppers who are looking for cheaper options in the face of persistent inflation. 

Over the last year, it raised its sales and profit guidance numerous times. Ahead of the holiday season, it struck a positive tone as other retailers issued cautious or disappointing guidance amid slowing demand and an uncertain economy.

During the holidays, consumers were laser-focused on finding the best deals and discounts, spending record amounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday and pulling back when promotions weren’t available. TJX was well-positioned during the period because consumers were able to shop for a wide range of gifts and at prices that tend to be lower than competitors. 

TJX’s offering has been better than usual because so many of its suppliers had high inventories throughout 2022 and 2023 and relied on the off-price retailer to help clear that gut. Now that inventories are leveling out across the industry, Wall Street will be keen to see the state of TJX’s offering and if it can sustain the growth and demand it posted over the last year. 

TJX’s guidance appears to reflect that concern. For the current quarter, it expects earnings per share of 84 cents to 86 cents, light of the higher end of Wall Street’s expectations of 82 cents to 93 cents, according to LSEG. For the full year, it expects earnings per share of $3.94 to $4.02, compared to estimates of $3.88 to $4.40.

In a research note from Jane Hali and Associates, store checks across New York, Florida, Texas and California showed “fewer notable brand names across luxury, affordable luxury and contemporary.” While inventory levels in the previous quarter were flat, some stores looked to have too much inventory and “too much clearance,” the note said.

1b25qra,stocks,Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Last-Ditch Bid to Avoid Expected Suit,"# Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Last-Ditch Bid to Avoid Expected Suit

(Bloomberg) -- **Apple Inc. representatives met with the Justice Department last week in a final bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the company**, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company and its lawyers met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will make the final call on whether to file a suit, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential meeting. Such “last rites” meetings are often one of the final steps before a lawsuit is filed.

Antitrust enforcers, who have been probing the company since 2019, allege that Apple has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing. The suit is expected in the coming weeks, likely by the end of March, the people said.

Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

Apple’s App Store, which charges developers a commission of either 15% or 30%, has come under heavy criticism by developers and lawmakers.

In January, Apple said it will allow US developers to use alternative payment systems, but charge a 27% fee for most digital purchases or 12% on subscriptions. Epic Games Inc., which sued the company over its App Store policies, is contesting the proposed changes, saying they are inadequate and would effectively prevent developers from reducing consumer prices.

In an interview with Bloomberg News this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state was in touch with the Justice Department about the potential case and could join onto an eventual complaint.

“We’re very interested in” possibly joining, Bonta said. “We are very aware of the federal government’s interest in Apple. We are interested also, and it’s very aligned with our overall strategy in the tech industry.”

The Justice Department has also been monitoring Apple’s moves in Europe as it prepares to begin enforcing new digital gatekeeper rules on March 7.

To comply with those rules, Apple said it will allow customers to download software from outside its App Store, use alternative payment systems and more easily choose a new default web browser. Yet several developer groups have slammed Apple’s proposed changes as “malicious compliance” with the EU’s rules, criticizing the iPhone maker for introducing new fees for payment processing and a €0.50 per app installation fee for software downloaded more than 1 million times. While Apple said most developers in the EU would see their payments decrease or stay the same, developers say the new fee will force them to stay within the App Store or face prohibitive payments.

Apple is expected to face a fine of at least €500 million ($542 million) by EU’s antitrust watchdog as soon as next week related to allegations it silenced music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology SA, on its platforms. The company separately offered to settle a second probe into its tap-to-pay technologies, by opening up access to its coveted near-field communication chip on iPhones to rival digital wallets.

1b24v4l,stocks,Baidu revenue grows 6% in fourth quarter as AI and advertising boost business,"China’s Baidu said fourth-quarter revenue rose 6%, helped by gains from its artificial intelligence applications and a growing advertising business.

For the three months through December, the company reported revenue of 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion), broadly in line with analysts’ average estimate of 34.97 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s adjusted net income rose by 44% to 7.76 billion yuan, compared with 5.37 billion yuan for the same period a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts for 6.32 billion yuan.

As China’s largest internet search engine, Baidu makes the majority of its revenue from advertising. But as China’s economy slows and consumers spend less, Baidu has increasingly invested in AI. In March last year, it launched its ChatGPT-like ERNIE Bot in bid to capture from the potential of the technology.

The company said ERNIE AI services have already started to contribute to Baidu’s revenues.

“Throughout 2023, we made significant strides in advancing ERNIE and ERNIE Bot, reinventing our products and services, and achieving breakthroughs in monetization.” Co-founder and CEO Robin Li said in a statement.

The U.S.-listed shares of the company rose by 0.4% in trading before the bell.

Baidu’s online marketing revenue grew 6% to 19.2 billion yuan.

For the quarter, its adjusted profit was 21.86 yuan per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with a profit of 15.25 yuan per share a year earlier.

This exceeded analysts’ average estimate of 17.87 yuan per ADS, according to LSEG.

1b24tan,stocks,Reddit's IPO - The most important details & red flags,"It has been a while since there was an exciting IPO, but finally, there is one. 

I went through the Reddit prospectus, and here's my summary of Reddit as a company, the IPO, and some of the red flags I saw.

&#x200B;

The post will be divided into the following segments:

**- Current business model**

\- **Future business model**

\- **Analysis of financial statements**

\- **Why IPO?**

**- The IPO strategy**

**- Sam Altman**

**- Valuation**

&#x200B;

**Current business model**

Reddit's primary revenue source is - advertising. In 2023, it accounted for 98% of the $804 million in revenue. The remaining 2% comes from Reddit premium subscriptions, as well as products within the user economy (Reddit Gold / Avatars).

Given the significance of the advertising revenue stream, let's focus on that. The simple formula that can be derived is: **Number of users** multiplied by **Average revenue per user**. 

These are the two most important numbers that any investor needs to focus on when analyzing almost any advertising business.

Let's start with the number of users. In an ideal world, we should know the exact number of users, and divide that with the potential user size. This will allow us to calculate the so-called ""penetration rate"". So, if the penetration rate is 10% for example, it indicates that the company has plenty of room to grow.

Reddit discloses two metrics: DAUq (Daily active uniques) and WAUq (Weekly active uniques). This could be seen as the first red flag. Here's why:

If we define the market size as users who are above the age of 14, that's over 270 million in the U.S.

The U.S. daily active uniques are 36 million. Hence, if we use these metrics, the penetration rate is about **13%**.

However, if we use the weekly active uniques, we get to a penetration rate of almost **50%** (131 million WAUq).

So, which one is it?

I'll argue that even the 50% is understated. Why? Because first of all, not everyone will be on Reddit, just as not everyone will be on any other platform. Second of all, there are users who use Reddit once every few months, when they need someone's advice or opinion. These, once in a while users are not taken into these metrics.

In theory, the company can innovate, and bring new features, that attract more users, and the average time spent per user increases. Given that the platform doesn't change too much over time, I'll argue that the platform applies only to a certain type of user and is getting close to the ceiling when it comes to growing within the U.S.

Internationally, on the other side, there is plenty of room to grow. However, as George Orwell said, ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"".

This brings us to the 2nd part of the equation - average revenue per user.

The average U.S. user brings 4x more revenue than the average user from the rest of the world. So, although there is room to grow, it is less valuable.

&#x200B;

**Future business model**

This is a good short summary of Reddit's main income stream, but it is backward-looking, and there is one more thing that we need to take into account. Its data.

It is fair to say that the platform is one of the internet's largest archives of human experiences and conversations, and this data definitely has value. It can be used for various reasons, including, training large language models. Pretty much the same day as filing the prospectus, Reddit and Google announced a partnership, that is expected to be worth $60 million per year. This is 8% of its 2023 revenue and I believe this revenue stream - licensing data - is what will create all the hype around the company. 

Here's why I think that:

&#x200B;

**Analysis of financial statements**

Despite being around for 19 years, Reddit is still struggling to find its way to profitability and loses around $100m per year. It can be argued that the company is poorly managed, and it reminds me of Twitter prior to the acquisition of Elon Musk, when the R&D was incredibly high and couldn't be justified with the new features introduced by the platform.

Reddit's R&D for 2023 was $438 million (55% of revenue). Of course, this is lagging, as in many cases, the value created from it is somewhere in the future. However, this isn't something new. Reddit has historically had high R&D expenses. Whether this is justified or not, of course, you be the judge.

Its revenue growth in 2023 was 20%, which isn't too exciting and can be barely labeled as a growth company. Especially considering there's not much room to grow in the U.S. and its international growth is less valuable.

&#x200B;

The expectation is that the valuation will be above $5 billion. The company has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt apart from leases. Meaning, that the valuation of the business is above $3.8 billion. 

I'd argue with the current business model and lack of profitability, this cannot be justified. Its future value is highly dependent on the success of data licensing, a revenue stream, that we have very little information on.

&#x200B;

**Why IPO?**

However, the question ""Why IPO?"" has not been answered yet. The company is losing $100m per year and has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is sufficient to cover the losses for the foreseeable future. So, raising additional funds doesn't seem to be the main reason for the IPO.

Two reasons should be considered:

1. **Liquidity for the existing shareholders** \-  However, if the existing shareholders are pushing for this, it means they're not too optimistic about the company's future.
2. Executive compensation - The CEO, for example, has over 660k PRSUs (Performance-restricted share units) that are eligible to vest when the company attains a $5b market cap valuation.

In my opinion, if the current shareholders believe in the company, they would be better off if the company remained private. So far, I am not convinced that the IPO adds any value to the company.

Being a public company brings quite some costs. The list of all costs, that is disclosed in the prospectus is yet to be completed, and there are also going to be additional ongoing expenses for being a public company, that will be incurred every single year.

&#x200B;

**The IPO strategy**

The price of pretty much anything is a function of supply and demand. As Reddit doesn't need additional funds, I don't expect the company will issue too many additional shares. Rumors range from raising $100m to $750m. Now, if we focus on the demand, here's another red flag.

Qualified Reddit users and moderators will be invited to buy shares in the IPO, alongside other investors, through a directed share program. In my opinion, this is a psychological trick, making the users and moderators feel special so that they use this special offer to buy shares.

In addition, there will be shares offered through Fidelity Brokerage Services, SoFi, and Robinhood. So, if someone wants to buy into an IPO, they get a chance to do that. Basically, the goal is to increase demand as much as possible.

&#x200B;

**Sam Altman**

Entities affiliated with Sam Altman have 9.2% voting power. Yes, the  OpenAI Sam Altman.

Have you seen the licensing deal between OpenAI and Reddit?  
Me neither.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Anyway, one of the questions that many have is - Is Reddit going to be overvalued from the start? The answer to that question depends on your expectations for the data licensing model. Based on my estimates, the current advertising business model is worth around $1.7 billion.

Add the $1.2 billion of cash on top of it, and the valuation is close to $3 billion.

Of course, I could be wrong in my estimates, but it is quite clear that the advertising business doesn't explain the $5 billion + valuation.

So, is the data licensing revenue stream worth more than $2 billion? This is one of the main questions that needs to be answered. As there is no past information, it is also the key piece of the puzzle to create hype around the company. I would not be surprised if more data licensing information followed before the IPO, which further increases the hype around the company.

However, if Reddit can land many data licensing deals, then the $5 billion valuation can be justified.

&#x200B;

I'd love to read your thoughts about the IPO, your thoughts on how much the data licensing stream is worth, as well as if there is something else that you find important, that I missed.",2024-02-28 12:23:13,2024-02-29 15:29:42.624973,1 days 03:06:29.624974,165,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24tan/reddits_ipo_the_most_important_details_red_flags/

**7% interest rates hit weekly mortgage demand hard**

KEY POINTS

* The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.04% from 7.06%
* Applications to refinance a home loan were 7% lower than the previous week and were 1% lower than the same week one year ago.
* Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% lower than the same week one year ago.

*Higher mortgage rates continue to hit demand from both current homeowners and potential homebuyers.*

*Total mortgage application volume dropped 5.6% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made to account for the Presidents Day holiday.*

*The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.04% from 7.06%, with points increasing to 0.67 from 0.66 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. The rate was about a quarter percentage point higher than it was one year ago.*

*As a result, applications to refinance a home loan were 7% lower than the previous week and were 1% lower than the same week one year ago.*

*“Higher rates in recent weeks have stalled activity, and last week it dropped more for those seeking FHA and VA refinances,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist, in a release.*

*FHA and VA loans are generally used by lower-income borrowers because they have lower down payment requirements.*

*Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% lower than the same week one year ago.*

*Fratantoni noted, however, that mortgage demand from buyers looking at newly built homes jumped 19% year over year in January.*

*“This disparity continues to highlight how the lack of existing inventory is the primary constraint to increases in purchase volume. However, mortgage rates above 7% sure don’t help,” he added. Rates were in the 6% range for all of January.*

*Mortgage rates moved higher again to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The 30-year fixed is now matching the highest level since early December 2023.*

*“There were no interesting or obvious catalysts for the move, nor would we expect there to be when it comes to the level of volatility seen on almost any day of the past 2 weeks,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.*",2024-02-28 12:14:55,2024-02-29 15:29:42.624977,1 days 03:14:47.624977,31,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24nx8/inflation_remain_flat_ahead/

1b1v1eg,stocks,Disney goes on the offensive in proxy battle with activist Nelson Peltz a month before shareholder meeting (Disney stock closed up 1.6%),"*Feb 27 (Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N), opens new tab appealed directly to shareholders in its battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz, publishing a point-by-point refutation of claims made by the head of Trian Fund Management on the company's Vote Disney website on Tuesday.*

*Disney cited nine examples where it disputed claims made by Peltz, who is attempting to gain two board seats, one for himself and another for ally and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo.*

*Disney, Peltz and another activist investor, Blackwells Capital, have roughly one month to persuade investors to back their board room directors. Each party is making its case in hopes of persuading shareholders ranging from institutions to mom and pop investors.*

*The company attacked a broad range of Peltz's arguments that ranged from the billionaire investor's track record to the financial acumen of its former CFO and Peltz ally:*

\**Among the 11 companies on which Peltz or other Trian representative held a board seat, which were cited by Peltz as having benefited from his involvement, about 68% of the cases have underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index, Disney said.*

\**Despite Trian's claims in February that it and other investors were ""caught in the Disney mousetrap,"" Disney cited a report claiming Peltz realized a $150 million profit from the sale of about one-third of his stake in the company in early 2023.*

\**Disney also rejected Trian's claims that its board would benefit from Rasulo's media and business acumen. Since joining the iHeartMedia Board as lead independent director in May 2019 the media company's stock has declined 87%, the company noted.*

*\*The company defended the performance of its global streaming services, and disputed claims that Disney had refused to engage with Peltz, noting there have been no fewer than 20 ""meaningful interactions.""*

*Disney's battle with activist investors comes at a pivotal time for Disney, as the company is trying to reinvigorate its creative franchises, make its streaming business profitable and find partners to help build ESPN's digital future. Chief Executive Bob Iger has called the activist campaigns a ""distraction.""*

*Hedge fund Blackwells Capital also has solicited investor support for its three nominees to Walt Disney's board, Craig Hatkoff, a co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival who also has a background in real estate, Jessica Schell, a former executive vice president of Warner Bros Home Entertainment, and Leah Solivan, founder and former CEO of TaskRabbit, an online marketplace for freelance labor.*

1b1pr1s,stocks,"Beyond Meat shares soar 80% as company tops quarterly revenue estimates, plans 'steep' cost cuts in 2024","Beyond Meat on Tuesday topped market expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on resilient demand for its faux meat patties in key markets outside the United States, and said it would ramp up its pricing actions in 2024.

The company’s shares, which fell 27.7% in 2023, jumped about 84% in extended trade on Tuesday as CEO Ethan Brown also said Beyond Meat would “steeply reduce” operating expense and cash use in the year.

About 40% of the company’s shares were short at the end of January, as per LSEG data.

To counter weak demand in the United States, Beyond Meat, which supplies its plant-based meat patties to fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Yum! Brands, has lowered prices and resorted to higher discounts.

Faux meat is pricier than traditional meat — a factor that has discouraged budget-conscious consumers in the U.S. from opting for the former in recent times.

The company has also been able to sustain demand for plant-based meat in its international markets, particularly Europe.

Cost-cut measures, including job cuts taken last year, have also helped reduce the burden on margins from sluggish demand in the United States.

Volumes rose 8% in the quarter ended Dec 31, compared to a 3.5% increase in the third quarter.

Net revenue for the fourth quarter fell 7.8% to $73.7 million, but topped analysts’ average estimate of $66.7 million, as per LSEG data.

Still, the company’s full-year net revenue forecast in the range of $315 million to $345 million was largely below market expectations of $343.8 million.

It reported a bigger-than-expected loss of 92 cents per share for the fourth quarter, compared with expectations of 88 cents.

* Company is winding down work on decade-old Project Titan
* Employees on some car teams will move to Apple’s AI division

&#x200B;

[(Bloomberg)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986) \-- **Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car**, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.

But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.

The decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.

Most recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.

1b1kg1z,stocks,"Streaming to Overtake Pay TV Subscription Revenue in the U.S. This Year: it will hit $17.3 billion, topping $16.7 billion from pay TV.","***Hollywood Reporter:*** 

*Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast.*  
  
*Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. “Streaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines – with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017,” it predicts.*

*Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but “streaming’s lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up,” Ampere explained.*  
*U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firm’s projections.*  
*The ad tiers that streamers have added, from Netflix and Amazon Prime to Disney+ and the streaming services of other Hollywood giants, are one driving force of revenue. Streaming advertising revenue will pass the $9 billion mark in the U.S. this year, the Ampere study forecasts. “The introduction of cheaper ad tiers has been successful not only in increasing new subscriber growth in previously saturated markets, but also in acting as an additional revenue source for streaming services,” the firm explained. Revenue will be further “bolstered” by Amazon Prime Video’s new advertising tier launched this quarter, it highlighted.*

*“Most major streaming services in the U.S. have launched their hybrid advertising tiers, which, along with increasing clampdowns on password sharing, have been successful at reigniting growth in the streaming market,” said Rory Gooderick, senior analyst at Ampere.*  
  
*Goodrick added, “There is still a way forward for pay TV, however. Disney and Charter’s recent deal in the U.S., which gave almost 15 million Charter subscribers access to Disney+’s advertising tier, shows how the two businesses can work together to maximize streaming’s reach to domestic subscribers and highlights the importance of traditional distribution platforms as service aggregators. Longer-term contracts and the reduction in churn make this an attractive proposition for streamers, while control over the billing relationship also means there’s something in it for the pay-TV provider.”*

1b1jw61,stocks,Are stocks facing a decade of stagnation? (Analysis from The Economist),"The Economist is [painting a pretty grim picture](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/25/stockmarkets-are-booming-but-the-good-times-are-unlikely-to-last) for the future of the stock market. Please discuss.

&#x200B;

>Everywhere you look, stockmarkets are breaking records. American equities, as measured by the s&p 500 index, hit their first all-time high in more than two years in January, surged above 5,000 points in February and roared well above that level on February 22nd when Nvidia, a maker of hardware essential for artificial intelligence (ai), released spectacular results. The same day, Europe’s stoxx 600 set its own record. Even before Nvidia’s results had been announced, Japan’s Nikkei 225 had surpassed its previous best, set in 1989. Little surprise, then, that a widely watched global stockmarket index recently hit an all-time high, too (see chart 1).  
This is quite a turnaround. Stocks slumped in 2022, when faced with fast-rising interest rates, and wobbled last March, during a banking panic. Now, though, both episodes look like brief interruptions in equities’ long march higher. Despite middling economic growth and the covid-19 pandemic, stockmarkets have offered annual returns, after inflation, of more than 8% a year since 2010, including dividends (cash payments to shareholders, funded by company profits) and capital gains (when the price of a share increases). These returns have been better than those produced by bonds and housing. Indeed, they have been better than those produced by just about any other asset class.  
If the boom has a home, it is America. A hundred dollars invested in the s&p 500 on January 1st 2010 is now worth $600 (or $430 at 2010’s prices). However you measure them, American returns have outclassed those elsewhere. Almost 60% of Americans now report owning stocks, the most since reliable data began to be collected in the late 1980s. Many of them, as well as many professional investors, have a question. Is the stockmarket surge sustainable or the prelude to a correction?  
For as long as stockmarkets have existed there have been those predicting an imminent crash. But today, in addition to the usual doomsaying, a chorus of academics and market researchers argues that it will be tough for American firms to deliver what is required over the long-term to reproduce the extraordinary stockmarket returns seen in recent years. Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve has written about the “end of an era”, and warned of “significantly lower profit growth and stock returns in the future”. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has suggested that the “tailwinds of the last 30 years are unlikely to provide much boost in the coming years”. Jordan Brooks of aqr Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund, has concluded that “a repeat of the past decade’s equity market performance would require a heroic set of assumptions.”  
That is, in part, because valuations are already at eye-popping levels. The most closely followed measure of them was devised by Robert Shiller of Yale University. It compares prices with inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous decade—a long enough period to smooth out the economic cycle. The resulting cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or cape, has never been higher than 44.2, a record reached in 1999, during the dotcom bubble. The previous peak was in 1929, when the cape hit 31.5. It now stands at 34.3 (see chart 2).  
Rarely have corporate profits been valued so highly. And the outlook for the profits themselves is also challenging. To understand why, consider the fundamental sources of their recent growth. We have employed Mr Smolyansky’s methodology to examine national-accounts data for American corporations. Between 1962 and 1989 net profits increased in real terms by 2% a year. After that, profits accelerated. Between 1989 and 2019 they increased by more than 4% a year. We find similar trends across the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries. As a share of gdp, corporate profits were steady from the 1970s to the 1990s, then doubled (see chart 3).  
Market of mirrors  
Yet much of this strong performance is, in a sense, a mirage. Politicians have reduced the tax burden facing corporations: from 1989 to 2019 the effective corporation-tax rate on American firms dropped by three-fifths. Since companies were giving less money to the state, corporate profits rose, leaving them with more money to pass on to shareholders. Meanwhile, over the same period borrowing became cheaper. From 1989 to 2019 the average interest rate facing American corporations fell by two-thirds.  
Mirroring Mr Smolyansky, we find that in America the difference in profit growth during the 1962-1989 period and the 1989-2019 period is “entirely due to the decline in interest and corporate-tax rates”. Extending this analysis to the rich world as a whole, we find similar trends. The surge in net profits is really an artefact of lower taxes and interest bills. Measures of underlying profits have grown less impressively.  
Now companies face a serious problem. The decades-long slide in interest rates has reversed. Risk-free interest rates across the rich world are about twice as high as they were in 2019. There is no guarantee that they will fall back to these lows—let alone decline fairly steadily, as they tended to in the decades before the pandemic.  
As for taxes, the political winds have changed. True, Donald Trump may see fit to cut America’s corporation-tax rate if he wins in November. But our analysis of 142 countries finds that in 2022 and 2023 the median statutory corporate-tax rate rose for the first time in decades. For instance, in 2023 Britain increased its main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Governments have also established a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15% on large multinational enterprises. Once it has bedded in, such companies will probably pay between 6.5% and 8.1% more tax, leaving a smaller pool of net profits.  
What needs to happen, then, for American stocks to keep offering exceptional returns? One possibility is that investors pay for even more stretched valuations. In a world in which interest and tax bills remain constant for the next decade while real earnings grow at 6% a year—an optimistic scenario—America’s cape would need to rise to 51 to reproduce the overall returns seen from 2013 to 2023. That would be higher than it has ever gone before.  
Now make things grimmer and assume that valuations revert towards their means. The cape drifts towards 27, near the average since the end of the dotcom bubble. Assume, too, that interest and tax bills rise. Rather than clocking in at 25% of earnings, they drift up to 35%, or around the level in the first half of the 2010s. In this more realistic world, to generate even half the returns equity investors enjoyed since 2010, real earnings would have to grow at 9% per year. Only twice in the post-war period has America achieved this sort of growth, according to Mr Brooks, and in both cases the economy was rebounding from busts—once from the dotcom bubble and once from the global financial crisis of 2007-09.  
Many investors hope that ai will ride to the rescue. Surveys of chief executives suggest great enthusiasm for tools that rely on the technology. Some companies are already adopting them, and claim that they are producing transformative productivity gains. If deployed more widely, the tools may allow companies to cut costs and produce more value, juicing economic growth and corporate profits.  
Play the fool  
Needless to say, this is a heavy burden for a technology that is still nascent. Moreover, technological developments are far from the only trend that will affect business in the coming years. Firms face an uncertain geopolitical climate, with global trade flat or declining depending on the measure. In America both parties are sceptical of big business. The battle against inflation is also not yet won: interest rates may not fall as far or as fast as investors expect. In recent decades you would have been foolish to bet against stockmarkets, and timing a downturn is almost impossible. But the corporate world is about to face an almighty test.

1b1i87o,stocks,Reddit Files S1 for IPO,"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…

  
\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

  
\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

  
\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”

  
\- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe).

1b1i5rt,stocks,Norwegian Cruise Line reports first profitable year since 2019,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings on Tuesday reported its first profitable year since 2019 as fourth-quarter losses narrowed dramatically.

The cruise company reported strong growth and ticket demand with an encouraging 2024 forecast. Shares of the company surged 17% following the report.

Here’s how Norwegian performed in the fourth quarter compared with estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 18 cents vs. 14 cents expected

Revenue: $1.99 billion vs. $1.97 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Norwegian reported a net loss of $106.5 million, an improvement from a loss of $482.5 million in the year-ago period. The company’s loss per share narrowed to 25 cents from $1.14 the prior year. Adjusting for one-time items, Norwegian reported a loss per share of 18 cents.

For the full year, the company generated total revenue of $8.55 billion, a 32% increase from 2019, with a net income of $166.2 million. In 2022, Norwegian lost $2.27 billion.

The company saw 102.9% occupancy for the year. Total revenue per passenger per day increased 17% from pre-pandemic levels.

The company said it received robust demand for most of its cruises except those traveling through the Middle East, which were canceled due to the violence in Gaza. The cancellations only caused a slight dip in occupancy in the fourth quarter to 99.2%, the company said.

“Norwegian Cruise Line Holding experienced a momentous year of growth and achievement in 2023,” CEO Harry Sommer said in a statement. “We successfully took delivery of three new ships, one for each of our brands, representing the most deliveries in a single year in our Company’s 57-year history. This important milestone showcases our dedication to innovation and commitment to providing exceptional vacation experiences for our guests.”

The company said it’s currently at record-high booking levels due to “healthy consumer demand” across the fourth quarter and full year.

For the full year 2024, the company expects an adjusted profit of about $635 million, or $1.23 per share, and an occupancy rate of about 105%. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated 2024 earnings per share of $1.21.

Shares of other cruise companies, including Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corp., also rose Tuesday morning.

1b1gq35,stocks,Cava stock pops after blunder leads to early earnings release,"Cava’s stock rose 7% on Tuesday morning after the Mediterranean restaurant chain released its earnings report a day early.

Investors were expecting Cava to announce its earnings after the bell on Tuesday afternoon, but the company issued its press release Monday evening instead after early versions of the results appeared in news reports shortly after the market close.

Cava reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.05 million, or 2 cents per share, swinging from a net loss of $18.85 million, or $13.72 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, were expecting the company to break even for the quarter.

The chain’s revenue soared 36% to $177.1 million, topping analysts’ expectations of $174 million. Cava’s same-store sales climbed 11.4%, crushing expectations of 5.9% growth, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For 2024, Cava is planning to open between 48 and 52 new locations. The company is forecasting same-store sales growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $86 million to $92 million.

Cava’s shares have soared 145% since its initial public offering in June. Including Tuesday’s stock move, the restaurant chain has a market value of $6.14 billion.

1b1goet,stocks,"Warner Bros. Discovery halts merger talks with Paramount Global, sources say ","Warner Bros. Discovery has gone “pencils down” on a potential acquisition of Paramount Global, halting talks after several months of kicking the tires on merging the media companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

Skydance Media, the film and TV studio run by David Ellison, is still performing due diligence on a potential transaction, two of the people said.

Paramount Global has set up a special committee, which has hired its own financial adviser, to sift through potential bids for the whole company or certain assets. Media mogul Byron Allen offered $14 billion for the company last month, though he has a history of bidding on and not buying large media assets.

Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, isn’t interested in acquiring Paramount Global assets, one of the people said. Comcast has been working with house bankers to explore a potential commercial partnership with Paramount Global, according to people familiar with the matter.

That could include bundling or merging streaming services Peacock and Paramount+, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, or a different arrangement. Still, it’s unclear if Paramount Global would have interest in this as it explores sale scenarios.

Spokespeople for Comcast, Paramount Global, Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.

Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav had a preliminary conversation with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, CNBC reported in December. The companies engaged in more serious merger discussions in January, but talks have cooled off this month.

Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell 10% Friday after the company missed analyst targets for earnings and revenue. Shares have fallen 47% in the past year and are near a 52-week low.

Paramount Global is also trading close to a 52-week low as it prepares to announce its earnings Wednesday.

1b1g2q3,stocks,Chip stock bubble ,"
I keep hearing about the chip stock AI induced bubble.

Stock prices and market cap of these stocks have shot up quickly to the stratosphere, so I understand the bubble concern. 

However, the valuation stocks like NVIDIA really doesn't seem outrageous based on earnings and predicted future earnings and the speed in which earnings are growing. 

Question:

I Google'd ""AAPL stock"" to see how it was doing, and the first news link was from ""The Motley Fool"" titled *""Warren Buffett Sells Apple Shares. Should You Follow His Lead?""* ([link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/02/26/warren-buffett-sells-apple-shares-should-you-follo/)). As an investor in the AAPL stock, I was a bit concerned and wanted to check the article out.

The article mentions that ""Berkshire Hathaway sold some AAPL shares"". This made me actually go look at the form 13F to see what ""some"" means.

1b1euc1,stocks,Thoughts on CPRI,"Back in August 2023, CPRI and TPR announced TPR’s takeover of CPRI for $57/share. The stock price initially jumped up to ~$54/share and has been in slow decline since then. It currently sits around ~$46. Part of this fall is due to the FTC’s second request for information for HSR purposes. 

Given that most expect this deal to close this year and, if it does, the current price provides for a potential ~25% upside, it seems the risk is worth the reward. 

It’s hard to imagine the FTC blocking this deal given that (1) the combined company would have roughly ~5% of the market, (2) the luxury handbag market is not one that requires strict consumer protection, and (3) the FTC seems to have its sights more focused on breaking up big tech, blocking any big oil mergers, and halting any large grocery store chain combinations.

1b1ctk9,stocks,Macy’s posts another quarter of falling sales as it unveils strategy to get back to growth,"Macy’s on Tuesday said sales fell nearly 2% in the holiday quarter, as the 166-year-old department store operator unveiled its strategy to get back to growth. 

Here’s what Macy’s reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.45 adjusted vs. $1.96 expected
Revenue: $8.12 billion vs. $8.15 billion expected
The retailer said it expects sales to remain stagnant. It projected net sales of between $22.2 billion to $22.9 billion for this fiscal year, down from $23.09 billion in 2023. It anticipates comparable sales, which take out the impact of store openings and closures, will range from a decline of about 1.5% to a gain of 1.5% compared with the year-ago period on an owned-plus-licensed basis and including third-party marketplace sales.

Yet the company’s new CEO Tony Spring laid out a brighter outlook for the following fiscal year and how Macy’s plans to get there. Spring is the former CEO of Macy’s higher-end department store Bloomingdale’s. He took the helm earlier this month, weeks after Macy’s announced layoffs and as it faced pressure from activist investors.

In an interview with CNBC, he said the company is taking a clear-eyed look at its business — particularly its struggling namesake stores.

“Yes, there are headwinds, certainly on discretionary categories and the middle-income consumer, but we take responsibility for what we control,” he said. “Let’s put better products into our stores. Let’s make sure it’s merchandised appropriately at a decent value. And then we have more opportunity for conversion and more [market] share.”

As part of the retailer’s push to woo shoppers and restore investor confidence, Macy’s said it will make big changes to its store footprint. Macy’s plans to close about 150 unproductive locations and to prioritize investing in about 350 other namesake locations.

It plans to focus more on selling luxury goods by opening about 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and at least 30 new Bluemercury stores over the next three years. It will also remodel roughly 30 existing stores of the beauty chain during that time. 

Macy’s had already announced five store closures and more than 2,300 layoffs last month. It also said last year that it would open up to 30 smaller versions of its namesake stores in strip malls over the next two years.

In a news release on Tuesday, Macy’s said it will also take a hard look at how to operate more efficiently – such as scrutinizing the network of warehouses used for its e-commerce business.

In the fiscal year that starts in early 2025, Macy’s said it expects low-single digit comparable sales growth on an annual basis, including owned, licensed and marketplace sales. It said it expects capital spending to fall below 2024 levels and free cash flow to drop to pre-pandemic levels. Its outlook does not include any potential impact from a proposed credit card late fee ruling by the federal government. 

Macy’s, which includes its namesake banner, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, has faced scrutiny from activist investors Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who made a rejected bid to buy the retailer. Arkhouse recently nominated a slate of nine directors to Macy’s board.

For the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 4, Macy’s swung to a loss of $71 billion, or 26 cents per share, from net income of $508 million, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. The losses included $1 billion of impairment and restructuring costs related to Macy’s plans to close about 150 locations, which are part of its turnaround strategy.

Revenue fell from $8.26 billion in the year-ago period. Digital sales declined 4% compared to the prior-year quarter and brick-and-mortar sales were roughly flat.

Across the company, comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis fell 4.2% from the year-ago period. That was better than the 5.8% decline that analysts expected, according to LSEG.

Macy’s continued to be the weakest store banner – a trend reflected in the company’s plans to close many of its stores. The namesake store’s comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis dropped by 4.7%, as the women’s shoes and cold weather apparel and accessories categories struggled. Beauty and Macy’s off-price business, Backstage, were stronger performers in the quarter. 

Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, the two store chains that the parent company plans to expand, both fared better in the holiday quarter. 

At Bloomingdale’s, comparable sales declined 1.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, as the men’s and designer handbag businesses came in soft.

Bluemercury’s comparable sales rose 2.3%, as shoppers bought skincare items and color cosmetics. 

Net credit card revenue also took a hit, as Macy’s said it tumbled by 26% from the prior year to $195 million as the company dealt with higher net credit card losses. 

So far this year, shares of Macy’s have fallen about 4%. The company’s stock has underperformed the approximately 6% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. Shares of Macy’s closed Monday at $19.30, bringing the company’s market value to $5.29 billion.

1b1crxj,stocks,"Lowe's beats earnings estimates as sales fall, company expects 2024 revenue to fall","Lowe’s on Tuesday beat Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, even as the company continued to see customers tackle fewer home projects.

The home improvement chain was going up against lower expectations for its fourth quarter. It had cut its full-year forecast in November, after CEO Marvin Ellison said the company had felt a “greater-than-expected pullback” on pricier items and discretionary home projects.

Lowe’s said it factored economic uncertainty into its forecast for the current fiscal year, too. It said it expects total sales of between $84 billion and $85 billion, which would be a drop from $86.38 billion in fiscal 2023. It anticipates comparable sales will decline between 2% and 3% compared with the prior year, and expects earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30.

Here’s what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.77 vs. $1.68 expected

Revenue: $18.60 billion vs. $18.45 billion expected

The company’s net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 2 was $1.02 billion, or $1.77 per share, compared with $957 million, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the costs associated with Lowe’s sale of its Canadian retail business, earnings per share were $2.28.

Sales fell from $22.45 billion in the year-ago period. The company said its prior-year quarter included an additional week and sales from its Canadian business.

Comparable sales dropped by 6.2% year over year, as the home improvement retailer saw weaker demand for do-it-yourself projects and poor weather in January. Comparable sales for home professionals, a category that includes plumbers, electricians and contractors, were flat year over year in the quarter, however.

During the fourth quarter, Lowe’s spent $404 million on share buybacks and paid $633 million in dividends.

As of Monday’s close, Lowe’s shares were up nearly 4% this year. That trails the approximately 6% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. Shares of Lowe’s closed at $231.32 on Monday, bringing the company’s market value to about $133 billion.

Rival Home Depot last week beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations, but its sales fell year over year and the retailer’s leaders described the past year as one of “moderation” after unusually high demand during the pandemic. The company also said customers were continuing to put off bigger projects because of higher interest rates.

“After careful consideration and many leadership discussions over several months, it has become clear changes need to be made to continue to grow the business and develop the company,” the unit’s President and CEO Jim Ryan said in an email to employees, released publicly by the company.

He added that employees across all of the company’s regions will be impacted by the layoffs. PlayStation’s London studio will close in its entirety, with several other studios due to be affected.

The Japanese gaming giant cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Feb. 14, after it warned of lower demand. Sony at the time said that it expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending on March, trimmed from a previous forecast near 25 million consoles.

The company’s shares plunged sharply after the forecast cut announcement.

Analysts had anticipated that Sony could move to release a refreshed version of the PlayStation 5 this year, seeking to boost interest in the console.

1b186uq,stocks,How do you fight the “I should have”?,"I’m still a newbie in investing, only been doing it for 4 years, and in the beginning it was a mess, frequently replacing my stocks because of rumors, or sold everything on “crash is coming” news. Now I’m much more calm, I survived -30% (solar) without quitting, and now up 25%.
Even though I’m much more rational, “I should have bought more NVDA” always comes back.
For 5 years I’ve been working with AI/ML in depth, with bare models, and even then (when ChatGPT was nowhere, and AI was a gimmick) I knew this is capable of anything. But I didn’t invest enough in it being a newbie, and listen to analysts who probably knew nothing about how AI is working and the potential in it (at least learnt that analysts opinions are just worthless).
Now 14% of my portfolio is NVDA (definitely the main driver of my portfolio), but I still feel like I will regret it not having more in it.
I know 14% is already not “diversified enough”, but it’s more rational than listening to my guts (would raise that 14% to 30% at least).
I know that this “should have” can go either way though.
When I had 40% of my portfolio in solar, for almost 2 years going down every single week was very hard to swallow, and then I said “I should have” bought less.
Every time I have this, I realise the only thing that can really help is diversifying, but it’s hard to silence gut feelings, and be completely rational.

1b118hg,stocks,Zoom shares jump as quarterly results beat on top and bottom lines,"Zoom shares rose as much as 13% in extended trading on Monday after the video chat software vendor announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations.

Here’s how the company did, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 adjusted vs. $1.15 expected

Revenue: $1.15 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected

Revenue increased less than 3% from $1.12 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $298.8 million, or 98 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Jan. 31, compared with a net loss of $104.1 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Far from its heyday during the Covid-19 pandemic, when a surge in the number of remote workers sent revenue up over 100% for five straight quarters, Zoom is now mired in single-digit growth.

Growth would have been faster in the fiscal fourth quarter if not for a sales reorganization. It “took a lot of time for the organization to recover from, frankly,” Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts.

At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom had 220,400 enterprise customers, up from 219,700 at the end of the prior quarter.

Zoom’s Team Chat migration tool “has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months,” Eric Yuan, the company’s founder and CEO, said during the call. He said Zoom hasn’t done a great job of marketing its chat capabilities.

For the fiscal first quarter, Zoom called for $1.18 to $1.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.125 billion in revenue, which would represent growth of less than 2% from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $1.13 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.13 billion in revenue.

For the 2025 fiscal year, Zoom sees $4.85 to $4.88 in adjusted earnings per share, with $4.60 billion in revenue, implying 1.6% revenue growth. The LSEG consensus was adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share and revenue of $4.65 billion.

Before the jump, Zoom shares were down 12% so far this year, while the S&P 500 stock index had gained 6% during the same period.

Charter is working with financial advisors as it considers whether it would make sense to buy Altice USA, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Altice hasn’t been approached by Charter to begin talks on a possible transaction, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The larger company’s shares dropped about 2% on Monday.

Charter declined to comment on the report, while Altice USA could not immediately be reached for comment.

The deal would bring significant consolidation at a time when major communications companies struggle to keep broadband and cable subscribers. Altice USA shares had plunged more than 40% this year before their jump Monday, while Charter’s stock has fallen about 25%.

Altice USA owns brands led by broadband, TV and phone company Optimum. The company has about five million customers.

Charter easily trumps its size with 32 million broadband and cable subscribers.

Unity said in January that it would cut 1,800 jobs as part of a corporate restructuring plan that included ending efforts deemed to be “non-strategic,” such as professional services and the Luna marketing business.

The company said first-quarter guidance for its strategic portfolio would come in between $415 million and $420 million. Analysts were expecting total first-quarter revenue of $534 million.

“We are right sizing our cost structure to grow from a healthy financial position,” Unity said in a shareholder letter. “This includes the previously announced reduction of approximately 25% of our workforce, in addition to cloud hosting cost savings, office footprint consolidation, and software license optimization.”

Unity said fourth-quarter revenue jumped 35% from $451 million a year earlier, while its net loss narrowed to $254 million from close to $288 million a year ago.

In October, John Riccitiello retired as Unity’s CEO and was replaced by former Red Hat chief James Whitehurst as interim CEO. Riccitiello’s departure came shortly after Unity announced a pricing change that upset several video game developers.

“We are committed to increasing shareholder value through revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow generation and we believe that the steps we have taken in the past few months position us for success in 2024 and beyond,” Unity said in its shareholder letter.

1b0n2q0,stocks,"FTC sues to block Kroger, Albertsons merger over price and wage concerns","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is suing to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, saying the combination of the two major grocers would result in higher prices for shoppers and lower wages for workers.

In a release, the FTC said it issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to stop Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, which would create one of the largest grocers in the country. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general have joined the court complaint, including those from Arizona, California, Washington D.C., Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming.

“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.”

Kroger said in a statement that blocking the deal “will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America’s consumers and workers.”

 “The FTC’s decision makes it more likely that America’s consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts,” the company said in a statement.

It added that the decision “strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry.”

Kroger and Albertsons’ agreement has been stuck in a holding pattern for more than a year while federal and state regulators scrutinize the merger. The companies announced the proposed deal in October 2022, and said by teaming up, the grocers would be able to better compete with larger retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco.

The FTC argued the supermarket merger would harm shoppers and workers at a time when the price of food and many everyday items has risen. The Biden administration has been skeptical of a range of mergers, and the White House has made consumer protection a key issue as President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection this fall.

Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen has made the company’s case for the tie-up, saying as a larger supermarket operator, the combined companies would be able to lower prices, boost profitability and speed up innovation in the grocery industry. The company also pledged $500 million to reduce prices for customers and $1 billion to raise employee wages and expand benefits.

Yet the deal has faced stiff resistance and new complications after a period of historic inflation. Two unions that represent Kroger and Albertsons employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters union, opposed the deal.

Higher prices of everyday food items fueled worries that a bigger company would have too much pricing power — concerns some politicians have echoed.

Higher grocery prices have irked consumers and become a hot topic on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, grocery chains drew the ire of Biden, who accused companies of ripping off shoppers while keeping profit margins high.

Together, Kroger and Albertsons would be a mammoth company and tighten a market share gap with Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S. Kroger and Albertsons also compete with regional players like Publix and Wegmans, and discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe’s.

Combined, the grocers would have about 5,000 stores across the U.S. The deal would marry Kroger’s approximately two dozen supermarket banners, including its namesake stores, Fred Meyer, and Ralphs with Albertsons’ grocery chains, including Safeway, Acme and Tom Thumb.

In an effort to overcome antitrust concerns, Kroger announced last year that it planned to sell more than 400 stores to Piggly Wiggly owner C&S Wholesale Grocers, along with other assets like distribution centers and some private brands.

But the FTC complaint said that the proposed divestiture isn’t enough. It would create “a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands and other assets” that wouldn’t be a true rival to the combined Kroger and Albertsons, the federal agency said in a release Monday.

The FTC contended the combined Kroger and Albertsons would have less reason to improve the customer experience. The federal agency said competition between the supermarkets has contributed to fresher produce, better private label offerings and services that shoppers appreciate, such as flexible pharmacy hours and curbside pickup.

The FTC also argued the deal would leave workers with less negotiating power, since employees wouldn’t have as many potential grocery employers. In some markets like Denver, the combined supermarket operator would be the only employer of unionized grocery workers, the agency said.

As some news outlets reported last week that the FTC would soon sue to block the merger, a Kroger spokeswoman said the company was still in discussions with FTC and state regulators.

The company reiterated its argument that the merger would benefit grocery shoppers and workers.

“Blocking the combination will only embolden large, non-unionized retailers – like Walmart, Amazon and Costco – to continue opposing unions and leaving communities,” the company said in a statement last week. “Kroger will continue to lower prices, grow good-paying union jobs and increase access to fresh food for the families who need it most.”

Kroger shares were trading about 1% lower Monday afternoon, while Albertsons stock was slightly higher.

I diversified a lot, and I want to continue to diversify even more.

At the moment, the only weakness my portfolio seems to have is that it is vulnerable to recessions. Now, obviously everyone is vulnerable to recessions. But apparently there's something called a hedge fund, and apparently they're called hedge funds because they're at least supposed to hedge against the market. 

When times are tough, say I get laid off etc, I don't want to have to sell my stocks at a loss to dip into them...even if it's not really a loss because I'm still way up. I want to sell at a profit no matter what, so, are hedge funds right for me?

But it seems all the most well-reputed hedgefunds have some serious capital requirements and fees. Frankly as a money-grubbing east coaster I have no desire for any fees nor do I have a gazillion dollars.

1b0lmjg,stocks,Elon Musk says Rivian needs to ‘cut costs massively’ and its execs should ‘live in the factory’ or the Tesla rival will die,"Elon Musk is not surprised by the bad news hitting Tesla rival Rivian. He’s been warning about it for some time.

On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%.

Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, “Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.”

“They need to cut costs massively and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,” he wrote.

Musk, having gone through “production hell” and “sleeping at the factory” himself at Tesla, should know.

The billionaire has warned about Rivian’s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be “to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they’re doomed.”

1b0gv1s,stocks,Cautious optimism about Frontier Developments,"The stock is now worth 125 GBX while their all time high was 3,300 GBX in 2021.

Up untill 2022 the company turned a small profit of 15-20 million GBP per year. However, last year the company had a 20 million loss. As explained by the company management themselves because of an unsuccesful attempt at expanding their portfolio with games like F1 Manager.

From what I’ve seen, that game was a buggy and boring mess and way outside Frontiers zone of competency. Frontier has recently stated they will return to focus on Creative Management Simulations with games like Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo, games which have brought them moderate success in the past.
Coming back to their financial performance; their attempts to broaden their portfolio over the past few years was the reason that their expenses doubled over the past few years but Frontier got little return on that investment. Exactly the reason why the company is in it's current state.

However, with games on the horizon like Planet Zoo for the console I don’t see why this company won’t return to profitability within the next few years? And if they are able to get back to a similar cashflow to the one they had before 2023 I feel like this stock would be way underpriced.

I’m curious about your guys thoughts and opinions on the Frontier stock?

1b0es64,stocks,How Japan’s Nikkei 225 Got Its Mojo Back,"  
Japan's two main indexes, i.e. Nikkei 225 and TOPIX, have outperformed S&P500 since January 2023.

Which market will reach its peak first?

  
\--------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
**How Japan’s Nikkei 225 Got Its Mojo Back**  
[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-japan-nikkei-225-records-historic-high](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-japan-nikkei-225-records-historic-high)

  
*Japanese stocks have reclaimed the historic peak reached over 34 years ago as global investors pour money into a country they’re betting has finally escaped deflation and is headed on a path of sustainable growth.*  
*On Thursday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 39,098.68, finally breaching the previous record. The leap was driven by gains in technology shares and chip-gear producers after Nvidia’s blowout sales forecast. The epic come-back — it took even longer than Wall Street’s recovery from the crash that sparked the Great Depression — marks a rebirth for Japan’s share market.*  
*Back then, the nation’s equities had risen so far and so fast that there really was only one way to go: down. “1989 was very likely the biggest bubble in human history,” said Nicholas Smith, strategist at CLSA Securities Japan Co.*  
*Today, despite some lingering concerns the rally may be a false dawn, most analysts and investors believe that the stock market is on much firmer ground. A more shareholder-friendly corporate culture has taken hold and steady gains in Japan look appealing to funds that have been burned by turmoil in markets like China.*  
  
*One of the key catalysts for the rebound is that signs of inflation — and the country’s anticipated exit from negative rates later this year — are encouraging companies to put their piles of cash to work on expanding and improving their business.*  
*Luminary investor Warren Buffett boosted his holdings in Japan’s biggest companies, an endorsement that’s further increased the allure of Tokyo stocks. Since the start of 2024, the Nikkei has surged over 16%, beating most other major markets. The outperformance is even more striking over the past 12-months or so.*  
  
*While there are still reasons to be cautious about the rebound — skeptics suggest that funds could rapidly flow back to China if sentiment shifts and worry that the Nikkei has become a momentum play — overseas investors have mostly put these aside.*  
*They are the driving force behind the rally, accounting for almost 70% of trading in the broader Topix Prime Index of stocks, while domestic buyers have largely sat on the sidelines. Institutional investors have pared their portfolios and individual Japanese investors are flocking to the US and other markets abroad following the expansion of special tax-free accounts in January.*  
*All the while, global buyers have absorbed the selling, with their holdings rising to 30%, from less than 5% in 1989.*  
*“It took a long time for global investors to accept that Japan had changed,” said Jonathan Garner, chief Asia strategist at Morgan Stanley, which was one of the first major brokerages to predict the market’s resurgence. Now, he said, after consistent corporate earnings growth and profitability improvements, there is greater agreement overseas that “Japan is in a secular bull market.*  
  
*In another sign of the great changes over the past three-plus decades, in 1989 Japanese companies accounted for 32 of the top 50 companies by global market capitalization. Today only one Japanese company, Toyota Motor Corp., makes the global top-50 list.*  
*Back in the late 1980s, Japanese banks were the true heavyweights in the market, thanks to inflated asset prices. The market is more balanced and diverse now, with major companies including Sony Group Corp., casual clothing chain operator Fast Retailing Co., the parent company of Uniqlo, and companies that hold key positions in the vast semiconductor supply chain, such as Tokyo Electron Ltd., which has benefited from a surge in orders from China.*  
  
*Even after this year’s rally, many Japanese stocks are still at depressed levels, with 37% of Nikkei members trading below their book value. In theory, this means investors could make more money by selling off all the company’s assets than keeping it as a going concern. This is tantamount to vote of no confidence in management, but it also suggests upside potential if the business is run right.*  
*Only 3% of stocks in the S&P 500 trade below book value. For the Euro Stoxx 600, just one-fifth fall under this category. The low valuations in Japan now are a stark contrast to 1989, when asset prices were at the other extreme.*  
*All this means that some fund managers now see the possibility of substantial gains to come for the Nikkei-225.*  
*“I think it could easily go to something like 42,000,” said Richard Kaye, portfolio manager at Comgest Asset Management. Getting back to the previous historic record will have “an enormous psychological impact on Japanese investors.”*",2024-02-26 10:56:33,2024-02-29 15:29:42.625138,3 days 04:33:09.625138,20,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0es64/how_japans_nikkei_225_got_its_mojo_back/

1azy1h0,stocks,Shorting Intuit (Turbo Tax),"I’m thinking of shorting intuit. 

With the recent mass layoffs of software engineers across the entire private sector industry, in combination with the fact that more people are enlightened by Turbo Tax’s shitty business practices every year (keeping taxes hard to do by lobbying), I really think the stock will crater in the next 3-5 years.

As for why the layoffs are relevant, SWEs are having trouble finding work in the private sector- and I imagine they will start turning to public sector jobs- the IRS being one of them.

1azuxn4,stocks,Disney & Reliance in India sign a binding agreement to merge their India businesses where Reliance owns 60% controlling stake.,"*(Reuters)*  
*Walt Disney and Reliance Industries have signed a binding agreement to merge their media operations in India, a Bloomberg report quoted people familiar with the matter. The report said Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries is expected to own a 61% stake in the merged entity as Disney reassesses its strategy in India amid intense competition. The representatives of Disney and Reliance declined to comment on the reports of the binding merger agreement.*  
*The distribution of shares among the partners could undergo alterations based on the inclusion of Disney's additional local assets at the time of finalizing the deal, the report said. Reliance Industries is also mulling over the acquisition of Tata Play Ltd., a broadcast service provider, in which Disney holds a minority stake.*

*At present, Tata Sons holds the ownership interest, constituting 50.2% of the stakes in Tata Play while the rest of the shares are held by Disney and Temasek, an investment firm based in Singapore.*

*Inception of a media behemoth:*  
*After the completion of the merger, Disney and Reliance would create a powerful and influential media giant in one of the globe's rapidly growing entertainment markets. As per the reports, Reliance is investing $1.5 billion for its 61% stake.*  
  
*The merger comes after some critical years for Disney as the fortunes of the US entertainment giant turned after Reliance became its direct competitor in the OTT space. The two giants fought hard for the sports right but in 2022, Mukesh Ambani's unit successfully outpaced Disney in securing streaming rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament.*

*In the same year, Reliance clinched a multi-year agreement to broadcast HBO shows from Warner Bros Discovery Inc., which were previously under Disney's purview. Under intense competition, Disney was forced to stream the ICC World Cup 2023 free for the users of its mobile application in India.*  
  
*Disney-Reliance merger is one of the two big-ticket transactions in the Indian media and entertainment space. Last month, the merger plans between Sony and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) ended on a bitter note due to disagreements regarding the leadership of the newly merged media powerhouse.*",2024-02-25 18:26:54,2024-02-29 15:29:42.625171,3 days 21:02:48.625172,2,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1azuxn4/disney_reliance_in_india_sign_a_binding_agreement/
1azlmvm,stocks,Thoughts on PLTR and SHOP? I don't see why they are so popular now,"I constantly hear about these two stocks for the past months. 

Analysts write articles everywhere! Popping on news feeds etc.

Given how they are discussed frequently online, I decided to take a look. Each company is taking advantage of the AI trend. PLTR using AI in their software for counter-terrorism investigations and SHOP using AI to further develop websites for individuals who wish to build an online store for marketing their product. 

Each company enjoyed a surge in 2021's pandemic / stock frenzy time but has since declined after stock correction in 2022. Both are now under pressure by investors' expectations from the AI trend's test of practicality. Seems clearcut and reasonable for the hype?

From a technical perspective, both stocks stink. A negative EPS with P/E Ratio of over 200 happening quite often. Recently, PTLR's EPS hits a positive of 0.09 and SHOP's EPS a 0.07, not impressive at the least. Their P/E Ratio is most telling with a 260 and 1011 respectively.

Yup, you are reading that correctly, a P/E ratio of over 1000... I haven't been investing for over 10 years but it is my first time seeing a 4 figure P/E ratio. 

TLDR: My conclusion? Confusion. I don't understand where the hype is and how it is justified based on the technicalities of both companies. Their finances stink and their AI potential seems more of a joining the bandwagon maneuver. 

Yet, they are so popular! PLTR has over a 50B market cap and SHOP has over 200B market cap, which put them in a large cap! What is going on?

So I did manually, based on trailing PE weighted by market cap.

The only apparent overvaluation looks in the electronic technology sector, but we all know the reason (AI/GPU wave).

Interesting enough, consumer durables overvaluation is due to TSLA alone.

1aywt2g,stocks,Charlie Munger – The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway,"Warren Buffett's tribute to his dear friend and investing Titan, Charlie Munger.  Bold is Buffett's own emphasis:

>Charlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100th birthday.

>Though born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life domiciled elsewhere. Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.

>In 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.

>Three years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in buying control of Berkshire. **But**, he assured me, since I had already made the move, he would tell me how to correct my mistake.

>In what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a dime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose money I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that Charlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.

>Nevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions.

>Many years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and, repeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he continued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with us, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.

>In reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, ad I acted as the “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.

>Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never – **never** –reminded me of my mistake.

>In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. 

>Though I have long been in charge of the construction
crew; **Charlie** should **forever** be credited with being the architect.",2024-02-24 15:12:55,2024-02-29 15:29:42.625220,5 days 00:16:47.625220,32,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aywt2g/charlie_munger_the_architect_of_berkshire_hathaway/

1aypzo4,stocks,Is the US Heading Towards a Soft Landing?,"One of the key debates around the health of the US economy is whether a soft landing is in sight. After avoiding a recession and with markets ending on a high note in 2023, the US Congressional Budget Office declared in December that “[b]y many measures, the economy looks like it is headed for a soft landing.”
Likewise, Goldman Sachs Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) is expecting a soft landing this year. However, recession risks remain above average. Here’s why.
Recession risk is lower compared to last year but uncertainty persists
ISG’s recession probability is 30% over the next 12 months, which is still somewhat elevated due to persistent uncertainty around still-inverted yield curves (a signal that the market as a whole is becoming more pessimistic about the economic prospects for the near future); the lagged impact of past monetary tightening; and potential pandemic distortions that may compromise previously reliable recession signals.
Despite the risks, ISG expects GDP to grow at a trend-like pace of 2.1% in 2024, supported by three factors:
A robust household sector (considering consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP)
Stable investment
Gradually easing financial conditions (a benchmark of forces that impact the economy)
Our ISG colleagues believe consumer consumption will grow at around 2% this year, likely to be driven by rising real incomes.
ISG sees an optimistic economic scenario for 2024, but is that enough for a soft landing? To answer that, it may be helpful to first understand when economists would truly call a recession.
When is a recession, truly a recession?
The typical textbook definition of a recession is when real GDP declines over two consecutive quarters. It is a method maintained by some economists, but the official process to call a true recession is more complicated and requires a holistic analysis of economic activity.
The National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official scorekeeper of recession. The Committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, and other indicators. A recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.”
The NBER Committee not only considers GDP data before deciding to call a recession, but they also analyze trends in economic activity including employment, income, sales, and industrial production.
Another widely cited indicator is the “Sahm rule”, named after economist Claudia Sahm. It states a recession is likely underway if the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by at least 0.5% – or 50 basis points – relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. As of January, the indicator stands at 0.2% — which improved versus the December reading — meaning there is no current indication of recession based on this metric.
Is US heading towards a soft landing?
Defining a “soft landing” isn’t straightforward either, but an economist at the St Louis Federal Reserve offered the following explanation: “A soft landing is when [the Fed] increase[s] interest rates and manage[s] to decrease inflation, but without causing unemployment to go up drastically and GDP growth to go negative.”
Conversely, a hard landing would occur if the Fed increased interest rates which led to a decrease in inflation but at the cost of a recession and high unemployment.
The Fed’s rate hike campaign to date has managed to lower the inflation rate. ISG expects inflation to continue its downward trend and average around 2.5% this year. ISG also anticipates four 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, but following the January FOMC commentary, they have pushed back their expectation for the first rate cut to May (from March previously).
Wages are currently growing at a rate above the Fed’s comfort level, but the labor market has made substantial progress towards rebalancing with job openings and quit rates approaching pre-pandemic levels, without a significant rise in the unemployment rate.
ISG expects these rebalancing dynamics to continue through 2024, predicting a modest increase in the unemployment rate from 3.7% to 4.1%.
Considering all factors, ISG sees a runway for a soft landing but cautions that seatbelts should remain fastened until we reach the gate.

*KEY POINTS*

* *Global markets have hit record highs as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment, but some investors have urged caution.*
* *Oliver Bäte, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks “very dangerous out there.”*
* *European markets moved higher Friday, extending positive momentum from Thursday’s session, when the Stoxx 600, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nikkei all notched record highs.*

&#x200B;

*Global markets hit record highs this week as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment and hopes of a return to economic growth. But some investors have urged caution, suggesting that high tech valuations could put the rally at risk.*

*Oliver Bäte, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks “very dangerous out there.”*

*“We are very cautious about some of the valuations in the tech sector,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Friday.*

*European markets extended gains Friday after the Stoxx 600 index closed at an all-time high in the previous session.*

*Fresh earnings out of Europe and spillover from Nvidia’s bumper revenue report in the U.S. helped push the pan-European benchmark to 495.1 on Thursday — surpassing its previous record of 494.35 in January 2022, according to data from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Germany’s DAX and the French CAC also hit record highs.*

*In Asia-Pacific, Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed at a new all-time high of 39,098.68 on Thursday, surpassing the previous record of 38,915.87 set in 1989.*

*The gains have been mirrored stateside, with U.S. stock indexes also scaling fresh all-time highs.*

*It comes amid ever-growing hype around AI innovation and the anticipated boost it could bring to the sluggish global economy.*

*Shares of Nvidia closed up 16% on Thursday after its full-year results showed revenue jumped 265% on the back of soaring demand for its AI chips. The surge boosted Nvidia’s market cap by $276 billion — the biggest one-day gain for any company on record.*

*Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told CNBC on Friday that the recent rallies pointed to AI “innovation in action on every front,” and said his company had benefited “enormously” from the tech. The comments came shortly after the bank posted an 18% increase in pretax profit and announced a $1 billion share buyback program in its full-year earnings Friday.*

*However, Philippe Ferreira, deputy head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, raised questions about how long the AI hype will continue to drive markets higher.*

*“Over the course of the year, it is likely that the overall AI theme will get a reality check at the companies’ level,” he said in notes to CNBC earlier this week. “The AI trade as we have seen it might have a little more to go, but it seems to be approaching important technical levels where some profit taking could occur.”*

*In the U.S. this week, investors piled into growth and technology stocks pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recorded its best session since February 2023, popping 2.96% to close at 16,041 on Thursday.*

*For Ferreira, “18,300 on NDX and early March could be key exit levels ahead of some material consolidation.”*

*“There is no shortage of fundamental catalysts and important reckonings could be up ahead,” he added.*

*For Allianz’ Bäte, there remain still-present pockets of risk in tech and beyond. “If I was individually investing \[in tech\], great idea. As an institutional investor, you need to be a bit careful,” he warned.*

*“There’s a lot of risk in investment markets, there’s a lot of questions about credit markets, there’s a lot of questions about real estate,” he said. “It’s very dangerous out there.”*

*On Japan’s headline-making rally, Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at investment advisory group Moneta, also expressed some concerns. She said the recent move higher appeared to have diverted attention away from market fundamentals.*

*“All of a sudden, it seems that shareholder value is returning to Japan, that the time has finally come,” Devitt told “Squawk Box Asia” on Friday.*

*“It still is a little bit of a concern as to why Japan has risen by quite so much so quickly, when some of the fundamentals around the demographics, around the deflationary history, none of that has really changed.”*",2024-02-23 18:38:11,2024-02-29 15:29:42.625251,5 days 20:51:31.625251,64,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ay83a0/with_global_stocks_at_alltime_highs_investors/

1ay60ju,stocks,Block shares surge after company announces surprise profit,"Block stock rose 20% in Friday morning trading after the payments company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on gross profit and showed strong growth in its Square and Cash App revenue.

Here’s how the company did, compared to an analyst consensus from LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 45 cents, adjusted. Not comparable to estimates.

Revenue: $5.77 billion vs. $5.70 billion expected

Block posted $2.03 billion in gross profit, up 22% from a year ago. Analysts tend to focus on gross profit as a more accurate measurement of the company’s core transactional businesses.

The company raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast to at least $2.63 billion from $2.40 billion.

Block, formerly known as Square, ended the year with 56 million monthly transacting actives for Cash App in December, with most of those customers using it for either peer-to-peer payments or the Cash App Card.

Its Cash App business reported $1.18 billion in gross profit, a 25% year-over-year rise.

The company, which is run by Jack Dorsey, said its Cash App Card has 23 million monthly actives in December, up 20%. That is more than two times the growth rate of total monthly actives.

“We believe this strategy will enable us to build the largest network in the long run, with a highly engaged customer base using Cash App as their primary banking solution,” Dorsey said in a note to shareholders.

The payments firm has focused on slimming down operations in recent months. In January, the Block CEO reportedly said in a note to staffers that the company had laid off a “large number” of workers. This followed another round of layoffs in December.

Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that the company was now below a previously set cap of 12,000 employees.

“We’re going to operate under this cap until we feel it’s holding us back, which is likely years out,” Dorsey wrote. The company recorded a $70 million charge for severance costs.

The company also took an $132 million impairment on its investment in music streaming service Tidal. Block and Dorsey have had a mixed dealmaking record. The company sold delivery service Caviar to DoorDash in 2019 in a $410 million cash-and-stock deal. It also acquired Afterpay in 2021 for $29 billion, its largest acquisition ever.

Afterpay has struggled since the deal announcement, posting successive quarters of losses throughout 2022. Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that integrating Afterpay more tightly into Cash App and using it to power Cash App’s buy-now, pay-later technology were two focuses for 2024.

Block’s strong quarterly results and full-year outlook prompted Wall Street analysts to upgrade their rating of the stock on Friday.

Wells Fargo upgraded Block to overweight and raised its price target from $65 to $95, while Seaport Research Partners upgraded the stock to a buy and also hiked its price target to $95.

“SQ’s progress over the past several months in terms of streamlining itself organizationally, sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive,” the Seaport Research Partners analysts wrote. “We think there’s more to go.”

1ay2evx,stocks,Lloyds Banking To Start $2.5 Billion Buyback After Profit Beat Expectations,"Lloyds Banking Group launched a 2.0 billion pound ($2.53 billion) share buyback program after it posted better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 despite lower income and a heavier provision.

The British lender on Thursday posted pretax profit for the three months to Dec. 31 of GBP1.775 billion pounds compared with GBP1.06 billion for the same period a year earlier and with GBP1.65 billion expected by a company-compiled consensus.

The FTSE 100 listed bank's net income fell to GBP4.23 billion from GBP4.69 billion for the year-earlier period, missing consensus' GBP4.43 billion estimate. Net interest income made up GBP3.32 billion of the total, against expectations of GBP3.37 billion.

Its net interest margin--the difference between what it earns on loans and pay out on deposits--for the quarter was 2.98%, against expectations of 3.01%. For 2024, it guided for margin above 2.90%--while analysts pencil in 2.96% for the year--as the benefits from higher interest rates which boosted its top line over 2023 start to taper off.

It also sees heavier-than-expected costs for the year ahead as it guided for around GBP9.3 billion in operating expenses, up from its previous view of around GBP9.2 billion and reported GBP9.14 billion in 2023.

Lloyds Banking said that it booked a GBP450 million provision in its quarterly results for the potential impact of the Financial Conduct Authority's review into historical discretionary commission arrangements in the motor finance industry, to which the bank is exposed to through its Black Horse brand.

The board declared a final dividend of 1.84 pence, bringing the full-year payout to 2.76 pence.

1ay1p97,stocks,ExxonMobil oil production breakeven in Guyana?,"Couldn't extract any meaningful figure from their Feb 2024 slides.

Does anyone have a good sense of the breakeven levels? Using Petrobas (PBR) as a reference point i infer that it could be sub $35-$40/bl level, but not confident with my analysis.

And since it's lighter crude, easier on the refinery operators to process. Would be more logical that XOM is selling the production at a PREMIUM over certain WTI or BRENT oil benchmark.

[https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/](https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/)

  
Following ExxonMobil’s commercial discovery at the giant Liza field in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in 2015, it was confirmed that the oil found is of ‘high quality’. The term “High Quality” is commonly used to refer to crude oil which is sweet (low sulphur content) and light (high API gravity).  This means oil which has been determined to rank higher on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Gravity Scale and determined to be of a low sulphur content.  
**This bodes well for Guyana as sweet light crude is the preferred type from which the highest value petroleum products are derived.** However, it is important to note that the price of Guyana’s crude will be dependent on more than just its quality. More on this later.

1axz49p,stocks,"YUM! Brands (YUM) DCF Analysis: KFC, Tacobell and Pizza Hut","**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

YUM! Brands is one of the most iconic companies in the F&B industry, holding the most globally iconic fast food brands from KFC to Pizza Hut. However, having so many strong household names is a double-edged sword for the company. There is a large amount of effort and capital demands necessary to elevate the brands to their highest potential. YUM seems to be conflicted about which brands are they going to focus their attention on and which brands are going to coast by. With a generally negative sentiment surrounding their brands such as the falling quality of these brands overtime, major franchisees failing and competing not based on value but price.  

# Revenue:

KFC or any other YUM brands are unlikely able to keep their franchisees in line with very stringent QC as they could face pushback. YUM brands should’ve established strong QC from the start, taking a leaf out of MCD’s books.  
  
Pizza Hut is losing out to Dominos because Dominos was an early investor in tech which they capitalized on during the pandemic and it led to Dominos being able to steal market shares. Dominos also uses a tactic called “fortressing” where they add stores in established markets to be as near to consumers as possible, making delivery easier too.  
  
KFC’s main growth comes from outside of the US where it is perceived as a “high quality” food product as it came from the West. This is especially true in Asian countries where Western brands are highly regarded. KFC's main expansion plan seems to be along South East Asia or East Asia given their recent large expansion in Thailand and India.  
  
Taco Bell is mainly in the US, so comparing Taco Bell to its closest competitor Chipotle. The main difference between the two is that Taco Bell is almost entirely franchised whereas Chipotle is the opposite. Given that both brands are competing based on providing the most value meal for consumers in terms of pricing and product offerings. I believe over time the strong franchising would provide strong economies of scale for Taco Bell to capitalize on, on top of that with the technology innovation done by YUM, it could be integrated into Taco Bell for even more cost savings allowing Taco Bell to compete better than Chipotle.  
  
When forecasting Total Stores, I believe that historically the number of stores opened was depressed due to the Ukraine War and on top of that the tight interest rate environment. So, as negative sentiments of the war loosens and the interest rate environment improves it will lead to more stores being opened. Better branding from the YUM brand as a whole through marketing and technological innovations such as Recommended Ordering makes being an operator for YUM more appealing. I assumed it took about 4 years for interest rates to be lifted and investor's sentiments to improve. As YUM gets a foothold in more countries and their brand’s power is being proven to more investors it leads to an acceleration in the number of stores opening before tapering downwards.  
  
When forecasting %Franchised, I assume that YUM's ultimate goal is to reach 98% franchised.  
  
When forecasting System sales, as more stores are opened it translates into more system sales. A combination of factors such as increased accessibility, more brand recognition, and stronger customer loyalty means that there is an acceleration in growth rate. However, I’m cautious about how fast this growth will be as Taco Bell once failed in Mexico because even though Taco Bell is considered “cheap” in the US, in Mexico there are other cheaper food alternatives. So, this logic applies to most developing Asian countries.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Store, as historic revenue/company store earned is depressed due to the Ukraine war I assumed that over time it will recover. I believe that Revenue/Company store is matured and unlikely to fluctuate wildly. Accounting for the growing number of franchisees, it will translate into a larger cannibalistic effect on revenue. I assumed that revenue would not grow back to pre-COVID levels at a fast pace and Revenue/Company Store would grow due to larger ticket size as a result of inflation.  
  
When forecasting for YUM's latest addition Habit Burger Grill, as it is a new brand with only 18% franchised the future of Habit Burger Grill is very volatile and could lead to inaccurate forecast if I applied too granular of a model for it. So, I forecasted Habit Burger Grill as a %Y/Y growth.  


# Cost:

Ultimately at base case, I value YUM at $99.80 per share. The stock is overvalued due to the goodwill that the company has built previously. However,  if status quo was to be maintained going forward I believe that the reality of subpar QC in YUM and the splitting of attention between the multiple brands owned by YUM would lead to their stock prices reconciling back to its real value.s to roll this out to all KFC stores by the end of 2023.  
  
In-store kiosks are good because “Kiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences.” - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
“We now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China” - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
  
When forecasting Company Restaurant Expenses, given that over time less of the company’s revenue will be generated through the direct operation of restaurants I assumed that Company Restaurant Expenses tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, given the new technology that YUM plans to implement e.g. Recommended Ordering and In-Store kiosks, it would cut the headcount necessary to operate stores. I assumed that SG&A tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting Franchise Advertising and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1axw4f8,stocks,"Standard Charted lowers income target as China weighs, launches $1 billion buyback","Standard Chartered on Friday rewarded shareholders with dividends and a fresh $1 billion buyback as profit rose 18%, but set out modest growth forecasts that will concern investors amid worries about global banks’ exposure to China.

The bank reported 2023 statutory pre-tax profit rose to $5.09 billion, in line with forecasts, and announced a jump in dividends alongside the buyback.

But the Asia-focused lender set out restrained new guidance, saying it expected income to grow at the higher end of 5-7% in 2024, lower than the previous estimate of 8-10% given last October. The lender booked 13% income growth in 2023 in constant currency terms.

StanChart also said it would aim to increase returns on tangible equity, a key profitability metric, “steadily” from the current 10% to 12% by 2026, abandoning a previous forecast to hit 11% this year.

StanChart took a $850 million impairment mainly from its stake in Chinese lender Bohai Bank, its second time writing down the value of the unit as the lender was hit by increasing bad loans as growth in the world’s second-largest economy sputtered.

The hefty loss in China, a core target for StanChart’s strategy, underlines the challenge it faces to expand in the country as policymakers struggle to arrest a deepening property crisis and revive weak consumer confidence.

A fresh $150 million writedown of its stake in Bohai Bank, following a $700 million hit earlier this year, reduced its value to $700 million from $1.5 billion at the start of the year.

As well as hurting the value of StanChart’s investment in Bohai Bank, China’s real estate woes also hit the British bank directly as it took a further $282 million provision on expected loan losses relating to the sector.

That brought total provisions for its China real estate exposure to $1.2 billion in the last 3 years.

To strengthen its balance sheet and attain positive cash flow, Carvana has been trimming inventory and slashing advertising and other expenses.  
  
The company, which allows customers to buy cars online, became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people opted for readily available used cars instead of buying newer vehicles, which were in short supply due to a global chip crunch.  
  
Carvana said it expects retail units sold in the first quarter of 2024 to be “slightly up” from last year.  
  
CEO Ernie Garcia said the company was on track to achieving its goal of “becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer”.  
  
Carvana said it expects first-quarter retail gross profit per unit to be similar to the fourth quarter, with a potential for upside.  
  
It reported retail gross profit per unit of $2,812, representing a nearly seven-fold increase from the fourth quarter of 2022.

1axl48j,stocks,Rivian and Lucid shares plunge after weak EV earnings reports,"Shares of electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid plummeted Thursday after the companies reported disappointing results and stagnant production in their fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday.

Rivian shares plunged about 25% and Lucid’s stock sank almost 17% on Thursday.

Rivian forecast it will make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, slightly less than the 57,232 vehicles the company produced last year. Lucid said it expects to make 9,000 vehicles in 2024, about 7% more than the 8,428 vehicles it made in 2023.

Rivian’s revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter beat Wall Street estimates, but its net loss per share of $1.36 was worse than expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. The company also announced Wednesday it would cut 10% of its workforce.

“Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on Wednesday’s earnings call.

Lucid reported lower-than-expected revenue of $157.2 million for the quarter, and its net loss of 30 cents per share was in line with estimates, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the macroeconomic environment and higher interest rates also affected the company. He said the company has had to learn to operate in new locations, such as Saudi Arabia, with different market dynamics.

Though companies have invested billions of dollars in EVs, sales have grown more slowly than expected. EVs made up 6.9% of sales heading into December, or roughly 976,560 units, up 1.7 percentage points compared with total sales in 2022. 

Rivian and Lucid make up a fraction of EV sales compared with the industry leader, Tesla. A Cox Automotive analysis found that Rivian accounted for just over 4% of EV sales in 2023, while Lucid made up 0.5%. Tesla controlled about 55% of the market.

Shares of Rivian have dropped about 40% in the past year and have fallen 85% from their initial public offering price of $78 a share in November 2021. Lucid’s stock is down about 70% in the past year and has dropped more than 75% from its IPO price of $14 a share in October 2021.

Rivian and Lucid weren’t the only EV producers Wall Street was watching Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola reported worse-than-expected revenue and a slightly better-than-expected loss per share in its earnings Thursday. The stock traded about flat Thursday, and has lost nearly all of its value since it hit an all-time high of $93.99 in June 2020.

1axj4og,stocks,"Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target.","Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that ""forward earnings"" is 25x. ""Forward earnings"" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future. 

These analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.

Nvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or ""internet"" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.

Since AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.

But will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.

On top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.

Now of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will. 

But this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.

Our next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.  

With the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is naïve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.

Overall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.

All of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures

I ultimately decided on the following:

$25 earnings FY2025(a bit optimistic, that's assuming significant growth this year, more than analysts are predicting)

(5%) negative growth in earnings for a decade followed by 2% terminal growth rate as the industry matures and the race to the bottom ends.

1axgrww,stocks,Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT,"Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”

Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It’s the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.

Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.

The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.

Publishing giant Condé Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.

As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.

It’s also faced challenges with developers and moderators.

In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company’s decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

1ax9c2t,stocks,Why should anyone buy Nvidia when they can buy TSMC/Samsung/Intel and get the same AI upside with less risk?,"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.

The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power.

On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.

TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.

There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC.

**Existing home sales rose 3% to start the year, but higher mortgage rates are already hurting**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/existing-home-sales-rose-3percent-in-january-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/existing-home-sales-rose-3percent-in-january-2024.html)

&#x200B;

*KEY POINTS*

* *Sales of previously owned homes rose in January, boosted by lower mortgage interest rates of November and December.*
* *Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply.*
* *The median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*Sales of previously owned homes rose 3.1% in January to 4 million units on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 1.7% year over year.*

*The count is based on closings, so the contracts were likely signed in November and December, when mortgage interest rates backed off their October high of 8%. By mid-December, the rates had hit a recent low of around 6.6%. Today they are back over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.*

*“While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January’s monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR. “Listings were modestly higher, and home buyers are taking advantage of lower mortgage rates compared to late last year.”*

*Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply. Six months is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.*

*That dynamic is why the market is still seeing pressure on home prices. The median existing home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*All four U.S. regions saw price increases, and 16% of homes were sold above list price.*

*“Multiple offers are common on mid-priced homes, and many homes were still sold within a month. The elevated share of cash deals – 32% – indicated a market full of multiple offers and propelled by record-high housing wealth,” Yun said.*

*The 32% all-cash share was up from 29% in both December and in January 2022.*

*First-time buyers made up just 28% of sales. Historically they make up about 40%, but a lack of lower-priced homes for sale is hitting them hardest.*

*While lower mortgage rates helped boost January sales, today’s higher rates are already once again weighing on the market. A separate report from Redfin showed new listings rose 10% year over year during the four weeks ending February 18, the biggest increase in two months. Signed contracts, however, were down 7% from a year ago, according to the report.*",2024-02-22 15:05:42,2024-02-29 15:29:43.801950,7 days 00:24:01.801950,20,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ax8kh2/existing_home_sales_rose_3_to_start_the_year_but/

1ax1dl6,stocks,Is the Adobe Selloff Overblown?,"Hello,

I’m heavily considering picking up some ADBE shares possibly tomorrow or Friday after some more research on account of the sudden >10% dip in its price the past week. 

I couldn’t find any negative news, and on the contrary, found some positive articles re the introduction of AI tools to some of their products and a pretty decent interview with their CEO. Assuming it’s just an exaggerated drop due to the general volatility in tech the past week for now (direct comp like MSFT and ORCL didn’t plummet as bad however).

Financials look decent and they’ve had yoy growth in revenue and earnings the past few years. also had earnings beats the past four consecutive quarters with an estimated higher consensus eps in q1 this year.

1aw6m1x,stocks,"HSBC’s record annual profit misses estimates on China write-down, shares tumble ","HSBC
’s full-year 2023 pretax profit missed analysts’ estimates on Wednesday, hit by impairment costs linked to the London-based lender’s stake in a Chinese bank, sinking its shares as much as 5%.

Europe’s largest bank by assets saw its pre-tax profit climb about 78% to a record $30.3 billion in 2023 from a year ago, according to its statement released Wednesday during the mid-day trading break in Hong Kong. That missed median estimates of $34.06 billion from analysts tracked by LSEG.

Chief Executive Noel Quinn also announced an additional share buyback of up to $2 billion to be completed ahead of the bank’s next quarterly earnings report. HSBC also said it would consider offering a special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024 after it completes the sale of its Canada business.

With the highest full-year dividend per share since 2008 and three share buy-backs in 2023 totaling $7 billion, Quinn said the bank returned $19 billion to shareholders last year.

HSBC suffered a “valuation adjustment” of $3 billion on its 19% stake in China’s Bank of Communications, Quinn said. In an interview with CNBC following the earnings release, he said this is “a technical accounting adjustment” and “not a reflection” on BoComm.

This write-down was among the items that plunged the bank’s fourth-quarter pretax profit by 80% to $1 billion from a year earlier.

HSBC’s Hong Kong shares reversed gains of about 1% after trading resumed, falling as much as 5%. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
 was up about 2%.

Here are the other highlights of the bank’s full year 2023 financial report card:

- Revenue for 2023 increased by 30% to $66.1 billion, compared with the median LSEG forecast for about $66 billion.
- Net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, was 1.66% — compared with 1.48% in 2022.
- Common equity tier 1 ratio — which measures the bank’s capital in relation to its assets — was 14.8%, compared with 14.2% in 2022.
- Basic earnings per share was $1.15, compared with the median LSEG forecast for $1.28 in 2023 and 75 cents for 2022.
- Dividend per ordinary share was 61 cents — the highest since 2008 — compared with 32 cents in 2022.
Outlook 2024

HSBC, which has a second home in Hong Kong, said it was focusing on the fastest growing parts of Asia, a continent where the bank makes most of its profits.

In an earnings briefing to investors and analysts, the bank said it has completed the sale of its businesses in France, Oman, Greece and New Zealand, and was in the process of exiting Russia, Canada, Mauritius and Armenia.

1aw48q7,stocks,Dividends Are stupid. Here's how Henry Singleton used this knowledge to outperform the S&P500 by 9x.,"TL;DR You don't want your company to pay a dividend.

Dr. Henry Singleton was the CEO of Teledyne from 1960-1986. During his tenure, he was known for his excellent capital allocation. By avoiding the common misconception that dividends were good, he was able to make strategic share repurchases **AND** dilutions to acquire companies. As a result, Teledyne achieved a 17.9% CAGR over 25 years, slightly outperforming the 8% CAGR achieved by the S&P500.

If you had invested $1, you would have received 61x your invested capital vs 6.7x for the S&P 500, simply for understanding why dividends are terrible.

To begin, let's understand what a dividend is. A dividend is a distribution of corporate earnings to shareholders. Great. But what does this really mean? To answer that, we need to understand an income statement and statement of cash flows.

When a business generates a profit, it is generally required to pay taxes on such profit (assuming no tax credits). This is reported as ""Net Income"" on the income statement. Then, this taxed profit moves on to the statement of cash flows. In ""Cash from Financing"", we can see that there are two line items: 

""Common Dividends Paid"" and ""Repurchase of Common Stock""

As we can see, these two line items are treated exactly the same. There is absolutely no preferential treatment for either item. As such, from a financial statement standpoint, these items are identical. However, you as an investor actually suffer from something else: qualified dividend tax.

Nonqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income, the same as employee income. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income. So essentially, you are taxed twice as an investor. 

Well what about capital gains? As it turns out, LTCG are taxed **exactly the same**. So what then, is the difference between a qualified dividend and LTCG? A dividend is a **forced taxable sale event**. Receiving a dividend and selling a stock with no dividend is **EXACTLY THE SAME.** By holding a stock with no dividend, you are given favorable tax treatment as you can decide when you want to be taxed.

From a management standpoint, dividends defeat the entire purpose of investing in a company. When you invest in a company, you assume that the company will use your money to generate a greater return than you can. Why then, would you want this management team to simply return your own money back to you?

Now that we've covered how terrible dividends are, how did Singleton use this basic financial knowledge to outperform the SP500? First, he focused on making sure Teledyne was as efficient as possible. By retaining company profits and not constantly distributing profits (and thereby weakening the business), he was able to make strategic acquisitions. When Teledyne stock was overvalued (with a P/E in the 50s), Singleton was brilliant and **DILUTED** shareholders with by acquiring businesses with overvalued shares. He also **avoided dividends** as he wanted to avoid the double taxation for investors.

When the 1970s bear market hit, many companies suffered due to being overleveraged and constantly paying out dividends in past years. Teledyne was in no such position.

When their stock crashed in tandem in the market, they recognized that their stock was trading at a ridiculous discount to its intrinsic value. They took their war chest and invested $2.5 billion to repurchase **90%** of their stock. As a result, their EPS grew by **40x**. During his tenure as CEO, Singleton made sure to allocate every dollar generated to its maximum potential. As such, Teledyne crushed the S&P500 and made investors incredibly happy.",2024-02-21 05:34:12,2024-02-29 15:29:43.802015,8 days 09:55:31.802016,92,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aw48q7/dividends_are_stupid_heres_how_henry_singleton/

1avuya9,stocks,Amazon to replace Walgreens in Dow Industrial Average on February 26,"Amazon will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the 30-stock index, said on Tuesday. Amazon shares moved up 1% in extended trading.

The move will result in more exposure for investors who bet on the index, which is far smaller than the S&P 500.

The change goes into effect prior to market open on Feb. 26.

“Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.

The company said the revision was “prompted” by Walmart’s 3-for-1 stock split, resulting in lower index weight for Walmart.

1avtsoj,stocks,SolarEdge tumbles 18% on weak first quarter guidance,"SolarEdge’s stock plummeted Tuesday after the company gave weak guidance for the first quarter.

SolarEdge expects revenues of $175 million to $215 million for the quarter, well below Wall Street’s expectations of $406 million.

Here’s what SolarEdge reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 92 cents adjusted, vs. $1.17 expected.

Revenues: $316 million, vs. $354 million expected.

SolarEdge CEO Zvi Lando said the company struggled with a weaker market in the second half of 2023 due to high interest rates and lower prices, which saddled the company with inventory.

“Nevertheless, we believe we are well positioned for the next growth cycle in our industry due to our expanding product portfolio as well as the operational and cost reduction measures we have taken,” Lando said in a statement.

“These horizontal competitors are colluding to create a JV that will cause substantial harm to competition and consumers,” the complaint reads.

1avhbt8,stocks,Walmart beats Wall Street’s holiday expectations as e-commerce sales soar,"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company’s global e-commerce sales grew by double digits. 

The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. 

In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.

Yet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.

Here’s what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.80 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $173.39 billion vs. $170.71 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart’s net income fell to $5.49 billion or $2.03 per share, compared with $6.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue increased from $164.05 billion in the year-ago period.

Walmart said it expects consolidated net sales to rise 4% to 5% in its fiscal first quarter. It also anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.48 to $1.56 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

For its fiscal 2025, the retailer expects consolidated net sales will climb 3% to 4%. Walmart anticipates adjusted earnings will be $6.70 to $7.12 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

Walmart has weathered high inflation better than many other retailers. It has used its value reputation to draw in families across income levels and has leaned into new ways to make money, such as selling ads, expanding its third-party marketplace and offering a subscription-based program called Walmart+.

Comparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, rose 4% for Walmart U.S. At Sam’s Club, comparable sales increased 1.9%, including fuel. 

Global e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year, topping $100 billion in total. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 17% as shoppers used curbside pickup and got orders delivered to their homes.

Advertising has been a fruitful business for Walmart, too. It grew about 33% globally and 22% in the U.S. year over year.

Rainey said the Vizio acquisition will be “an accelerant” for the “high-margin, fast-growing part of our business.”

In the U.S., customer transactions increased 4.3% compared with the year-ago period. However, average ticket, or the amount that a customer spent, declined slightly. 

On its fiscal third-quarter earnings call in November, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company could soon face a deflationary environment, where prices are not just stabilizing, but going down. He said those lower prices could help customers pay for more discretionary items.

On Tuesday, however, Rainey said Walmart sees deflation as less likely now. In some categories of general merchandise, prices are lower than a year ago.

Yet, he added, food prices still rose by low single digits year over year.

“The possibility overall [of deflation] still remains, but prices are more stable than where they were three months ago,” he said.

As many other companies have announced cost cuts, Walmart has done the opposite. It announced in late January that it would open or expand more than 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years. That’s on top of an aggressive plan to upgrade more than 1,400 of its existing Walmart stores to have a more modern look.

Along with those store investments, Walmart said it would raise store manager wages to an average of $128,000 per year and make managers eligible for a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary.

It also announced a 3-for-1 stock split in late January, as shares hovered near an all-time high.

Shares of Walmart closed Friday at $170.36, up about 8% so far this year. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500, which rose about 5% during the same period.

1avg2g4,stocks,Walmart agrees to buy Vizio for $2.3 billion in move to grow its ad business,"Walmart has agreed to buy TV maker Vizio, the companies announced Tuesday, as the largest U.S. retailer grows its high-profit ad business.

Walmart will acquire Vizio for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share, in cash. Vizio shares, which spiked after reports of the deal first emerged last week, closed at $9.53 on Friday.

The big-box retailer announced the acquisition as it reported fourth-quarter earnings.

Walmart and its Sam’s Club warehouse chain have long been major sellers of Vizio devices. But in buying the company, Walmart touted the potential to boost its ad business through Vizio’s SmartCast Operating System, which allows users to stream free ad-supported content on their TVs.

As it pushes for higher profits, the retail titan has tried to expand its media business Walmart Connect, which comes with bigger profit margins than selling groceries or clothing. The segment’s advertising sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter.

“We believe VIZIO’s customer-centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points. We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling,” said Seth Dallaire, executive vice president and chief revenue officer of Walmart U.S., in a statement.

1avg1ey,stocks,"Home Depot beats earnings, sales estimates even as consumers take on smaller home improvement projects","Home Depot on Tuesday said quarterly sales declined nearly 3% year over year, but it surpassed Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations despite the cooler demand.

The home improvement retailer said it expects total sales to grow about 1% in fiscal year 2024, which includes an additional week. That compares with a 1.6% increase expected by Wall Street, according to StreetAccount. Home Depot also anticipates it will open about a dozen new stores during the year. 

On a call with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said demand dipped throughout the year as consumers returned to more typical spending patterns. He added that falling lumber prices and rising interest rates hurt the business.

Home Depot now sees a chance to return to growth, McPhail said.

“Our market is on its way back to normal demand conditions,” he said. “We’re not quite there yet, but the pressures we saw in 2023 are receding.”

Here’s what the company reported for the three-month period ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.82 vs. $2.77 expected

Revenue: $34.79 billion vs. $34.64 billion expected

Home Depot shares more than 3% in premarket trading.

Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter fell to $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, from $3.36 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales decreased from $35.83 billion in the year-ago period.

Home Depot has faced a tougher sales backdrop over the past year. The home improvement retailer is following a more than two-year period when Americans had more time and money to spend on painting and fixing up their homes during the pandemic. 

The company has also felt a pullback in consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items, as some families postpone discretionary purchases because of inflation, put off buying a new home because of higher interest rates or choose to spend on experiences rather than goods.

Throughout the past year, McPhail and CEO Ted Decker described 2023 as “a year of moderation” after the outsized gains during the pandemic.

On Tuesday, McPhail said customers are still putting off bigger projects – especially the large-scale projects that may require a loan – because of higher borrowing costs.  

Yet he said sales throughout the fourth quarter were pretty consistent, except for a decline in January due to colder and wetter weather. He said that temporary drop did not factor into the company’s outlook for the year ahead. 

Average ticket and customer transactions both declined in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Average ticket dropped to $88.87 from $90.05 in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a more typical pricing environment, McPhail said.

As of Friday’s close, shares of Home Depot were up nearly 5% this year. That roughly matches the gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. The company’s shares closed at $362.35 on Friday, bringing Home Depot’s market value to about $360 billion.

1avbsgh,stocks,"Barclays posts fourth-quarter net loss, announces £1 billion share buyback","Barclays on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of £111 million ($139.8 million) as the British lender delivered its first major strategy update since 2016.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected net profit attributable to shareholders of £60.95 million for the quarter, according to LSEG data, as Barclays embarks on a major restructuring program in a bid to reverse declining profits.

For the full year, net attributable profit came to £4.27 billion, down from £5.023 billion in 2022 and below a consensus forecast of £4.59 billion.

The bank also announced an additional share buyback of £1 billion, and will later on Tuesday set out a new three-year plan designed to further improve operational and financial performance, CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said in a statement.

Momentum in Barclays’ traditionally strong corporate and investment bank (CIB) — particularly in its fixed income, currency and commodities trading division — waned in 2023, as market volatility moderated.

In its third-quarter report, the bank warned of the substantial cost-cutting charges that were coming down the pike in the fourth quarter.

1auvy1v,stocks,“Keep your winners”,"This is a piece of advice that people often throw around in this sub and elsewhere regarding investing. The saying implies that if you are coming from a position of wanting to sell some of your stocks, that you should favour keeping those that have performed well during the time that you have owned them.

I think that this premise is flawed, and following it willingly introduces a bias towards your decision making based on nothing but your own personal experience and emotions. 

In my view the price performance of a stock during the time you have owned it should ideally form no part of the calculation of whether to keep the stock. This calculation should be based purely on the perceived fair value of the company and their expected future performance. It is irrelevant whether a stock has gone up while you have owned it. 

So let’s say you buy and the stock enters or continues an uptrend for a couple of years, following this advice you should keep that stock. However you having owned the stock makes no difference to the performance of the company or stock, so therefore in keeping with this logic of favouring your winners, why not just buy any company in a sustained up trend, and discard any in a downtrend? This is essentially what you are doing. Yes you have the safety net of your gains, but you are also presumably realising losses on companies that have performed poorly during whatever time you have happened to have owned them, in a similarly biased manner.

If the idea is “go with the trend” then why not simplify it to this and take out the irrelevant part about you having owned the stock during this trend?

I think this strategy may help emotionally to some degree with investing, by cutting and forgetting about potentially bad buys. This is fine and makes sense. Psychology is half the battle with investing in my opinion. But if it is a psychological trick we should acknowledge this, because the reasoning behind this advice is fuzzy at best. People just seem to latch onto it and pass it on without actually thinking about the mechanism for why it is a good strategy, if it is at all.

I’m not a fan in general of these investing quotes that people tend to throw around. They’re often open to so much interpretation that they can misguide people trying to learn their way in investing, and even trick yourself.

1auvmgt,stocks,Mind the Gap,"TLDR; Gap (GPS) reports Q4 earnings on  March 7th.  I think they’re going to fall short on expectations and guide lower on gross profit margin.  Expectations are high, but the steep discounts suggest a revenue miss.  GPS hired a high fashion guy to make changes.  I have doubts those changes will work.  It’ll turn off the existing customer and Temu is making it difficult to acquire new apparel customers.

The price has run up from less than $8 last summer.  With a $1 EPS estimated for the next 12 months, the forward PE is about 20.  Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have recently reported good earnings; however it was driven by international sales.  GPS had a big Q3 that sent the stock up 50%.  Strong Gap results are priced in. 

Here’s what the stock analysts at CFRA have to say with a price target of $12, down from the current $19.75 share price.  Gap nailed the athleisure trend with Athleta, but now they’ve got tough year over year comparables.

“Our Sell opinion and price target reflect our view that GPS is in a transition period as it continues to close stores of its less profitable brands (Gap and Banana Republic) while seeing a slowdown at Athleta. We expect this transition to continue to weigh on earnings and revenues in the near term. We see potential in the company’s Athleta brand even after revenue growth deceleration in recent quarters and believe the brand is well positioned in the athleisure space. We expect continued promotional activity to plague margins and would steer clear of shares of GPS in the near term while a shakeup in leadership causes more uncertainty surrounding shares.”

Gap hired Zac Posen two weeks ago as creative director of GAP and Old Navy.  His background is in high fashion and judge on project runway.  He does not have a track record of profitably selling mass market clothes.

“Posen isn’t the first person to come to mind in this regard. His eponymous brand, which he launched in 2002 when he was in his twenties, shuttered in 2019. The following year, the “Zac Posen” name and IP were sold to the licensing firm Centric Brands. In 2014, Posen was appointed the creative director for womenswear at Brooks Brothers and served in that role until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.”

https://www.fastcompany.com/91024027/gap-inc-hires-zac-posen-as-its-new-creative-director-hes-a-surprising-pick

I suspect Posen plans to make merchandising changes.  The [clearance sections](https://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=65289&nav=hamnav%3AMen%3ACategories%3ASale#pageId=0&department=75) at GAP have an extra 50% off plus another 20% with the promo code TREAT.  That’s a signal that they are dumping inventory at a loss, either because they want to rebrand, they missed their revenue estimates, or both.  It’s not just the quantity of items with a steep discount.  It’s the full assortment of sizes and colors on quality merchandise.  Part of the large recent share price increase was driven by getting inventory levels under control.  If they went into Q4 with a desirable level of inventory, why did they come out of Q4 needing to slash prices?

Old Navy is supposed to be their profit center.  The women’s [clearance section](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=96964&nav=hamnav%3AWomen%3ADeals%3AClearance#department=136) has 1990 item deeply discounted with an additional 30% off.  My theory is they missed revenue estimates and are dumping inventory to shift merchandising strategy.  They’ll pull forward demand selling at a low gross profit margin to their current customer.  Then their customer will go through a period where they won’t make any full price purchases.  At the same time, they’ll launch their newly designed Posen product.  The current customer liked their old product.  That’s why they were a customer.  GPS will have to acquire new customers.  

Temu and Shein are taking market share.  It’s getting harder to digitally acquire customers as the Chinese companies bid up marketing costs.  They now generate [10% of Facebook’s revenue.](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/temu-is-spending-like-billionaire-2024-02-12/)",2024-02-19 19:09:38,2024-02-29 15:29:43.802118,9 days 20:20:05.802119,5,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1auvmgt/mind_the_gap/

1auipch,stocks,Can a company delist its stock from one exchange and move it to another in a different country?,"I own some shares of a junior copper mining company (Solaris Resources -SLS). The stock is on the TSX.V. 

They have accepted a 100M offer from a Chinese state owned to Corp to buy 15% of their main asset and they are planning on selling the asset to the Chinese once they have completed the permitting process.

The location of the asset is in Ecuador and the company's HQ is in Vancouver,BC. 

The issue is Canada recent spats with China have led to the Canadian Government to put new regulations on mining companies transacting with China. 

The 100m accepted offer is under review by the Canadian Government right now and it feels like it is a bit of a coin toss on whether they will approve it or not.

This got me thinking, if Canada does not approve it, would the company be able to move their HQ and stock to another Country/Exchange that has more favourable regulations regarding China?

The asset in Ecuador is the only one of real value in their portfolio and other than having their head office in Canada they don't have any other ties to Canada. 

Ive been trying to research this topic to no avail as its a pretty rare issue for a company to face.

1augc07,stocks,Questions about Disney's sports streaming play.,"Hey all.  
  
Was going through Disney's latest quarterly earnings call and have a query regarding that. Disney plans to start a massive, all sports channels one-stop-OTT platform with WB and Fox at 33% partnership each this year to consolidate sports under one banner. At the same time Disney plans to launch its flagship ESPN sports OTT platform by fall of next year. Wouldn't the two conflict with each other, marketshare wise, in an already saturated OTT field? Why would Disney announce two back-to-back, very related projects? Is this solely to appease investors ahead of this years GM due to the activist investors? Or is there value in this play?

1astx9z,stocks,Carl Icahn wins seats on JetBlue board after taking stake in airline,"Carl Icahn won his push for seats on JetBlue Airways’ board of directors, according to a statement from the airline Friday, days after disclosing a nearly 10% stake in the New York-based airline and that he was in talks for board representation there.

The two new directors are Jesse Lynn, general counsel of Icahn Enterprises, and Steven Miller, a portfolio manager of Icahn Capital.

Shares of JetBlue were up about 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The JetBlue investment isn’t Icahn’s first investment in the airline industry. In one of his more infamous activist campaigns, the corporate raider took TWA private in the late 1980s, and the airline struggled and filed for bankruptcy.

Icahn said in disclosing his JetBlue stake that he believes the shares are undervalued. JetBlue’s stock is down more than 19% over the past 12 months as of Friday’s close. The NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks the broader sector, is up about 7% during the same period.

JetBlue’s new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, took the helm Monday, and the carrier has appointed a pair of airline veterans to get it back on track.

“Building on our distinct brand and unique value proposition, we are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and all of our stakeholders, and we welcome the contributions of our new board members as we move forward with that common goal,” Geraghty said in a statement on Friday.

JetBlue hasn’t posted a profit since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been cutting costs, trying to become more reliable after a post-Covid travel surge and a blocked merger with budget carrier Spirit Airlines. A federal judge last month ruled against a combination of the two airlines, citing reduced competition.

JetBlue had argued it needed the tie-up to help it compete against the largest American carriers. JetBlue and Spirit are appealing the judge’s ruling.

1asjho9,stocks,"Nike to lay off 2% of employees, cutting more than 1,500 jobs amid restructuring","Nike is cutting 2% of its current workforce, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring, the company said late Thursday.

The Beaverton, Oregon-based sneaker giant said it wants to better use its capital to invest in its growth areas, such as running, women’s and the Jordan brand.

“This is how we will reignite our growth,” CEO John Donahoe said in a memo obtained by CNBC.

“This is a painful reality and not one that I take lightly,” he added. “We are not currently performing at our best, and I ultimately hold myself and my leadership team accountable.”

Nike said the layoffs will take place in two phases. The company will start the first round this week, and finish the second by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, which typically concludes at the end of May. Cuts in Nike’s EMEA region will be on a different timeline based on local labor laws, the company said.

It’s not clear which departments will experience layoffs, but they will not affect retail employees at Nike’s stores or warehouse workers, the company said.

The cuts come as consumers become more cautious in their spending and the retail industry braces for a demand slowdown for discretionary items such as clothes and shoes, which is Nike’s bread and butter.

In December, Nike unveiled a broad restructuring plan to cut costs by about $2 billion over the next three years. It lowered its sales outlook as it prepared for lower demand and wholesale orders, soft sales online and a marketplace that relies more on promotions.

As part of its plan to cut costs, Nike said it was looking to simplify its product assortment, increase automation and its use of technology, streamline the organization by reducing management layers and leverage its scale “to drive greater efficiency.”

Shortly before the restructuring was announced, The Oregonian reported that Nike had been quietly laying off employees over the past several weeks and had signaled that it was planning for a broader restructuring. A series of divisions saw cuts, including recruitment, sourcing, brand, engineering, human resources and innovation, the outlet reported.

It’s not clear how many jobs in total Nike has cut since December.

On Friday morning, Oppenheimer downgraded Nike to perform and lowered its 12- to 18-month price target, citing sluggish consumer demand, lulls in production innovation and competition.

“While NKE is by no means broken, we believe that the company and its brand are transitioning, near-term,” the firm said.

Donahoe said laid off staffers will receive a comprehensive package of financial, health-care and outplacement support services.

“We will emerge stronger and better equipped to fulfill our purpose to serve all athletes and grow the future of sport,” Donahoe said.

>Roku’s stock price dropped 24 percent during the trading day on Friday as investors appeared to show concern over the company’s sliding per-user revenue.  
The worries come despite Roku beating Wall Street expectations after posting a 14 percent increase in customers to more than 80 million served around the globe.  
On Thursday, Roku executives revealed its 80 million customers streamed a total of 29.1 billion hours of content in 2023, up 21 percent when compared to the same metric one year prior.  
Despite this, Roku saw its average revenue per user, or ARPU, drop to $39.92, or 4 percent lower on a year-over basis. It was the first time since 2019 that Roku reported a slide in ARPU.

Wanted to start a conversation about which companies/industries this is going to hurt the most or obscurely gain from it as well as the future.

Don't say NVDA, that's obvious and probably priced well in by now.

My uneducated opinion on this is that it seems like the following will be hurt:

\- Providing video advertising services to networks will die a terminal death

\- Short-form video developers -> won't be needed

Sectors that could gain:

\- Entertainment producers -> lower cost base to financing entertainment

Later on indie game publishers could also gain if generative AI providers lower development costs of indie games.

It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  
  
First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?

How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  
  
This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  
  
This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  
  
They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  
  
How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  
  
Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  
  
\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  
  
\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  
  
\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  
  
\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  
  
The Analogy:  
  
„Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  
  
TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  
  
The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  
  
At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  
  
Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  
  
Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  
  
What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  
  
Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“  
  
\----  
  
NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  
  
Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  
  
NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.  
  
Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  
  
So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  
  
There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  
  
So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  
  
Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  
  
AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  
  
Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  
  
According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  
  
Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  
  
Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  
  
„However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  
  
Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1arwrhv,stocks,Cancer research and breakthroughs in partnership with artificial intelligence. $IDNA," One of the most exciting medicines of the past year have been GLP-1 drugs taking the spotlight but i think major breakthroughs and development in the oncology space are coming this year, specifically with genomic and mRNA treatments, and i think AI will accelerate our progress. This is the new space race, we cant let the Russians win.  
mRNA and genomic research hold great promise in revolutionizing cancer treatment and potentially offering a cure. One key advantage is in the personalized approach they offer. Researching a persons genetics enables scientists to understand the genetic makeup of individual tumors, leading to a tailored treatment that targets the specific mutations driving cancer growth. By analyzing the unique genetic signatures of tumors, researchers can identify vulnerabilities and develop mRNA-based therapies that precisely instruct the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.  
mRNA has demonstrated remarkable versatility and safety in delivering the treatment. Unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation (Nuking the immune system), which can cause severe side effects due to their nonspecific targeting, mRNA vaccines and therapies have shown the ability to selectively target cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. This targeted approach minimizes adverse effects and enhances the effectiveness of treatment, offering new hope to patients battling various forms of cancer.  
I think the true benefit that humanity will have from AI is disease research. The significant contribution of AI lies in its ability to analyze huge amounts of data efficiently and accurately. In cancer research, AI algorithms can sift through extensive genomic data, medical records, imaging scans, and scientific literature to identify patterns, correlations, and potential treatment options that might otherwise be overlooked by human researchers.

1arwrb4,stocks,CBRE ‘Optimism’ Sparks Rally in Embattled Commercial Real Estate,"* Report calms some worries of contagion from wobbly loans
* Optimism could have positive read-through to regional banks
* “Our read from comments on this front is that it is baking in conservatism and giving itself a decent amount of room in the bottom-line numbers if the backdrop changes and negatively impacts the top line,” Paolone wrote in a note. “That’s positive, in our view, and we’d also argue it suggests the business is trending better than feared for all the names in the space at the moment.”

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/cbre-optimism-sparks-rally-in-embattled-commercial-real-estate

(Bloomberg) The commercial real estate sector got a boost Thursday when CBRE Group Inc. reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and suggested the worst was over for the downtrodden market for office leasing.

Shares of the world’s largest commercial real estate stock jumped to the highest level in almost two years, while all but one of the 31 members in the S&P 500 Real Estate Index closed the day in the green. Smaller peers including Cushman & Wakefield Plc and Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. both gained more than 8%.

“We are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for office leasing, particularly for Class A properties where we generate approximately two-thirds of our leasing revenue,” CBRE said in a call with analysts Thursday morning.

That optimistic tone could help quell worries about the market for commercial real estate that have roiled shares in property managers and lenders from New York to Munich and Japan in recent weeks. New York Community Bancorp shares characterized the turmoil after plunging last week when it reported a surprise loss, prompting regulators and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to caution about exposure to the sector.

Office occupancy in major cities around the world has been slow to recover in many instances, leaving property managers and their lenders potentially exposed to losses. CBRE executives said that the worst of that has passed.

“We think it is bottomed out,” said Robert Sulentic, chief executive officer. “There’s just a clear amount of pressure from companies to get their people back into the office. You’re going to see the future be better than the current circumstances have been for a variety of reasons.”

Shares of NYCB rose 6.3%, while a measure of regional bank stocks added 3.6%, the biggest one-day gain since mid-December. The group had been under pressure since NYCB’s surprise loss and as investors scoured balance sheets for exposure to potentially loss-making property loans.

CBRE reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue in the quarter rose more than 9% to about $9 billion, beating expectations for of $8.47 billion.

But it was CBRE’s annual profit forecast that helped ease some concerns about the state of the market. For 2024, the firm said it expects to achieve core earnings-per-share of $4.25 to $4.65, implying growth that is above 10%.

That guide may even be on the conservative side, according to JP Morgan analysts led by Anthony Paolone.

“Our read from comments on this front is that it is baking in conservatism and giving itself a decent amount of room in the bottom-line numbers if the backdrop changes and negatively impacts the top line,” Paolone wrote in a note. “That’s positive, in our view, and we’d also argue it suggests the business is trending better than feared for all the names in the space at the moment.”

Stephen Sheldon of William Blair also said that there are clear secular growth drivers supporting larger commercial real estate service firms with CBRE leading the industry.

“We believe there could be a multiple re-rating for the CRE group across the cyclical spectrum (early cycle, mid-cycle, and late cycle) that could support returns for CBRE shareholders over the medium term,” Sheldon wrote in a note.",2024-02-16 01:51:04,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100611,13 days 13:38:41.100611,1,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1arwrb4/cbre_optimism_sparks_rally_in_embattled/

1arttut,stocks,"Toast will lay off 10% of its workforce, about 550 employees, as growth slows","Toast, maker of restaurant management software, said on Thursday it will let go of 550 employees, about 10% of its workforce. The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations.

Shares were initially up as much as 16% after hours but then gave back much of the gains.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: Loss of 7 cents per share, vs. loss of 11 cents per share expected

Revenue: $1.04 billion vs. $1.02 billion expected

Toast’s revenue increased almost 35% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. Its net loss of $36 million narrowed from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has committed $250 million for share buybacks.

The pandemic lead many restaurants to adopt Toast’s tools for mobile ordering and payments, which helped double the company’s revenue. Shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, in the midst of that uptick. Demand has cooled since then, down from 37% in the third quarter and about 45% in the second quarter.

Toast faces increasing competition from the likes of Block, Fiserv and Shift4, Bank of America analysts wrote in a December note as they reduced their rating on the stock from buy to neutral.

Despite the competition, transactions using Toast products continue to grow. Gross payment volume, at $33.70 billion, was up 32%, higher than the $33.53 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Toast’s new job cuts should result in $45 million to $55 million in charges, mostly in the first quarter, and $100 million in annualized savings.

Those cuts come weeks after Aman Narang, Toast’s co-founder and COO, replaced Chris Comparato as CEO. Under Comparato’s leadership last summer, Toast started charging a fee of 99 cents for each online order that totaled more than $10. Consumers and restaurant owners objected, prompting the company to eliminate the surcharge.

Narang said on a conference call with analysts that management aims to report operating profit in the first half of 2025.

1arsb5t,stocks,"Shake Shack stock surges 26% on fourth-quarter profit, strong 2024 outlook","Shares of Shake Shack surged 26% on Thursday after the burger chain delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings results.

The stock reached a new 52-week high of $98.90 and is up more than 67% in the last 12 months.

Here’s how the company performed during the period, compared with estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 2 cents vs. 1 cent expected
Revenue: $286.2 million vs. $280.3 million expected
For the last three months of 2023, Shake Shack reported a net income of $6.8 million, up from a loss of $8.1 million the year prior. Earnings per share increased to a 15-cent profit from a 20-cent loss during the year-ago period.

Adjusting for one-time items, Shake Shack reported earnings per share of 2 cents.

The burger chain also saw a 20% increase in revenue year over year and opened 15 new restaurants during the quarter.

For 2024, Shake Shack expects to grow total revenue by 11% to 15% and open 80 new restaurants — which would bring the total, including company-owned and licensed, to nearly 600 locations, more than double the footprint five years ago, according to the report.

“We ended the year on a high note, with positive traffic in the fourth quarter through the success of our sales-driving strategies and continued margin expansion,” CEO Randy Garutti said in a letter to shareholders. “Our leadership teams are energized and excited as we embark on our 2024 Strategic Priorities and target another year of strong growth and margin expansion.”

1arqkkg,stocks,"Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Results","Comparable restaurant sales increased 9.9% at company restaurants and increased 8.9% at domestic franchise restaurants;

Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $141,653 of which $17,793 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $130,176 of which $16,414 were to-go sales in the prior year;

Restaurant margin dollars increased 21.4% to $176.7 million from $145.6 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales.

1arfamq,stocks,EV school bus company BLBD.  $9 to $31 (and rising).,"I started investing in EV school bus company BLBD at $9/share.  Right before Biden was elected.  I knew that if he won, a national conversion from internal combustion buses to electric would begin.  Today, the stock is at $31.  The EV school bus conversion is just beginning, and BLBD is well positioned for it.

Most school buses fleets are perfect for EV conversion.  Routes and charging schedules are very predictable, and the lower EV bus maintenance costs offset the higher initial investment needed.  And of course, with the Biden administration has come incentives.  Another interesting thing to know is that a charged fleet of buses can be used to power a community in emergencies (this is called V2G, or Vehicle to Grid).

1area1r,stocks,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06

Stable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.02%

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

1ar9uon,stocks,UK economy in recession,"The UK economy has officially entered recession, figures show.

A recession is defined as two consecutive three-month periods where the economy contracts rather than grows.

A major measure of economic growth, gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.3% between October and December, the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.

It's a steeper fall than expected by economists who had forecast a 0.1% contraction.

It followed 0.1% of negative economic growth in the three months from July to September.

The data, however, is just an estimate and is subject to revision.

Currently there are 8,377 active satellites in orbit. It is estimated that there will be 58,000 satellites launched by 2030. The space economy is expected to grow from 469 billion to 1 trillion dollars by 2030. 

I am also excited to see all of the missions planned for the moon. There are many plans for moon landers, manned (and womanned) missions and even plans for moon stations. 

A lot of these space companies will directly and indirectly improve the lives of people here on earth. This means solid and consistent revenue streams for these companies. 

The space industry is just heating up and I think it could continue to grow for the next century. 

Please comment your favorite space company / stock and include why you think it will be a success in the next 10-20 years and beyond.

1ar26eu,stocks,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

1aqy1qd,stocks,Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move,"Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.

It’s the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.

In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here’s how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected

Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

1aqxvmo,stocks,Uber stock pops more than 10% on $7 billion share buyback,"Uber’s stock spiked more than 10% on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company announced it will buy back up to $7 billion worth of company shares.

“Today’s authorization of our first-ever share repurchase program is a vote of confidence in the company’s strong financial momentum,” Uber CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said in a press release Wednesday morning.

Mahendra-Rajah added that Uber “will be thoughtful as it relates to the pace of our buyback, beginning with actions that partially offset stock-based compensation, and working towards a consistent reduction in share count.”

The buyback news comes a week after Uber reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called 2023 a year of “sustainable, profitable growth for Uber,” and told CNBC in an interview Feb. 7 that a shift in consumer spending from retail to services has bolstered the company’s performance.

Uber’s mobility segment revenue was up 34% from the year prior, and its delivery segment’s revenue was up 6% from the year before.

1aqlij6,stocks,Calculating possible range of return on bond ETFs?,"How do you calculate the potential range of returns on bond ETFs? With a plain old bond, I know I will make say, 3% in a year if I hold the bond. But with the ETF it's really unclear to me. Can my return be negative/unbounded-below due to interest rate risk (not considering bonds defaulting)? If so, then that seems to make bond ETFs less appealing because my profit is less certain?

Suppose I have a toy example of a bond ETF X containing 1/3 bonds A, B, C each.

Q1. Does the bond ETF X pay out the coupons from each of A, B and C to me? Hence that's one source of my profit from holding X?

Q2. Since X is traded on the market, I'm susceptible to price fluctuation risk in X (for example due to changing government interest rates, or even just supply-demand of X). But my potential profit should still be lower bounded somehow by the principal that's paid back when A, B, C expire and the face value I paid for X?

Q3. The point of asking Q1 and Q2 is I want to know, at the time of purchasing X, after e.g 1 year of holding X, what will be my range of possible profit? E.g. 2.5% to 3.5%? Or - 10% to +10%?

Assume no issuer defaults/fails to pay back principals on the bonds in the ETF.

This seems like a complicated calculation, I'd really appreciate links to resources understanding this!",2024-02-14 12:16:00,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100733,15 days 03:13:45.100734,2,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aqlij6/calculating_possible_range_of_return_on_bond_etfs/
1aqlc02,stocks,Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue,"Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.

The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.

The cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.

Sony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.

The company’s challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.

Rival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.

Sales at Sony’s gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.

Sony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.

Sony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.

Here’s how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected

Operating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected

Sony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.

Sony’s financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.

Sony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.

Meanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.

Hiroki Totoki, Sony’s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has “great growth potential,” adding that the company will “seek various opportunities” in the country and will look into plans to “replace” the failed merger with Zee.

1aq7nie,stocks,Expectations and Realizations on the current state of the Market,"Today we had a cold plunge into reality, CPI came in hot and stocks corrected, and even thought it probably was a bit over the board, if the market turns sour its never wrong to have a runaway plan. From my perspective the market will keep running, earnings strength has been great overall and this last inflation print is not that bad, next I would like to share my views on some industries and my forecast for the future,  feel free to argue in the comment section.

**ENERGY (OIL) :**

Okay, lets start with the energy market, volatility has been large since 2020, great profits have been made since then. Global mayhem on oil and gas producing countries has generated great buying opportunities on futures, and companies of the sector in general have grown largely in profits, still the market has been very wary in pricing them for several reasons, but mainly because of over the board positive predictions on switching the economy towards green energy. During the economic boom of the last decade this could be seen as possible, but the switch is cost heavy and the money right now is not there. As off right now crude oil is on the rise, the march 2024 contract goes for 77.83$ during the last month it has risen 7%, tensions in the middle east are high and it can cause a sharp rise in prices, I would not be surprised if it reaches 90$ in the recent future.

Personally im positive on the oil market and currently hold positions in Petrobras (PBR) and Chevron (CVX) recent earnings on both companies have been great, currently I don’t plan in selling those positions.

The TECH ride has been wild for the last few months, micro chips companies have been rising with a strength that has yet to be broken, NVDA leads the rise 64% positive in the last 6 months, but id like to remark the META Phoenix rising to beat the shit out of any bear that dared shorting it.

Personally I have mostly sold out of the large names of the sector already fearing they might be a bit overbought, but still hold two highly speculative positions. SoFi which I acquired pretty recently and RKLB which I have been holding for a while now. Sincerely I like both of the businesses, but they are stupidly speculative and if anything goes wrong they dump heavily as any small stock would.

&#x200B;

**BANKING AND FINANCE:**

&#x200B;

Today we got smacked down in this sector, I sincerely don't care for the CPI print, rates will inevitably come down, and when this happens the banking sector will boom, I was great at timing the top of the interest rate hike and at that time bought into Citigroup ( C ),  BANK OF AMERICA ( BAC ) and TLT ( ETF for treasury bonds with maturity over 20 years) .

My outlook for the sector is good, Bonds will get great capital gains as interest rates come down, specially longer durations which where severely punished during the banking Schism of 2022-2023, I will probably mantain those 3 positions for a few years until rates drop low enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PHARMA:**

&#x200B;

The dear child of 2020 has been dropped from the top of the skyrise, the patent cliff is coming for companies like pfizer and the sector in general seems to have no bottom, personally I don't own anything here, but if Mr Market keeps beating the shit out of the sector it will inevitably generate good opportunities.

&#x200B;

**Media/Streamers:**

&#x200B;

Controversial and Volatile sector to say the least, somehow Netflix seems to be winning the streamer wars (for some reason everyone is addicted to Suits 4 years later. Go figure) behind Netflix we have Disney coming out of heavy losses from 2023, but still in the race and a bit further behind we get WBD and PARA that are just trying to survive at this point. As long as the consumer remains strong PARA and WBD might be able to keep their heads out of the water.

Personally im holding WBD for about a year and a half now, it has not really done anything, some times im up, some times im down. At the moment it just seemed like a great value play that had been beaten a bit too much by the market to pass up. Hell, it still looks like it to me, but im definitely biased.

Still, outside of DC their movies last year where great and their gaming sector is growing pretty fucking fast. MAX numbers are a bit disappointing since they have published award winning series behind one another but still have managed to get marginal growth. For me, the value there is still there for the taking, but thread with caution, debt levels are still not nice at all.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSIONS:**

&#x200B;

Well, those are my views for today, I sincerely think there is no reason for the market to correct sharply , but we should be wary of some drunk valuations being thrown around by Mr Market. What is your outlook on the industries I mentioned above? And where do you think we will find the market 6 months from now?",2024-02-13 23:14:17,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100760,15 days 16:15:28.100760,14,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aq7nie/expectations_and_realizations_on_the_current/

1aq5fl9,stocks,Airbnb reports better-than-expected revenue and beats on guidance,"Airbnb reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter on Tuesday and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period. The stock jumped more than 8% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did:

EPS: 55-cent loss. It’s not immediately clear if that’s comparable to the 62-cent profit estimate, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

Revenue: $2.22 billion vs. $2.17 billion expected by analysts, according to LSEG

Revenue climbed 17% from $1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Airbnb posted adjusted earnings of $738 million in the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $645 million, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb reported a net loss of $349 million, or 55 cents a share, compared to net income of $319 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said its loss included lodging tax reserves and non-recurring tax withholding expenses of around $1 billion.

In its shareholder letter, Airbnb said the company is at an “inflection point” after spending the last three years upgrading and adding features to its main room-sharing service. Airbnb said it’s investing in more under-penetrated markets abroad in 2024, and that it will share plans to expand beyond its core business later this year.

Airbnb said revenue in the first quarter will be between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, while Wall Street was expecting $2.03 billion, according to LSEG. The company said the quarter started out strong, with more than 6 million guests celebrating the new year in an Airbnb.

Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, came in at $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 98.8 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago, and above the 98 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Airbnb said guest demand “remains strong,” particularly for first-time users. The company said that after the “volatility” impacted the business in October, when the Israel-Hamas war broke out, its nights booked growth accelerated through the rest of the period.

Average daily rates increased by 3% from a year ago to $157 in the fourth quarter, and the company ended 2023 with 7.7 million active listings, up 18% from a year earlier.

Airbnb said in the investor letter that it has seen “double-digit supply growth” in active listings across every region, while the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions grew the most.

1aq51rr,stocks,"Instacart to lay off 250 employees, or about 7% of the company","Instacart on Tuesday announced it would lay off about 250 employees, or roughly 7% of the company, as part of a restructuring. The news came as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell roughly in line with analysts’ revenue estimates.

Shares of the company fell 5% in extended trading.

The layoffs are focused in part on middle management and creating a flatter organizational structure, according to Instacart, as well as focusing teams on larger projects, such as advertising efforts on Roku, Google Ads and more.

Three top executives are also departing the company for personal reasons, according to Instacart: COO Asha Sharma, CTO Varouj Chitilian and chief architect JJ Zhuang. Instacart will only backfill the CTO role.

The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $803 million, roughly in line with the $804 million that Wall Street expected, according to analyst estimates from LSEG, formerly Refinitiv.

In September, Instacart went public in one of the first significant venture-backed tech IPOs since December 2021. In its prospectus, the company said it would focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning features into the platform, and that it expected to rely on those features to “drive future growth in our business.”

Instacart shoppers and drivers deliver goods in over 5,500 cities from more than 40,000 grocers and other stores, according to its website. The business took off during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers avoided public places. But profitability has always been a significant challenge, as it can be with much of the gig economy, because of high costs associated with contractor payouts.

The average time an Indian trader holds an option is less than 30 minutes, according to data from mutual fund provider Axis Asset Management Co. “If you want to gamble, if you need diabetes and high blood pressure, then go into this market,” Ashwani Bhatia, a board member on the nation’s top stock market regulator, said last year.

1apwnih,stocks,KOLD and BOIL question.,"I have no idea what to flair this as, sorry.

I decided to play with BOIL and KOLD despite NG being a widow maker (I’ll learn the hard way).

My question here is: what is a realistic expectation for a top and bottom with stocks like these? In the past they both have had ridiculous prices but my understanding is that by design it has infinite decay and will never return to even close to previous prices. KOLD for example is up like 2000% from its lowest recent price. Does it have to stop?

Every day I tell myself I’m about to lose my ass but it just keeps running (I have stops) this makes me wonder if there is any math behind finding a cap on a ticker like this. I won’t even begin to understand the math behind it but I’m interested in it.

1apu7vs,stocks,"Paramount Global lays off about 800 employees, after record Super Bowl","Paramount Global is laying off hundreds of employees, just one day after the company announced CBS had record Super Bowl viewership, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish said Tuesday in an internal memo to employees.

Paramount will lay off about 800 people, or an estimated 3% of its workforce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Paramount Global ended 2022 with about 24,500 full-time and part-time employees.

Affected workers will be notified Tuesday, Bakish said in the note.

“These adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead – and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about,” Bakish wrote in the note.

Deadline first reported the number of cuts last month.

Paramount Global owns a variety of assets including CBS, Paramount Pictures, Pluto TV, Paramount+ and cable networks including Nickelodeon, BET and Comedy Central. The job cuts come as the media company considers merger and acquisition options. Paramount Global has held early merger talks with Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery in recent months, CNBC has previously reported.

The media company had warned employees of impending cuts in an internal memo last month. Bakish said at the time that Paramount Global needed to “operate as a leaner company and spend less.”

Its Paramount+ streaming service continues to lose money each quarter. The platform lost $238 million in the third quarter. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28.

Super Bowl LVIII on CBS was the most-watched television show in history, with an estimated 123.4 million people having watched across all platforms.

CBS charged a record high average $6.5 million for every 30-second advertisement for the Super Bowl according to the research company Guideline.

The network earned tens of millions in additional revenue because the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers went to overtime.

US stock futures retreated on Tuesday, sliding away from recent highs as investors digested a hotter-than-expected January inflation report that showed prices cooling slower than forecasts anticipated.

1aptdad,stocks,"Coca-Cola sales beat estimates, helped by higher prices","Coca-Cola on Tuesday posted quarterly earnings that met expectations and sales that topped estimates, as higher prices helped the beverage maker overcome a volume decline in North America.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 49 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected

Revenue: $10.85 billion vs. $10.68 billion expected

Shares of the company rose less than 1% in premarket trading.

Coke reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.97 billion, or 46 cents per share, down from $2.03 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 49 cents per share.

Net sales rose 7% to $10.85 billion. Coke’s organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 12% in the quarter.

Coke reported unit case volume growth of 2% for the quarter. The metric excludes pricing and foreign currency.

However, North American volume shrank 1%, as demand for Coke’s water, sports drinks, coffee and tea fell. For comparison, rival PepsiCo saw volume for its North American beverage unit fall 6% in the fourth quarter. Pepsi executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings squeezed consumers’ budgets, leading shoppers to seek out private label options or smaller pack sizes.

For 2024, Coke is forecasting organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and an increase in comparable earnings per share of 4% to 5%. The company expects that foreign exchange rates will weigh on both its earnings and revenue for the full year.

Looking to the first quarter, Coke is anticipating a 4% headwind from currency exchange rates on its comparable revenue. The company also expects foreign exchange to slow its earnings per share growth, and anticipates an 8% hit from currency changes during the period.

   * Positive Regulatory Feedback Supports Lifileucel Regulatory Submissions in Europe and Canada in 2024
   * A look at their career section, implies all wheel are in motion. If approved of course.
* **Additional**
   * TIL therapies include IOV-GM1-201 to investigate PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy (IOV-4001) in previously treated advanced melanoma or NSCLC as well as pivotal Cohort 2 in the ongoing C-145-04 trial of lifileucel to support a BLA in cervical cancer following progression on or after chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.
   * A novel interleukin-2 (IL-2) analog (IOV-3001) is in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies supporting its use as part of the TIL treatment regimen following TIL infusion.  

   * Additional research and preclinical studies are exploring approaches to increase TIL potency using CD39/69 double negative TILs and stable gene incorporation enhancements such as tethered cytokines.
* **Typical Bio setback**
   * On Dec 22, 2023, the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IOV-LUN-202 study following a grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse effect, potentially related to the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion pre-conditioning regimen observed in the study.
      * Nuance:  What is reported but  under-reported, is the patient being very ill already and could not be helped by regular treatments. Articles from sites that deliver analysis almost always ignore this. The trial is halted, which the FDA is morally and ethically obliged to do. But, my guess,  it will continue. 
* **Concluding**
   * Getting its melanoma program approved would be huge, as it'd mark THE FIRST APPROVAL of a cell therapy for a solid tumor indication. The company would start to make sales for the first time, and it might even be profitable by early 2025.  
  
If approved, history is made. As to the effect on the stock, over time....

1ap9zxr,stocks,Why would the Fed cut rates?,"Why would the Fed cut rates?

In the past, the Fed cuts rates when the job market or economic growth is constrained. Lately, the reasoning for ensuing rate cuts seems to be “because they can”. And the Fed in the FOMC notes and in JPow's subsequent release commentary seems to corroborate this. He noted multiple times that they are waiting for ""more, consistent data points"" referring to continued low inflation numbers, before cutting rates.

This doesn’t make sense to me. Everything I’ve ever learned about macroeconomic theory and the Fed’s levers note that the fed will increase its rate in times of high inflation and decrease its rate when the market needs an artificial economic boost. But if the Fed continues to nail this “soft landing” the market does not need a boost.

I must be missing something:

Is the macro economic market truly worse than jobs numbers indicate?

Are there longer term risks that are being assumed regarding future macro economic conditions that will most certainly come into play if rates stay high?



The fed has even produced internal directives in the last 5 years declaring that they wanted to work to get to average of 2% inflation while maintaining higher normal rates so there can be more room to cut rates in case of economic weakness.

Why do they seem to be heading towards deviation from this logic? Everyone on the street seems to think the fed is justified in cutting rates and it seems even the fed agrees. But to me it just seems careless and would be an uncharacteristically short-sighted move for this Fed Committee to execute while there’s no economic reason to justify lowering rates.",2024-02-12 20:26:09,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100871,16 days 19:03:36.100872,291,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ap9zxr/why_would_the_fed_cut_rates/

As a result my portfolio is very concentrated into mega-cap stocks but I’ve noticed that is where most of the markets growth has been in the past year or so, I’m still planning to buy more SPY to diversify and gain more exposure to large cap but I’m wondering what the benefit is to owning small-cap, mid-cap ETFs/indexs? 

I heard from somewhere that high interest rates affected small cap more disproportionately, and rate cuts are going to be beneficial. I’m still not convinced because mega cap/mag7 are the main companies showing growth in profitability and strong FCF, debt ratios, and cash holdings which is what value investing mostly boils down to, small-mid cap firms aren’t able to match this and resultantly their historic performance hasn’t been on par with mega cap.

-fixed 2.5% average inflation rate for the next 12 months
-Fed starts interest rate decreases in the second half off the year
-You hold for 1 year, and then sell when the current TIPS rate is back to 1%. You don't have to look back far to see it return to 1%, especially once the fed starts cutting it will drop quickly.

Given all these assumptions, You'd have the below returns from this investment after 1 year.
-With a drop in yield of 0.95% after 1 year, the premium increase (capital gain) with 9 years left in duration would be $1M x 9 x 0.0095 = $85,500.
- With a yield of 1.95%, the interest income would be $19,500.
- The inflation adjusted principal assuming 2.5% inflation would be $1,025,000, or an appreciation of $25,000.  

If you liquidated this position, the return (pretax) after 12 months would be $130,000, or 13% on $1,000,000 invested.

1ap470l,stocks,Is the S&P500 still a safe bet atm?,"So as I'm sure many are aware a good portion of the growth in SP500 has been driven by the mag6/7 and the companies that support it.

My question is: If the majority of growth in an index that is supposed to represent the broader performance of the market is localized to the tech sector, is it still a safe(r) more reliable investment than individual stock picks in the tech sector? 

Will we see a market correction eventually as small and midsized cap companies aren't performing nearly as well as they are being portrayed? I just see everyone talking about hitting 5k for the first time but I'm like can we really consider this still an effective tool at measuring the broader performance of the market if 6/7 companies account for a min of 25% of total cap. I mean shouldn't we be normalizing the growth to reflect this? I thought the whole point was to measure the performance/health of 500 companies not 30 or less like the dow.

I guess the crux of my question is can we really say that investing in index funds like VOO or VTI is safe(r) or as safe of a bet as it used to be 20/30 years ago? What happens if one of the mag 6/7 goes down? We can't expect the US to continue trade tariff policies and funding/engaging in armed conflicts just to keep a company above foreign competition.

Edited to add: 

some of the comments have acknowledged the near-term risk, which is what I was getting at. I apologize for my question being poorly worded. I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling 

*ATM= at the moment*

Second edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall ""health of the economy"" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) 

Third edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set.",2024-02-12 16:36:29,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100888,16 days 22:53:16.100888,321,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ap470l/is_the_sp500_still_a_safe_bet_atm/

Under the terms of the deal, Diamondback Energy is acquiring Endeavor Energy for approximately 117.3 million shares of its common stock and $8 billion of cash, subject to customary adjustments. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions that include antitrust requirements and approval by stockholders. The acquisition has already been unanimously approved by Diamondback Energy's board of directors.

Diamondback Energy will finance the cash portion of the acquisition with cash on hand, its existing credit facilities, and possibly, proceeds from term loans and senior notes offerings, a statement said.

Once the deal closes, Diamondback Energy shareholders are expected to retain 60.5% of the merged entity, which will be headquartered in Midland, Texas, while Endeavor Energy Resources' owners are to hold the rest.

Diamondback Energy's board of directors will expand from 9 to 13 members including Endeavor's Chief Executive Lance Robertson, former Chief Executive Charles Meloy, and two other individuals mutually agreed upon by the companies.

When you purchase an investment property, you’re able to rent out that home and earn money for it. And when it comes to investing in stocks, you can actually do something similar. It’s called stock lending and it allows you to earn extra money for the shares of stocks sitting in your account.

1aof8j9,stocks,Rocket Lab Bear Case,"I have been researching Rocket Lab (RKLB) the past few days and I am trying to build a bull case for it, but I can’t help but feeling bearish about this company. 

First off, their main lines of revenue are going to come from two areas. In the short term, sending other companies satellites to orbit. In the long term, sending their own satellites to orbit. 

I think their short term revenue stream will be successful. They have many missions lined up with multiple companies and NASA. Having your own satellite constellation is the new cool thing to do! There is money to be made there. But I am not sure how long that will last. Peter Beck seems to have similar concerns. 

Beck has said in multiple interviews that the most successful space companies will be vertically integrated and capable of launching their own satellites and it will be critical for Rocket Lab to have their own constellation to be successful. However, he has yet to announce what service their constellation will provide. 

This is where my major concerns lay. Ultimately the most successful constellation is going to be one that provides internet. In my opinion, I don’t think Rocket Lab will have the capital to make this happen. 

Transitioning from launching other companies satellites to focusing on launching their own satellites is going be to be nearly impossible for a public company to pull off. The amount of capital this takes is profound, and I don’t think they will have enough cash on hand just from launching other companies satellites. 

Space X is in the process of creating their own internet constellation now, Starlink, and had to sink over 50 billion dollars into it before it became profitable. Rocket Lab will not have the first mover advantage like space X, and therefore will have to sink even more money into it before their constellation becomes profitable.

Rocket Lab may be profitable in the near term, but I do not see them successfully creating their own constellation that ultimately will need to compete with Starlink. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this.",2024-02-11 18:47:57,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100930,17 days 20:41:48.100930,72,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aof8j9/rocket_lab_bear_case/

1anzzma,stocks,Passive investing bubble brought to you in part by ETF’s,"So you know how in most of the melt up’s/meltdowns there’s usually a product that’s largely responsible? 
Usually no one can see it coming, in 2007/8 it was overlevering bad loans through CDO’s.

Today I was trying to track where the volume was coming from on one of my stocks. I found a declaration of 5% ownership by Blackrock in the SEC filings. So this pointed me towards their Ishares line of ETF’s. These “modified market cap weighted” ETF’s seem to forget the market cap weighted in favour of the modified part. 

Money is being channeled by Vangaurd, Blackrock Etc… into a select few “unicorns”. I believe that’s why there’s no breadth in rallies, the passive investing money hose is selectively focused. 

The investing mandates are created when the ETF’s are established, so all that’s left to do is rebalance. What results from this? The investment mandate might make sense at the time, all of this passive investing pushes the price to levels where the fundamentals don’t quite make sense anymore. The fund managers don’t give a shit, and why would they? It’s not their money and the more they have under management the more they’re earning in management fees. The folks supplying the money are too far removed from the investing to see what’s happening. They buy these “diversified ETF’s” that are professionally rebalanced and diversified with the premise of releasing control to the experts.

Here’s an example: why are AMD and NVIDIA almost equally weighted in the SOXX ETF given that NVIDIA is roughly 6x the size of AMD? They should be weighted proportional to their market caps. When fund managers place this metaphorical finger on the scale it creates buying pressure. ETF’s are enabling market makers to use other people’s money to move the markets. This can snowball as the companies that are given a larger allocation in the semi-actively managed ETF’s gain a larger market cap. As the companies market cap becomes a larger portion of the index the passively managed ETF’s begin allocating a larger percent to the company and so on…

I would also hypothesize that more young people are turning to the markets to get ahead more than ever. Let’s face it, the rich housing markets seem out of reach for a lot of people these days. Higher interest rates perpetuate this further. I would be curious to know how many of you also see the equity markets as your means to get ahead in the midst of unaffordable real estate.

What are your thoughts on this? Poke holes in my ideas if you see flaws. Add to the idea if there’s another angle that you see in this line of thought.

I’m fairly convinced that we’re going to see a meltdown. CRE will likely be one of the catalysts. Office space is very difficult to convert to residential. The logistics of plumbing additional bathrooms, space planning, fixturing appliances etc… make it very expensive.

1antn8d,stocks,"No Stop Loss, Would Stop Limit with low limit be basically the same thing?","Hello,

 I'm looking for some help with Stop limit Sell orders. 

I'm trading on Sofi and they do not offer a Stop Loss when selling shares. Would setting up a Stop Limit with a low limit value be basically the same thing? I am looking to protect myself from a possible large drop in value and limit my losses to 5%.

I know a Stop Loss will turn into a market order and sell at the Market price when the target is hit. Typically I would set the Stop Loss at -5% of the stock value and be done.

From what I understand for the Stop Limit, when the stop target is hit, the limit order will activate as long as it's above the limit price. Does that mean if I set the limit really low will it basically trigger at the market price? For instance if I set the stop at -5% the value of the stock and the limit at -50% the value of the stock. Are there any downsides to doing this?

I appreciate any thoughts anyone has on this.

1anrsxh,stocks,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,"\#AMD’s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  
It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.

$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  
However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  
For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  
EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  
Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  
Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  
Guidance was light:  
Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  
Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  
Client Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  
Gaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD’s overall margins.  
AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.",2024-02-10 22:08:45,2024-02-29 15:29:45.100958,18 days 17:21:00.100958,126,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anrsxh/advanced_micro_devices_amd_171_a_good_long_term/
1anr3id,stocks,"Alphabet (GOOG) $150, Looks like an excellent long term Buy for 3-5 Years","**Alphabet reported excellent results for Q4-2023**  
Overall top line revenue of $86.1Bn grew 13% - third quarter of revenue growth after dipping in 2022. 

**Cloud roared back to 26% growth at $9.19Bn after a muted Q3** \- that should dispel any notion that Google Cloud can’t compete with Azure or AWS, or simply doesn’t have the AI tools. It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  
Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,”  
CEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.”  
**Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes**  
1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are “increasingly choosing Duet AI” to “boost productivity and improve their operations.” This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google’s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google Cloud ""is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini” to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration,  
2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.  
You Tube, which grew at 16% was also slightly better than expected at $9.2Bn  
**Net Profit jumped 52% to $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, (This was in spite of $1.2Bn severance charges)**  
Subscriptions are a $15Bn business now, led mostly by You Tube.  
**Alphabet is an extremely profitable company, it has an operating profit margin of 27%! — that too after all the massive spending on other bets such as Waymo, CAPEX on Al, etc.**  
Alphabet’s earnings should double in the next 4 years to about $10.50 - an 18% growth.  
I believe it is definitely worth buying at a P/E of 21.

1anmhm4,stocks,"Purely in theory, why would anyone ever buy a stock that doesn't pay dividends (in a perfect market)?","*Disclaimer: I am quite new to investing/trading and just recently learned about how to value a company and P/E and DCF and so on, so this question may be very stupid.*

So the reason one buys a stock, ignoring voting rights and other such immaterial gains, is because one expects a return on the investment that in a couple years will be higher than the initial investment.

For a dividend stock this is very easy: say the stock has a P/E of 10, so you pay 10$ today for 1$ of todays earnings. So to keep it simple, we assume the company's cashflow is the same as the earnings and the dividends are the same as the cashflow and that there is no growth, your investment will have paid off in 10 years just through dividends.

Now add to that the fact that you usually choose a company that grows in earnings and the fact that you can sell this stock to someone else at a higher price and suddenly your investment will pay off much sooner.

But now take a stock where the company has publicly stated that they will never pay a dividend, such as ACM Research when I was going through one of their SEC filings. In this case no matter if you hold the stock for 1 day or 100 years, no matter if the company's earnings double every year, you will never see a cent of it. In fact, your investment will have lost money through inflation and cost of opportunity.

So why then do people buy these stocks? To sell them to someone else later. Okay. But why do those other ones buy the stock then? To sell them to someone else later. Okay, but... - you get the point? To me it seems like the greater fool theory at work. You always count on there being another fool to buy the stock off of you.

But if this were a perfect market (it's not) where everyone collectively agrees that non-dividend stocks have no value because they won't ever give you a single cent in returns, then nobody would ever buy such a stock off of you, and the stock's price would collapse. It doesn't matter then how much the company may grow in valuation because nobody will ever see a cent from it.

Now this doesn't apply if you count on the company paying dividends in the future after the growth phase, or it doing a share buyback or such things. But that is why I took the example of a company that has stated that it will never do such a thing, such as ACM Research.

So then, why would anyone ever buy such a stock in a perfect market? What am I missing here?

**EDIT: Alot of people don't seem to get that my question is purely theoretical in nature assuming a perfect market. I get that in real-life thongs work differently. That is why I have several non-dividend paying stocks on my watchlist, including the aforementioned one.**

**But I have also been told that shareholders if they have enough voting power can overrule a company's management and successfully demand the payment of dividends. So in that case then that answers the question even in a perfect market.**

**EDIT2:**

**Another excellent point on why people would buy such a stock even in a perfect market:**

> You need to understand that if you own 100% of stocks then you own the full company. If the company is profitable, there will be people interested in owning it, willing to pay a good price for the stock, pushing the price higher. The more profitable the company is, the more people will be interested in owning the company or at least some part of it. If you buy a stock then at some point someone will want to buy it from you because they will want to get their voting rights from 40% to 60%, something like that

**I think my question has been sufficiently answered then. Thank you.**

**EDIT3:**

**Another reason:**

> The one caveat to this would be the potential for a buy-out. Some small companies don't pay dividends, but are likely to be bought out at some point by a larger company for a price that will be returned to shareholders in cash or new equity.

EDIT4: (last one lol)

What I miss could be important.  Do not read this, rely on it, and make an investment decision based on that.  It is my thoughts and musings, and kind of an explanation of why I did what I did. I am not telling you to do the same.

Background on related post:  I made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17lit6s/the\_arbitrage\_case\_for\_spirit\_airlines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17lit6s/the_arbitrage_case_for_spirit_airlines/)

In that post, I thought that this deal was about 70% to go through.  I am less sure now, although I am still leaning toward it being completed.  This is primarily due to timeline concerns.

THE ANALYSIS

Background:  Spirit and JetBlue signed a merger agreement.  The DoJ sued to Block the deal.  At trial, the DoJ prevailed, resulting in an order by Judge Young blocking the merger.  JetBlue and Spirit appealed that decision to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.  Oral Argument is expected in June.  The current deal price, were it to go through, is $29.85/share.  Additionally, JetBlue pays Spirit shareholders $0.10/month for each share held.  If the deal is not completed by July (I believe 24th), either party can walk away.  If the deal is not consummated, JetBlue must pay Spirit $70 million.  There was a termination fee to be paid to Spirit shareholders as well, but the $0.10/share was being deducted from that particular fee, and it is now $0. $SAVE is currently trading in the $6-$7 range, indicating that the market views the merger as extremely unlikely to succeed.

The currently dominant view expressed in media coverage is that JetBlue and Spirit, who I will refer to as Appellants, have an extremely low chance of success on appeal.  Generally, the media people whom I see expressing this view are not attorneys.  I think of them as lay-people, but they may well have some expertise in finance, etc.  Nevertheless, when they start handicapping legal cases, I can't help but think they're in the wrong wheelhouse.  I am often surprised by just how terrible coverage of legal cases in the media can be.

Here are the main reasons that I think that Judge Young's opinion is likely to be reversed.  I expect, but do not guarantee, that these arguments will be made in the brief of Appellants, which we will see within a couple weeks, albeit, not necessarily in the same order.  They might think of something I missed.  They probably will.  They have a team of attorneys working together on this as their job.  I am doing this alone in my spare time.  It isn't the same.  Now I just want to point out, before I begin, that while I am picking apart Judge Young's opinion, I respect his many years of service on the bench, and this is in no way intended to besmirch him.  Attorneys disagree with each other constantly, and that in no way diminishes either side of a debate.

List of issues (described in greater detail below):

A)  The Court chose the wrong geographic market

B) The Court failed to properly apply the doctrine of estoppel

C) The Court stated but failed to apply the correct legal standard (substantially lessen competition in any relevant market).

D) The Court failed to identify a particular market in which competition was substantially lessened, and failed to conduct the required market specific analysis in that market.

E) The Court inappropriately assigned the burden of persuasion to Appellants, where it should have been assigned to Appellees.

F) The Appellees (DOJ & States) failed to introduce sufficient evidence such that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that they have established a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market.

G) The Court arguably failed to sufficiently weigh the nationwide consumer benefits of the deal.

Ok, now i'm going to dig into the meat of these a little bit.  This is not a legal brief, so there will be cursory and incomplete explanations.  Otherwise, this would be a great many pages long.

A)  The Court chose the wrong geographic market

I submit that the appropriate market was national.  The Court defined the market as city pairs.  The argument used for this is essentially that if I am flying from (for example) Dallas to Fort Lauderdale, and my ticket price goes up, I am not really helped if this is offset by cheaper ticket prices from, say, Oakland to Harrisburg.  Facially, from a lay-person perspective, this is a really compelling argument.  Legally, it is not as cut and dried, however.  When analyzing the relevant market, it is important not only to consider the mobility of consumers, but also the mobility of competitors.  Where you have low barriers to entry and a highly mobile product, it is nearly impossible to successfully monopolize.  This is because if I substantially raise prices, a competitor can just move in and compete.  The airline industry is highly mobile.  Planes (and I know this is shocking) move around.  It is not hard to get slots in most of the airports in which Spirit and JetBlue both operate, and they have made divestitures in the hardest to enter airports, all to make sure that they fall into this category where competition can move in easily, so there is not a specific monopoly concern.  Because we all know airlines shift routes frequently and easily, and because that was established, and because they also compete with each other nationally, I would argue the national market is the appropriate market.  This is a fact specific inquiry, and reasonable minds can differ, but the DoJ was arguing at the same time that the markets were city pairs and that the harm was national in scope, and that just makes no sense whatsoever.  Historically, there have been cases where courts have determined that the appropriate market was national.  I am not aware of any cases where they have determined city pairs were the appropriate geographic markets in the context of an actual airline merger.  They did use them in the NEA case, which was not an actual merger, but in that case the parties agreed to that market definition.  There could be some cases out there that I am not aware of.  If the Circuit Court rules that the appropriate market is National, then it is exceedingly difficult to find any path where this merger is monopolistic, because the big 4 airlines each control, and would control after the merger, a far bigger share of the national market than JetBlue+Spirit.

B) The Court failed to properly apply the doctrine of estoppel

There was a motion to rule that the DoJ be estopped from asserting certain arguments, and that certain statements which they previously made be ""deemed admitted"".  (Here comes a very basic explanation, because there are actually many types of estoppel and similar other doctrines). Basically, the idea is, if you make an argument in a case, and the court agrees with you, and it is essential to the court's ruling, and the court rules in your favor, then you have to accept that argument as the truth when you come back into court again.  You don't get to argue the opposite side of it, because you argued that thing, and you won.  In the NEA case, the government made a whole bunch of statements, about how JetBlue was a Maverick, a unique competitor, the only company that could effectively compete with the Big 4 airlines, etc.  Appellants wanted them to be stuck with those arguments.  The court never decided this issue anywhere that I saw in the case... it just kind of seemed to not rule on it.  Some of the government's experts seemingly contradicted these statements, and wouldn't say that their analysis would hold up if those statements were true.  I will point out, trying to use estoppel against the government is a bit more tricky than using it against a private litigant.  I think it should have applied here, but there are certainly counterarguments and reasonable legal minds may disagree on this.  If I am correct, however, and the Circuit Court rules that the government was estopped from making some of its core arguments, and that some of its expert's testimony was inadmissible because it makes prohibited arguments, that strikes at the very heart of the government's case, and makes it difficult to see how they could prevail.

C) The Court stated but failed to apply the correct legal standard (substantially lessen competition in any relevant market).

To be enjoined, a court is supposed to find that it ""may result in a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market"" - That's pretty right but I am in a groove of typing so I'm not looking it up.  Anyway... there are a few words that are key here ""May"" ""Substantial"" ""Lessening of Competition"" ""Relevant market"".  We already talked about picking a market, but we'll delve into what that means a bit soon..  May, serves to lower the threshold from something like ""will"", for example, but does not lower it to the point of ""might under any circumstances you could ever think of"".  It becomes something along the lines of, could foreseeably reasonably be expected to.  Not a super high standard.  ""Substantial""  takes us kind of to the heart of it.  It can't be a minor lessening of competition.  It has to be something with both duration and severity.  And then ""Lessening of Competition"". Now sometimes price is sometimes used as a proxy here, but really it is not exactly the same thing.  Like... if the cheapest store in town raises prices, that doesn't necessarily mean competition is lessened, if there are the same number of stores, for example.  It is important though, to recognize, that we are dealing with ""in any relevant market"" not ""in any relevant market segment"".  Here, the court defined a market geographically (city pairs) and product market (passenger air travel). I think the geographic market is wrong, as stated above, but lets just assume arguendo that we are using it on appeal. The judge then went on to say, this will harm the type of customer that flies spirit in this market, so this must be enjoined.  That is the wrong analysis.  You have to look at how it affects the whole market, not just spirit customers.  The Court explicitly asked if the DoJ was trying to define a market of cost conscious consumers, and DoJ said no.  Everyone agrees they are not the market, they are a part of it.  This seems pretty likely to be redone by the Circuit Court.  Now I am not saying (in this paragraph) what happens when the right legal standard gets applied properly.  I am just saying, you can't say, for example, my product market is all medical care, this merger hurts people getting knee replacements, so it must be enjoined.  You have to look at what it does to the whole market for medical care, or you've done it wrong, and the Circuit Court needs to redo it.

D) The Court failed to identify a particular market in which competition was substantially lessened, and failed to conduct the required market specific analysis in that market.

The Court opinion laid out what market it was using, and then said, basically, there's bound to be a problem in at least one of these city pairs.  That is, at least according to my understanding, insufficient analysis.  Someone may correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that a Court has to actually find a market with a problem, and analyze that market, and explain why they find that the merger may substantially lessen competition in that particular market, in order to enjoin the merger.  The Circuit Court would likely need to do this analysis de novo, since it literally wasn't done, to enjoin this merger.  There is a problem, however.  If this were the main problem in the case, the Circuit Court would be well within its rights to remand the case back down to the trial judge to do this analysis.  This could, if JetBlue and Spirit don't extend the deal, kill the merger just by running out the clock.  I believe that the Circuit Court will be cognizant of this situation, and understand that we are in a ""justice delayed is justice denied"" scenario, and not do that.  Nevertheless, there is risk there, because Courts do sometimes remand things for further consideration consistent with an opinion saying what they believe a trial judge failed to do. 

E) The Court inappropriately assigned the burden of persuasion to Appellants, where it should have been assigned to Appellees.

Around pages 105-106 of the opinion, the Court stated that Jetblue/Spirit cannot show that a customer will not see increased prices, so the merger must be enjoined (paraphrased).  Now a customer seeing increased prices is not the same thing as substantially lessened competition, as I said above, but that is not the only problem here.  It's the ""Jetblue/Spirit cannot show"".  So... these merger cases are very complicated, and you have burdens of production, which shift in a complex framework, and the burden of persuasion.  The burden of persuasion is with the party trying to block the merger.  It is the government's job to show that competition may be substantially lessened.  It is not JetBlue/Spirit's job to show affirmatively that competition will not be substantially lessened.  It's not the same, but this would be kind of like saying ""the defendant is unable to prove their innocence and is thus guilty.""  It misconstrues who is supposed to do what.  I am not sure that doing this particular analysis differently necessarily results in a different outcome, but it could, and it is a reason not to uphold this decision as written.

F) The Appellees (DOJ & States) failed to introduce sufficient evidence such that a reasonable fact-finder could determine that they have established a substantial lessening of competition in any relevant market.

Assuming, arguendo, that we are using city pairs as the relevant market, lets move forward.  The Judge stated, in his opinion, that the Appellees experts failed to include other airports from the same metropolitan area in their calculations.  This is hugely important.  Their numbers are wrong, like in a missing whole airports sort of way.  When you look at this case, and realize that Spirit tends to operate out of the secondary, less popular airport in most cities (because it is cheaper, has less wait times, etc.), that means that in most origin-destination pairs, we are actually ignoring the biggest airport and most of the air traffic that is supposed to be included in the calculations.  Without those numbers, it seems exceedingly difficult to make a case that the government's experts should be relied upon in showing that this merger will substantially lessen competition.

G) The Court arguably failed to sufficiently weigh the nationwide consumer benefits of the deal.

This one is a bit tricky.  If we assume, again, that we are adopting city pairs as the market, then we also assume, for the moment, that you've found some level of harm in some of those markets, and that viewed alone it would rise to the level of substantially lessening competition, but then you look further, and find that there are substantial gains (which the court found) nationally to competition from the merger, the question is, how do you weigh that.  The Appellants take the position that national benefit can offset regional harm, and the Appellees take the decision that it cannot.  I am not certain, but I think this is unsettled law in the 1st circuit.  If someone has a case either from the Supreme Court or the 1st circuit court of appeals which deals with this head on, I'd love to read it.  My current perspective, subject to being updated with any new information I haven't seen, is that this offset should be considered.  If we look at what is actually going on, and we say that this merger will let JetBlue compete much more effectively with the big 4 nationally, but still block the merger on the grounds of a particular city pair, that seems silly.  Almost any airlines that merge are going to have a substantial presence in the same city SOMEWHERE.  If this means that no airlines can merge, it effectively means nobody can ever effectively compete with the big 4, and we are entrenching that oligopoly in air travel forever.  That seems to be contrary to the intent of the Clayton Act.  I hate relying on policy arguments and I'd much rather have strong case law to point to.  There might be some out there I haven't seen, but I have not seen any for either side of this which is binding on the 1st circuit.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There's a lot more detail that I could have put in above.  There's a lot more research I could have done too, so don't take everything I've said as certain.  My point is, what I look at when I see this case is a pretty strong appeal on all fronts, and what I see reported and reflected in the stock price is an infinitesimal chance of success, and the two don't seem to match.  Either the reporting and the market are wrong, or I am.  Keep in mind, it could be me.  I've bet heavily on this, but I am not an oracle, and there are no guarantees.

There are other reasons this deal could fail, beyond this appeal.  We are looking at a hearing in June, and it's possible we don't have a ruling by July 24.  I doubt it, but it's certainly possible.  DoT has its stuff on hold pending that decision.  I doubt DoT makes a final call by July 24.  JetBlue has said they'll waive that provision and move forward and fight the DoT in Court if necessary, but if the DoT refuses to provide a waiver to allow them to operate under common ownership pending resolution of the certificate issue, it certainly gives JetBlue an out to walk away if they decide they want one.  That is something I see as a risk to the deal.  

Spirit's financial situation in a no-deal scenario is not great.  It is substantially indebted and losing money fast.  It has mostly beat on expectations, but expectations have been bad. It needs to find a path back to profitability.  It's book value is substantially higher than its current market cap and it has substantial assets, substantial liquidity, and expectation of a pretty big settlement coming its way due to engine issues.  I think it is undervalued now, even in the no-deal scenario.  

At the moment, I'm still accumulating, because I think the market is overestimating the risk of bankruptcy and underestimating the prospects of a successful merger still happening, resulting in an undervaluation of the stock.  That doesn't mean you or anyone else should agree.  Do your own research, or hire professionals you trust to assist you, or do both.  Don't just go by what I said.  I'm someone whose Reddit post you read on the internet, who has told you a great many times that he might be wrong.

1an2tcj,stocks,People are sleeping on ESPN Bet $PENN,"(Previous post was deleted due to outside link.)

I believe that PENN is building a flywheel that will allow them to compete with DraftKings and FanDuel at the top of online sports betting in the US and Canada. The funds from their legacy casino business allow them to invest in the growth project of ESPN Bet, where they leverage the social reach, ecosystem, and integration of ESPN to make OSB mainstream.

**First, how are things trading (as of yesterday):**



|Company|PENN|DKNG|MGM|FLTR.L|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue - TTM|6.55B|3.29B|15.38B|9.11B|
|Gross Margin - TTM|2.71B (41%)|1.23B (37%)|7.35B (47%)|5.31B (58%)|
|EBITDA - TTM|0.98B (15%)|-0.86B (-26%)|3.64B (23%)|1.27B (14%)|
|Free Cash Flow - TTM|0.34B (5%)|-0.35B (-10%)|1.49B (9%)|0.58B (6%)|
|**Market Cap**|**3.36B**|**19.86B**|**15.28B**|**29.19B**|

To me, PENN is wildly under priced especially compared to DraftKings. It has 2x the revenue, a higher gross margin (than an online only operator...), and about $1B more in EBITDA, yet DKNG's market cap is trading 6x higher...

PENN also has a 11.33% Short Interest of outstanding shares which is just about 3x higher than the average of DKNG, MGM, CZR, FLTR, WYNN, BYD, and RRR. PENN is the highest % of the group (DKNG is next at 5.44%, yet it's financials aren't as strong)...

**Recent News of ESPN and PENN:**

Bob Iger (DIS/ESPN), during interviews and their earnings call, mentioned that they view ESPN as a foundation of their business. More importantly, they are planning to launch a standalone ESPN app ""in probably August of '25"" before the football season with ***""integrated betting, integrated fantasy...""*** They are obviously also doing the JV with Fox and WB Discovery which means more eyes on ESPN and more potential eyes on ESPN Bet.

To me, Iger is seeing ESPN as a long term opportunity in the growing sports and sports betting category. That means PENN wins. Don't forget, ESPN and DIS have ""$500 million of warrants to purchase approximately 31.8 million common shares of Penn. There are options to receive bonus warrants depending on the performance of ESPN BET.""

Who would ESPN rather promote, their own platform or someone elses? While DraftKings and FanDuel have to pay millions to advertise, PENN and ESPN have developed a strategy that lowers that marketing cost over the long term.

**Ok, how'd the Launch go?**

The lazy answer is we will find out this Thursday during earnings on 2/15. But I'm not here to be lazy...

States report betting revenues independently, so in prep of PENN's earnings next week I tracked their handle sizes over the past 24 months in the states that show online sports betting by operator. I wanted to get an idea of market share changes over the past two years and most importantly, how market share has changed since the launch of ESPN Bet.

For some reason I cannot post the charts here, but maybe I can in the comments. Nonetheless, PENN has dominated the launch. Their QoQ growth in Q4 2024 across IL, IN, IA, MD, KS, NJ, OH, and PE (combined handles) was over 150% when compared to Q3 2023. In each market except New Jersey they are either tied or have surpassed the 3rd largest operator behind DKNG and FanDuel.

This is crazy considering ESPN Bet launched on Nov 14th, halfway through Q4 and PENN mentioned they did not do any advertising in Oct. since they were under the Barstool name and were rebranding the next month to ESPN.

**So in 1.5 months, they were able to grow their entire QoQ handle in these markets over 150%...**

Now this isn't the full story as only a few states they operate in show these figures, and handle is not technically the revenue of the company, but it is a good idea of the market share growth which is what everyone is wanting to see. We will know the real numbers in 6 days.

**But I don't like the app**

Boo, don't care. Short term UI/UX problem that can be solved over time. Facebook was trash early on, so was everything. DKNG and FanDuel's apps were probably trash to begin with. If you want big returns, don't freak out about solvable problems in the short term...

**In conclusion...**

To me, PENN has way more room to run than DraftKings and FanDuel considering they have been a small operator, in fewer markets, in a quickly expanding industry with strong momentum. Portnoy even mentioned that Barstool's reputation made it hard for PENN to navigate the regulated industry and potentially land new licenses.

PENN ""failed fast"" with that poor partnership and is now on the coattails of a \~200M user (and 12M in their fantasy app) behemoth in ESPN that is actively looking to get sports betting integrated deeper into it's ecosystem over the long term...

Currently I have $10.4K in long positions (I see this mostly as a multi year growth play) and \~$6K in Call Options that have been pummeled since I first invested... but today they're doing well.

This brings me to a deeper question. Is it because McDonald’s is in so many ETFs and mutual funds? 

I did a little research and found that over 43 ETFs hold McDonald’s in its top 15 holdings. 

How were ETF managers so unphased by this? Did they just know that McDonald’s has such a strong brand name that their investors would be happy to see it included in their ETF no matter how poorly it was performing.

1an1m8t,stocks,Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/






SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.

The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.

The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.

Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.

Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

""If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there,"" Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. ""You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need.""

Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.
Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.

Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.

In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time.
A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.

Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.




**$30 BILLION MARKET**

According to estimates from research firm 650 Group’s Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.

The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.

Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.

In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.

Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  ""With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell’s around $2 billion, this is a real threat,"" said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. ""It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray.""

**BEYOND AI**

Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said.
Ericsson declined to comment.

650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.

Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.

Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.

**Stock Market’s ‘Rah-Rah Mob’ Confronts February’s Weak Record**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record)

* This month is historically among the three worst for equities
* Building bullish sentiment, Fed signals also raising red flags

&#x200B;

*With the S&P 500 Index coming off its best stretch in nearly four decades, the road gets tougher for investors as the calendar flips to February — historically one of the rockiest times of the year for US stocks.*

*After a torrid rally of almost 20% since October that took the S&P 500 to its first records in two years, there’s ample reason for concern: Artificial-intelligence hype came in for a reality check with the latest batch of big-tech earnings; fevered speculation that the Federal Reserve would start easing next month has gone cold; and valuations remain elevated relative to history, evoking memories of the dot-com bubble for some strategists.*

*And then there’s February’s rough history — it’s the third-worst month for the S&P 500 in the past 30 years, behind September and August, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*

*Some of Wall Street’s biggest optimists are growing worried that the enthusiasm that drove the surge to all-time highs is sending a contrarian signal. In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*

*“There’s a ‘rah-rah’ mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,” betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. “That’s totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you’re asking for trouble.”*

*This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a streak like that since 1986.*

*Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*

*February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. That’s particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January — like they often do — following tax-loss harvesting in December.*

*For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*

*Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn’t about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday’s blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*

*For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who’s left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*

*“I really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “A selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.”*

*She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*

*At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market’s advance over the past year, but he isn’t adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*

*Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&P 500 — Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*

*Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks — even months — before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader’s Almanac, who correctly called the S&P 500’s double-digit rise in 2023.*

*Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*

*“Stocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,” said Hirsch, who sees the S&P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 — or a 4% drop.*

*“Market breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.”*",2024-02-09 18:49:32,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221332,19 days 20:40:14.221333,13,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1amvgxm/bloomberg_is_losing_within_a_week_this_time/

Research has also shown that investors engaging in short selling typically focus on valuations and fundamentals more than the average investor.

Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a “technical analysis”.

Full disclosure, I’ve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.

Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it’s for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don’t think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry. 

The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don’t jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn’t seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they’re soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.

To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest.

1amr6h7,stocks,"PepsiCo earnings top estimates, but quarterly revenue slides for the first time in nearly four years","PepsiCo
 on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as North American demand for its food and drinks weakened.

CEO Ramon Laguarta said that U.S. sales broadly slowed down in the fourth quarter.

“Part of that is a slowdown due to pricing and [consumers’] disposable income situation,” he told investors on the company’s conference call.

He added that U.S. consumers are also shifting their behavior from eating and drinking at home to picking up more of their snacks and Gatorade from convenience stores. But Laguarta expressed optimism about the overall state of the consumer, citing low unemployment and hopes that interest rates will fall by the summer and wages will rise faster than inflation.

Shares of the company fell 3% in morning trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.78 adjusted vs. $1.72 expected

Revenue: $27.85 billion vs. $28.4 billion expected


Pepsi reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.3 billion, or 94 cents per share, up from $518 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the food and beverage giant earned $1.78 per share.

Net sales dropped less than 1% to $27.85 billion. It’s the first quarter since 2020 that the company’s quarterly revenue has declined compared with the year-ago period. Currency exchange rates dragged net sales down by 1.5%.

Pepsi’s organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, rose 4.5% in the quarter, helped by higher prices. But those same raised prices have hurt demand for the company’s food and drinks. Pepsi’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, slid again this quarter.

PepsiCo executives said high borrowing costs and lower personal savings have squeezed consumers’ budgets, particularly in North America, in prepared remarks released ahead of the company’s conference call. They also said consumers are increasingly choosing smaller pack sizes for convenience and their low price points.

Pepsi’s North American Quaker Foods division reported an 8% decline in volume. A voluntary recall of its granola bars and cereals hurt its sales during the quarter, along with weaker growth for the overall category.

Frito-Lay North America, which includes brands like Cheetos and Doritos, posted a 2% drop in volume.

Pepsi’s North American beverage unit saw its volume fall 6% in the quarter.

For 2024, Pepsi now anticipates organic revenue will rise at least 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will climb at least 8%. The company previously forecast an increase in organic revenue on the high end of 4% to 6% and core constant currency earnings per share growth in the high single digits.

“Consumers are likely to remain watchful with their budgets and choiceful with their purchases,” Pepsi executives said in the prepared remarks.

Pepsi is predicting a weaker first half of the year as product recalls dent its North American Quaker Oats business and international conflicts hurt sales in some regions. Executives are expecting international organic revenue growth to top that of North America for the full year.

* The prices consumers pay in the marketplace rose at an even slower pace than originally reported, according to closely watched revisions the government released Friday.

* Updates to the consumer price index showed that the broad basket of goods and services measured increased 0.2% on the month, less than the originally reported 0.3%, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

* While the change is only modest, it helped confirm that inflation was moderating as 2023 ended, giving more leeway to the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates later this year.

The revisions are done as a matter of course for the BLS, but garnered extra attention this year after the market reacted sharply to last year’s changes. Indications that inflation in 2022 rose more than anticipated drove Treasury yields higher and sparked worry from investors that the Fed might keep monetary policy more restrictive.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller, in particular, had called attention to the 2022 revisions, sparking market attention for the latest round.

Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 0.3% for the month, the same as originally reported. Fed policymakers tend to focus more on core measures as they provide a better indication of long-run movements in inflation.

Also, the headline November reading was revised higher, up 0.2% versus the initial 0.1% estimate.

In aggregate, the revisions indicate that headline CPI accelerated at a 2.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the initially stated figures, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

The revisions amounted to “a damp squib,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, though they could exert some influence on the Fed.

“Since some Fed officials were apparently worried about a repeat of last year — when the revision pushed up the monthly changes in core prices in the final few months of last year — the lack of any meaningful change this year, at the margin at least, supports an earlier May rate cut,” Ashworth added.

The Fed priorities the personal consumption expenditures price index as its main inflation gauge. CPI readings feed into the Commerce Department’s PCE calculation. The difference between the two gauges is essentially that CPI reflects what items cost while PCE adjusts for what consumers actually buy, accounting for changes in behavior when prices rise and fall.

Futures market pricing was little changed after the data release.

Traders still largely expect the Fed to hold its benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady when it next meets in March, then cut in May, to be followed by four more quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, according to CME Group projections.",2024-02-09 15:14:11,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221358,20 days 00:15:35.221358,22,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1amqd6z/inflation_in_december_was_even_lower_than_first/

1amq4ap,stocks,What Walmart’s ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,"Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart’s weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.

It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively. 

Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.

The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.

Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.

With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I’m eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.  

Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.

1ammimf,stocks,Consequences of buying equivalent of QQQ in €?,"Hello!

The currency i earn is neither euro nor dollar and j live in Europe.

I have all my stock purchased directly on USA stock in $, however since I'm living in Europe, owning stock also in € would make a lot of sense to me.

There's an equivalent of QQQ etf on European stock market (SXRV.DE) available in €.

To purchase stock, I have to exchange my local currency to either dollar or euro anyway.

I'm considering purchasing euro when it has more favorable exchange rate compared to dollar and purchasing SXRV.DE (Equivalent of QQQ etf).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1amikn3,stocks,Growth stocks-is it starting to feel like early 2021?,"Edit-early 2022.  

I understand no one has a crystal ball.  
I understand the market can remain irrational longer than I can remain solvent.  

Back in early 2021, it seemed like growth stocks could only go up, and even though stock prices were at irrationally high levels, I remember telling myself 'time in the market beats timing the market' ' literally the week before growth stocks took a 50% + beating and would trend down for a year.   

I recognise that I partially lucked out, selling my falling knives and buying back into companies like NVDA sub 150, meta sub 100 etc.   

Most of my investments were in an S&P500 tracker, which obviously had a much gentler fall.   

I currently hold £61k in individual stocks in an account I've sworn to not add money to, and £110k in S&P500 etf that I add £1-2k monthly.  

I'm 31 and still have my highest earning years ahead of me, as a surgeon.

1amih26,stocks,I am a cynical pessimist. How do I ever get to buy a hype?,"The thing is: I am somewhat knowledgeable in the IT / AI field and chose that field as my investment ""playground"". When looking at trends, I tend to have a cynical, pessimistic outlook which, on a technical level, has generally proven to be correct in the past. However, the stock market ignores all this nice technical expertise and trades unfounded expectations and hype -- and I never buy into the hype and look at all those green numbers on my watchlist only.

Some examples: I looked at NVIDIA when the crypto mining hype was on, with a background in high performance computing, and figured their GPUs were not energy efficient enough and this was quite obviously a task for ASICs, which proved correct in hindsight. I decided to stay out of what I considered an unfounded hype -- and missed out on the first big jump. 

I also looked at AI and big data-based predictive analysis and maintenance, back before the \*GPT hype, and with connections to high energy physicists who run serious big data analyses decided that that was not a good fit for typical industry data. Almost no one apart from perhaps the big cloud operators has enough raw data in their enterprise to do meaningful statistical analyses. From what I hear, this is also technically correct as many companies silently ditch their hopes to be able to do predictive maintenance now -- but I obviously missed out on that hype as well.

Can you give me some advice on adjusting my way of looking at the market? I find ""don't worry about the technical realities, the finance people won't understand anyway and just buy the shiny new stuff"" a bit too simplistic and cynical...

1ami49f,stocks,Thoughts on ACMR Stock and Its Future Prospects?,"Hey everyone,

I've been closely following ACMR and its performance in the market, especially with the recent developments surrounding the company. They've recently opened a new facility in Hillsboro, Oregon which seems like a significant step forward in expanding their operations. Additionally, ACMR has updated their revenue outlook, suggesting a more optimistic future than previously anticipated. Their outlook on 2023 revenue from $530 to $545 million and projected 2024 revenue of $650 to $725 million

For people who don't know the company they specialize in developing, manufacturing, and selling single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which is crucial for the production of advanced semiconductors. Their technology is designed to remove particles and contaminants from semiconductor wafers, improving the overall yield and reliability of semiconductor devices. 

Also their earnings have beaten expectations previous times. 

""For the quarter ended in November 2023, ACMR reported earnings of $0.57 per share, which beat the consensus estimate of $0.34 per share by $0.23.
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ACMR/earnings/

In the second quarter of 2023, ACMR reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.10 per share "". 
https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/acm-research-inc-acmr-q2-110506735.html

Considering all these positive developments, particularly in the semiconductor sector where ACMR operates, I wonder why the stock hasn't seen a more substantial increase in its value. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Why do you think ACMR stock hasn't shot up as much as one might expect from a company with such positive indicators? Is there something I'm missing, or is the market not fully appreciating ACMR's potential? Any insights, analyses, or predictions you have would be greatly appreciated.

1am7xnu,stocks,Cloudflare stock jumps 18% on earnings beat as the company wins larger deals,"Cloudflare shares rose 19% in extended trading on Thursday after the web security and content distribution network provider issued results and quarterly guidance that proved more robust than analysts had projected.

Here’s how the company did, in comparison with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 15 cents, adjusted, vs. 12 cents expected

Revenue: $362.5 million, vs. $353.1 million expected


Cloudflare’s revenue rose about 32%, consisted with growth in the third quarter, according to a statement. The company’s net loss of $27.9 million, or 8 cents per share, narrowed from $45.9 million in the year-ago quarter.

CEO Matthew Prince said in the statement that Cloudflare signed its largest new customer deal and biggest renewal to date during the quarter, resulting in the highest annual contract value in corporate history. On a conference call with analysts, executives mentioned business from the U.S. Commerce Department.

Also on Thursday, Cloudflare said Mark Anderson, a board member who was formerly CEO of Alteryx
, is joining Cloudflare as president and replacing Marc Boroditsky. Private equity firms Clearlake Capital Group and Insight Partners announced in December that they would acquire Alteryx for $4.4 billion.

With respect to guidance, Cloudflare called for 13 cents in adjusted net earnings per share on $372.5 million to $373.5 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 12 cents per share in adjusted earnings and revenue of $372.3 million.

For all of 2024, Cloudflare’s earnings outlook was higher than consensus, but the middle of the revenue range missed slightly. The company sees 58 cents to 59 cents in adjusted earnings per share and revenue from $1.648 billion to $1.652 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 56 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $1.652 billion in revenue.

Excluding the after-hours move, Cloudflare stock is up about 8% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained about 5% during the same period.

News stations such as CTV and BNN Bloomberg would be affected immediately, according to an internal memo sent to Bell Media employees on Thursday.

The memo, signed by Dave Daigle, vice-president of local TV, radio and Bell Media Studios, and Richard Gray, vice-president of news at Bell Media, said weekday noon newscasts at all CTV stations except Toronto would end.

It is also scrapping its 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts on weekends at all CTV and CTV2 stations except Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa.

Daigle and Gray said ""multi-skilled journalists"" would replace news correspondent and technician teams reporting to CTV National News in Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, while other correspondent changes would be made in Ottawa.

Earlier in the day, Bell Media's parent company BCE Inc. announced it was cutting nine per cent of its workforce.

The company announced Thursday in an open letter signed by chief executive Mirko Bibic that 4,800 jobs ""at all levels of the company"" would be cut. Fewer than 10 per cent of the total job cuts are at Bell Media specifically.

This round of job cuts is BCE's largest in nearly 30 years, Bibic added during a Thursday conference call.

Some employees have already been notified or were to be informed Thursday of being laid off, while the balance will be told by the spring. Bibic said the company will use vacancies and natural attrition to minimize layoffs as much as possible.

1am6e9r,stocks,Pinterest shares crater 25% on weak revenue and forecast,"Pinterest shares plummeted 25% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a weaker-than-expected forecast and missed on revenue.

Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.


Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.

Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.

Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.

Pinterest’s report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta
, Alphabet
 and Amazon
 all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.

But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.

Prior to Thursday’s report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.

Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.

1am61h3,stocks,"Bloomberg - Arm CEO Says AI Boom Just Beginning After Record-Setting Rally, ""AI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle.""","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-soars-expansion-markets-buoys-211305491.html

Arm Holdings Plc shares surged as much as 64% on Thursday after artificial intelligence spending helped bolster the chip designer’s forecast. And the company’s chief executive officer said the remarkable opportunity presented by AI is still in its early stages.

**“AI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle,” Rene Haas said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we’re only at the beginning.”**

The remarks followed a blockbuster earnings report Thursday, when Arm projected revenue of $850 million to $900 million for the March quarter. That far surpassed analysts’ projections of $778 million. Earnings will be roughly 30 cents, excluding some items, well ahead of Wall Street’s 21-cent estimate.

Arm’s technology is going into an ever-widening array of products, from phones to cars to appliances. The scramble to add AI technology promises to accelerate that expansion, Haas said. In some cases, electronics makers don’t yet know how they’ll fully harness AI — they just want to make sure they have enough computing capacity to handle whatever is coming.

Arm once concentrated on technology for smartphones, but now that market accounts for about a third of sales. Phones today also contain more of the company’s technology per device, helping lift the royalties that manufacturers pay to Arm.

“This is the result of strategies that were put in place a number of years ago that are coming to fruition,” Haas said in the interview. “A lot of folks didn’t really understand the company well and where we fit in: But we’re in a Tesla vehicle, a Ford F-150, we are in a smart camera, a Samsung TV, the smart appliances.”

Arm’s bullish outlook, delivered late Wednesday, helped send the shares on their biggest intraday rally since an initial public offering last September. The stock traded as high as $126.59, adding tens of billions of dollars to Arm’s market valuation.

Another tailwind: The company’s customers are shifting to a new version of its technology called V9, which carries twice the royalty rate of its predecessors. They’re also using more Arm computing cores per device — more than 100 in Microsoft Corp.’s new server chips, for example — which amplifies royalties. Arm is also gaining market share from rival technology in the data-center and automotive markets, executives said.

Arm now expects sales of $3.16 billion to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2024, which runs through March. That’s up from a previous range that topped out at $3.08 billion.

Revenue grew 14% to $824 million in the fiscal third quarter. Excluding some items, profit was 29 cents a share. Wall Street had predicted revenue of $760 million and earnings of 25 cents a share.

Arm’s joint venture in China was a “nice positive surprise” as well, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Child. It contributed 25% of total revenue.

Arm has an unusual role in the semiconductor industry. It licenses the fundamental set of instructions that software uses to communicate with chips. The company also provides so-called design blocks that companies such as Qualcomm Inc. use to build their products.

Under Haas, Arm has been moving toward providing more complete layouts that can be taken directly to the manufacturing stage. That shift makes it more useful to some customers, such as cloud computing companies like Amazon.com Inc., but also more of a rival to some traditional clients, like Qualcomm.

Cambridge, England-based Arm is still 90%-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the business in 2016 for $32 billion. An IPO in 2023 raised $4.9 billion, marking the biggest debut on a US exchange in 2023.


Arm’s licensing sales rose 18% to $354 million last quarter, and royalty revenue gained 11% to $470 million.

Arm’s customer list spans the technology industry. Apple Inc. uses its instruction set for the processors that power the iPhone and Mac computers. Amazon relies on Arm designs for its Graviton server processors for data centers. And Qualcomm and MediaTek Inc. are major users of Arm’s blueprints for smartphone processors.",2024-02-08 20:56:51,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221421,20 days 18:32:55.221421,139,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1am61h3/bloomberg_arm_ceo_says_ai_boom_just_beginning/

1am4cd4,stocks,(Forbes) Disney shares staged one of their strongest single-day rallies ever on Thursday on the back of the their blowout earnings report.,"**Forbes**: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/02/08/disney-stock-soars-set-for-best-day-since-2020/?sh=39d50f2b1609](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/02/08/disney-stock-soars-set-for-best-day-since-2020/?sh=39d50f2b1609)

  
**Forbes**: **Disney Stock Soars: Set For Best Day Since 2020**.

""Disney shares staged one of their strongest single-day rallies this millennium Thursday on the back of the company’s blowout earnings report, though the entertainment titan still has a ways to go to recapture its former glory on the stock market.

Disney’s stock ballooned almost 13% to just shy of $112 by mid-afternoon, hitting its highest intraday level since Feb. 9, 2023. Should the gains hold, Thursday will be Disney stock’s best day since December 2020 and its fifth-best day since 2000, according to FactSet data.

The dramatic rise for Disney came a day after the company delivered strong quarterly results and projected $4.60 earnings per share for its fiscal year ending in September, which would make 2024 its most profitable fiscal year since 2019.

Bank of America was among several Wall Street firms to dramatically bump its price target for Disney, upping its target from $110 to $130, with analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich remarking they were “incredibly encouraged” by Disney’s bottom line progress under the tutelage of CEO Bob Iger, whose initiatives “are already having an impact” 15 months into Iger’s second tenure at the helm of Disney.""

1am40wo,stocks,Can a corporation buy ETFs,"Forgive my ignorance I've been wondering for a while and having found an answer online yet.

If a corporation made X amount of money in a year, they would be taxed on all money after expenses have been paid for.
There are those who would spend as much money on equipment as possible so they can accumulate assets with before taxed money so they have very few taxes to pay.
So I'm wondering can a corporation by stocks like ETF index funds, or SNP 500 with pre tax money, and would they be able to defer the tax until they sold it many years in the future ???

Maybe I'm asking a foolish question, I just have been wondering this for a while

Say for example

The corporation I own the majority of the shares in Makes 100k. Now I will pay myself a salary of 50k, and the the rest, or the majority of the money left from this year's earning would just be used to buy stocks so my money grows with the market and I don't have to pay tax on that yet.

1am0x8v,stocks,Question Regarding Cisco (CSCO),"For those you who don’t know who Cisco is they’re a tech company that specializes in networking and software. I was looking at this company and something kind of stood out to me. This company absolutely prints money. In 2023 they had 19 billion dollars in free cash flow with pretty consistent numbers before. Margins are high with gross margin at about 63%. They have basically no CapEx. They had operating cash flow of 19.9 billion while only spending 900 million on CapEx. Their debt is almost non-existent. Debt/EBITDA sits at about 0.36 which is one of the lowest multiples I have seen in the market. Especially from a large cap company. They can basically pay off all their debt in a half of year if they wanted too. The main issue that people have with Cisco is that their growth is really really slow. Their revenue has stayed the same for basically a decade which reflects in their stock price with the only exception being in 2023. I guess my question is why doesn’t Cisco do anything with their cash?

They had operating cash flow of 19.9 billion. They spent 900 billion on CapEx. That leaves 19 billion. What do they do with it? They spent 6.3 billion dollars in dividends. That uses about 33% of their cash and still leaves them with 12.7 billion. What else? They repurchased stock. About 4.3 billion dollars went towards share repurchases. That still leaves 8.4 billion dollars that they’re just not doing anything with. Debt payments? Their debt is non-existent. They don’t need to pay down debt. Acquisition’s? Nope, only 850 million. My question is where is all this money going and why aren’t they doing anything with it to grow the business more quickly or reward shareholders? 

They can throw a ton of this money back into the business and to try to focus on growing but they don’t. Ok lets say law of big numbers has caught up and they really can’t grow anymore. If this is the case why don’t they use that cash on shareholders? They do pay a nice easily affordable dividend but they barely grow it. Like literally 1 cent every year. Their stock is cheap (trades at a EV/EBITDA of 10.1) so why are they not buying back stock aggressively. Better yet they can easily leverage some debt and do 20 billion dollar massive stock buybacks and still have a very healthy debt ratio if they wanted. Like why isn’t this company just doing anything? They got all this cash and they’re choosing to barely use it. 

Maybe I am not seeing something so any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",2024-02-08 17:22:12,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221439,20 days 22:07:34.221440,12,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1am0x8v/question_regarding_cisco_csco/

1alyebr,stocks,Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription,"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Google’s rebrand and app offerings underline the company’s commitment to pursuing — and investing heavily in — AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm’s commitment to AI during the company’s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user’s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is “a lot of execution ahead.” Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Google’s Gemini changes are a first step to “building a true AI assistant,” Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google’s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company’s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There’s also a two-month free trial available.

Thursday’s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they’re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google’s former name for the “packaged AI agents” within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ​​subscription will also have access to Gemini’s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users’ content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Google’s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it’s about helping users understand that they’re interacting directly with the AI ​​models that underpin the chatbot.

“Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,” Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone’s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

“We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,” Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That “allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.”

What’s the point of value or fundamental ETFs (FNDX/SPYV) when they are correlated with growth? 

Take todays market where there is a large valuation gap between value/fundamental vs growth. Should a growth sell off start, value will be equally impacted albeit with a lower drawdown.

When the market picks up, it will be growth leading the charge as 2023/2021 saw.

My question is therefore: what is the point of value if it does not hedge against growth sell offs and underperforms in bull markets

Instead, the soaring sea freight has already led to either change of shipment mode (from Ocean to Ocean + Air + Rail + Road, i.e. multi-modal) or delays in procurement / production plan (hoping for improving situation as time evolves).

With the prolonged disruption in Red Sea / Suez Canal, it is supposed that more and more companies will be affected in 2024Q1, earnings releases in April or May this year may look bad ...

KEY POINTS

* Danish shipping giant Maersk on Thursday flagged “high uncertainty” in its 2024 earnings outlook as Red Sea disruptions continue to weigh on the industry.
* Shares were trading 13.5% lower at 8:14 a.m. London time.
* The company said its board had decided to “immediately suspend the share buy-back programme, with a re-initiation to be reviewed once market conditions in Ocean \[division\] have settled.”

*Shares of Danish shipping giant Maersk slumped more than 14% in early trade Thursday after it flagged “high uncertainty” in its 2024 earnings outlook amid Red Sea disruptions and an oversupply of shipping vessels.*

*The company also said that it would be suspending share buybacks on the back of the uncertainty.*

*Maersk said it expected underlying EBITDA (or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of between $1 billion and $6 billion this year, compared to the $9.6 billion recorded in 2023.*

*Shares were trading 13.5% lower at 10:25 a.m. London time.*

*“The impact of this situation is causing new uncertainty for how this is going to play out from an earnings perspective throughout the year,” CEO Vincent Clerc told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”*

*“We have very little visibility as to whether this is a situation that will resolve in a matter of weeks or months, or whether this is something that is going to be with us for the full year,” he added.*

*In a statement, the company added that its board had decided to “immediately suspend the share buy-back programme, with a re-initiation to be reviewed once market conditions in Ocean \[division\] have settled.”*

*It comes as the company reported fourth-quarter profit below expectations Thursday, with EBITDA for the three-month period dropping to $839 million versus the $1.13 billion anticipated by analysts.*

*Global supply chains have faced serious disruption since late 2023 after major shipping companies began diverting journeys away from the Red Sea following a string of attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.*

*The Iran-aligned group has targetted commercial vessels with drones and missiles in what they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians amid the ongoing Gaza-Israel war.*

*The diversions around one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes have pushed up delivery times and costs, with the OECD warning Monday that it could increase inflation.*

*The Paris-based group said that the recent 100% rise in seaborne freight rates, if persistent, could see import price inflation across its 38 member countries rise by nearly 5 percentage points.*

*The rerouting has boosted freight rates for shipping companies, but Clerc said it was unlikely that those increases would feed through to profits.*

*“I don’t think from an earnings perspective, for the industry or for Maersk, when you look at it in its entirety that this is going to be something where we generate significant profit out of the situation,” he said.*

*“It is something where today the amount of cost we’re absorbing in order to keep the global supply chain going is still unknown.”*

I basically went the opposite of this sub, which seems to work out pretty well in general. Most people on here are incredibly biased.

A few commenters were countering my post:

> Any chance you’re a single man? Ask your friends with kids how they travel

I'm.

> I used an airbnb recently and had a fantastic experience. Great host, remote area, lots of value add without all the crazy rules. That said I also live in an area whose housing market has been ruined, in part, by the prevalence of airbnb and institutional investors. Whole neighborhoods built for airbnb. It’s gotten way out of hand and personally I’d love to see the whole thing crash and burn with a few exceptions.

Whole neighborhoods build for Airbnb tells me that there is huge demand still.

> Classic Reddit bias where the people with poor experiences are much more likely to post. Have people had bad experiences, yes. But I’m quite confident the mix of negative reviews here means nothing in the big picture.

I agree.

Lastly, I noticed that my general disappointment with Airbnb is that it isn't widely available in the places I want to travel to - not that I hate the service. Furthermore, I disliked the fact that my building has a lot of Airbnb apartments, which annoys me as a full-time renter. That should tell me that people still book a lot of Airbnbs even though it's annoying for other tenants.",2024-02-08 09:29:54,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221479,21 days 05:59:52.221479,51,0.23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1alrwmt/one_month_ago_this_sub_agreed_with_me_that_i/

1alek9u,stocks,"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales","Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

1aldp6e,stocks,"Disney beats earnings estimates, hikes guidance as it slashes streaming losses","LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the media giant slashed costs while revenue stagnated. 

The company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023. 

Disney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected

Revenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected


Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.

Disney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.

The company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year. 

While no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.

Disney’s earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.

While Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.

Peltz has cited the company’s stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.

CEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney’s theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney’s box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.

Also of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney’s streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company’s theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.

1al93px,stocks,"Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Stock - Hitting all time highs last week, this week, and maybe next week?","My BIL works on Wall Street and will occasionally tell me ""buy X stock."" At Easter last year he blessed me with a ""Buy PANW"" conversation. Since then, I've been buying between $500-1,000 worth of PANW stock each month. So with that said, I have a $8k cost basis position in the stock, and am currently up 79%. ~~I might be biased~~  nvm I am biased with this stock, however, there hasn't been much buzz around the stock on Reddit so I wanted to see what other people thought about the stock..

PANW is a multinational cybersecurity company. According to Wikipedia, the core product is a platform that includes advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings that extend those firewalls to cover other aspects of security. The company serves over 70,000 organizations in over 150 countries, including 85 of the Fortune 100.

Their 2024 Q2 results come out on Feb 20th but as of October 2023 here were their numbers:

||10/31/2023|Annualized|10/31/2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Revenue|$1.878 billion|$7.512 billion|$1.563 billion|
|Cost of Revenue|$473 million|$1.892 billion|$462 million|
|Gross Profit|$1.405 billion|$5.624 billion|$1.102 billion|
|||||
|R&D|$410 million|$1.64 billion|$372 million|
|Sales, G&A|$781 million|$3.124 billion|$715 million|
|Operating Income|$215 million|$860 million|$15 million|
|||||
|Net Income|$194 million|$776 million|$20 million|

Just taking a basic look at these, we see PANW is growing revenues at a good rate, but it's also hyper profitable from a cost of revenue perspective. Their cost of revenue is very low and their gross profit margins are high. For a growing company, this is awesome. They also are increasing R&D while G&A expenses aren't growing at the same rate, but even with these growing costs, they are still making money and making money at a faster rate.

Heading this growth is Nikesh Arora. Now I'll say this, I didn't really know who this guy was before I started looking into this, but after reading up on him, he was a senior executive at Google and formerly the president and COO of Softbank (pre pandemic). He's also got a great reputation as a leader and innovator. The only trickle down methodology i believe in is when you have good leadership.

Also, I don't know how to add pictures but if you take a look at their BOD you can't look at James Goetz and tell me he might not be a super genius based off the size of his head. [https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/about-us/management](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/about-us/management)

Jokes aside, the biggest red flag with this stock is their valuation. A company doing less than $10 billion in sales and hovering around net income of $1 billion is valued at a whopping $114 billion. For comparison, Cisco is a big competitor to PANW and their 2023 revenue was $57 billion, net income: $12.6 billion, and market cap of $202 billion. Needless to say, PANW is heavily overvalued currently.

Moving forward, the cybersecurity sector is rapidly growing and there is room for PANW to keep growing with it. Do you see this stock flopping? Do you see it 2x, 5x, 10x in the coming decade? Would love to hear people's thoughts. As for me, I'll keep buying each month until the numbers stop showing huge growth.",2024-02-07 17:57:23,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221513,21 days 21:32:23.221513,48,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1al93px/palo_alto_networks_inc_panw_stock_hitting_all/

1al4sf7,stocks,Advice needed regarding reverse share split,"Hi everyone,

I am not trading for long time, so I am missing some knowledge here and I truly believe Reddit is the best place to seek for help (lol). I do own stocks of a company and they announced reverse share split (link to the article - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orpea-announces-details-expected-timetable-070000100.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orpea-announces-details-expected-timetable-070000100.html) )

Let´s say I do own 1 mil of shares, with the average price of 0,0169€ / share. My question here is, during the exchange period, is price of the share globally considered being 0,01€ or is my buying price of that specific share being considered? In above mentioned announcement is part saying, that ""The Reverse Share Split is a purely technical exchange transaction with no direct impact on the total value of the Company's shares held by each shareholder.""

If my 1 mil shares is having current value of 16k€ is it going to end up, that after exchange I will loose 6k€ due to exchange or is the exchange made based on ""value of shares"" rather then ""amount of shares owned""?

&#x200B;

\[(1 000 000 existing shares / 1 000 new shares) \* 10€ nominal new share price\] = 10k€ shares value

&#x200B;

Sorry for silly question, this particular purchase was something like ""ah those are for free, let´s buy it and keep it laying down 3-4-5 years"", but now I am not sure how this is going to end up for me and If I am supposed to lose money due reverse share split, I might take it out and invest it somewhere else.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Announcement of reverse share split is 2 days old. I have made a research prior to buying stocks of this company, I knew they are going through restructuralization of the whole company and board of directors and basically they are trying to bring the company back. I have also considered the business area where this company operates and nursing / care seemed fine to me. I don´t want to delete any parts of my original post but also don´t want to look like a dumbo who sorted stock price and bought randomly the cheapest stocks available without thinking or research.

1al45qy,stocks,Macro report: Freight Cost Increases Due to Red Sea Disruption,"# Executive Summary

The ongoing crisis in the Red Sea has precipitated a significant rerouting of maritime traffic, with profound implications for global trade and freight costs. This report examines the economic impact of increased freight costs due to the Red Sea disruption, focusing on the affected companies and industries. The analysis draws on recent data and expert commentary to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation.

## Introduction

The Red Sea, a critical maritime route for global trade, has been experiencing heightened security risks due to attacks by Houthi militants. This has led to a substantial rerouting of shipping traffic, with many vessels now circumnavigating the Cape of Good Hope, resulting in longer transit times and higher operational costs. The disruption has had a cascading effect on freight rates, supply chain dynamics, and global trade patterns.

## Freight Cost Increases

### Container Rates and Surcharges

The redirection of vessels around the Cape of Good Hope has more than tripled container rates since January, with delays and knock-on effects expected to persist well into the second quarter of 2024 ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). The container shipping sector has introduced various surcharges, including the bunker adjustment (BAF), Emissions surcharge (EMS), port congestion surcharges (PCS), and transit disruption charges (TSD), further complicating the market and pushing up container rates ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

### Impact on Shipping Companies

Major shipping companies such as Maersk and CMA CGM have introduced new charges to manage the increased costs associated with longer routes. For instance, Maersk imposed a Transit Disruption Surcharge (TDS) and an Emergency Contingency Surcharge (ECS) on several trade routes ([CNN, 2023](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/22/business/maersk-cma-cgm-shipping-charges-red-sea/index.html)). These surcharges are a direct response to the heightened risks and operational challenges of avoiding the Red Sea.

### Impact on Trade

The rerouting has introduced new inefficiencies in trade, although it is unlikely to derail it entirely. The crisis has masked underlying overcapacity in the shipping industry, which may exert downward pressure on rates once the disruption is resolved ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). However, the current situation has led to a rapid rebound in container rates, with further increases possible ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

## Affected Companies and Industries

### Shipping and Logistics

Shipping companies are directly affected by the increased costs of rerouting and the associated surcharges. The impact on their operational margins is significant, with some analysts predicting a turnaround in sinking margins for container liners in the wake of the Red Sea disruption ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)). The crisis has also led to a rise in insurance risk premiums for sailing through high-risk areas ([The Guardian, 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

### Consumer Goods and Retail

The consumer goods sector, which relies heavily on container vessels for the transportation of finished and semi-finished products, is particularly vulnerable to the increased shipping costs. An estimated 30% of the world's traded consumer goods are shipped through the Suez route, and higher transport costs will inevitably raise costs for shippers and potentially for consumers ([ING, 2024](https://think.ing.com/articles/red-sea-shipping-disruption-rages-on-and-the-impact-will-continue-well-into-2024/)).

### Automotive and Electronics

The automotive and consumer electronics sectors, known for their reliance on just-in-time delivery and global supply chains, are expected to be among the hardest hit by the Red Sea crisis. The rerouting leads to longer delivery times and higher transportation costs, which could affect production schedules and retail prices ([The National News, 2023](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/economy/2023/12/19/red-sea-crisis-to-affect-consumers-worldwide-as-shipping-costs-set-to-rise/)).

### Energy Sector

The energy sector has also been impacted, with global oil prices rising due to concerns over delays in the Red Sea. Crude prices have remained relatively stable but are sensitive to further disruptions ([The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)). Energy companies like BP have halted shipments through the Red Sea, which could lead to higher energy costs if the situation persists ([The Guardian, 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

## Impact on Global Trade and Inflation

The disruption in the Red Sea has contributed to a 1.3% fall in global trade from November to December, with potential implications for global economic growth ([CNN, 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/shipping-costs-have-risen-up-to-250-since-the-red-sea-attacks-began/)). Freight costs have a significant inflationary impact, and the International Monetary Fund estimated that global supply chain bottlenecks added about 1 percentage point to inflation during the Covid pandemic ([The Guardian, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade)).

## Conclusion

The Red Sea shipping crisis has led to a substantial increase in freight costs, affecting a wide range of companies and industries. Shipping and logistics companies are facing higher operational costs and insurance premiums, while sectors reliant on timely deliveries, such as automotive and consumer goods, are grappling with increased transportation costs and potential production delays. The energy sector is also affected, with potential implications for global energy prices. The overall impact on global trade and inflation is significant, with the potential to add 0.7 percentage points to global CPI inflation by the end of 2024 if the situation persists ([The National News, 2024](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/2024/01/09/shipping-costs-have-risen-up-to-250-since-the-red-sea-attacks-began/)).

1al1vuv,stocks,"Alibaba posts revenue miss, hikes shares buyback program by $25 billion","Alibaba missed market expectations for revenue in the December quarter, but announced it is increasing the size of its share buyback program by $25 billion, sending shares to whipsaw after earnings were released.

U.S.-listed shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant were are one point more than 5% higher in pre-market trade, but turned slightly negative after.

Alibaba said the $25 billion increase is added to its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027, bringing the total available under the scheme to $35.3 billion.

The announcement comes as Alibaba released financial results for its December quarter.

Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, compared to LSEG estimates:

Revenue: 260.35 billion Chinese yuan ($36.6 billion) versus 262.07 billion yuan expected.

Revenue missed expectations, growing just 5% year-over-year, logging a slowdown from the previous quarters as growth in the company’s China e-commerce business and cloud computing division remained slow.

Alibaba has been grappling with a difficult macroeconomic environment in China, where the consumer has remained weak, even after Beijing removed its Covid-era restrictions. Amid economic uncertainties, local shoppers have flocked to discounting platforms such as Alibaba rival Pinduoduo.

The Taobao and Tmall business, Alibaba’s China e-commerce platforms, brought in revenue of 129.1 billion Chinese yuan in the December quarter, up just 2% year-on-year.

Alibaba’s cloud computing business, which investors have seen as critical to the tech giant’s future growth, brought in sales of 28.1 billion yuan, a 3% year-on-year rise.

In a statement, recently-appointed Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said the company’s focus is on growth in e-commerce and cloud.

“Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up investment to improve users’ core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year.”

Alibaba had a tumultuous year in 2023, when it carried out its largest-ever corporate structure overhaul. It also separately implemented several high-profile management changes, with company veteran Eddie Wu taking over the reins as chief executive in September.

Daniel Zhang, the previous CEO of Alibaba Group who became acting head of the cloud business in December 2022, was supposed to stay on to lead the business unit, but unexpectedly quit in September last year.

On top of its structural changes, Alibaba also scrapped the hotly-anticipated spinoff of its cloud computing business last year.

More recently, two of Alibaba’s co-founders, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, in January bought shares worth around $200 million in the Chinese e-commerce giant.

1akz739,stocks,The UK Government is looking to sell it's share of NatWest Group [NWG] to the public - so what happens next?,"Following the government bailout of RBS (now NWG) in 2008, the UK Government acquired a stake of 84% of the bank. It has slowly been selling these shares off, and is down to about 40% now. The government are keen to get NWG off their books in the next couple of years, and there is talk of a large public sale of the shares in June.

The stock was bought at 500p by the government, and currently sits at 220p. There is talk that the government would sell at a \~5% discount to the market rate. NWG provides a dividend payment of around 7%, so there could be interest for a deal by private investors.

But what is the likely impact from such a large sale? Surely flooding the market could cause the shares to fall by more than 5%, making the discounted rate pretty meaningless? Or would there be an opposite effect whereby the popularity of buying the shares 'cheap' in the mainstream in a few months would drive the share price up? The shares have fallen from around 300p over the past few months, so there may be market expectations of the former which have been largely baked in.

At any rate it feels like some volatility is ahead.  The Q4 results are announced next Friday.

1akz18x,stocks,$IOVA iovance - THE FIRST approved cell therapy for solid tumor indications (???),"**First Finance, as reported:**

Iovance had $427.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash at September 30, 2023, compared to $478.3 million at December 31, 2022. The current cash position and anticipated revenue in 2024 from lifileucel and Proleukin® is expected to be sufficient to fund current and planned operations into 2025.

**2024 Outlook**

* FDA Priority Review of Biologics License Application (BLA) on Track for Lifileucel in Advanced Melanoma with Prescription Drug User Fee Act Action (PDUFA) Date of February 24, 2023
* Positive Regulatory Feedback Supports Lifileucel Regulatory Submissions in Europe and Canada in 2024

Iovance has reached an exciting point in its growth story. Regulators are reviewing the company's lead product, lifileucel for advanced melanoma, and are set to issue a **decision on or before Feb. 24**. The drug could bring in global sales of as much as **$959 million in 2029**. 

A look at their **career section**, implies all wheel are in motion. If approved of course. 

**Additional** 

*  TIL therapies include IOV-GM1-201 to investigate PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy (IOV-4001) in previously treated advanced melanoma or NSCLC as well as pivotal Cohort 2 in the ongoing C-145-04 trial of lifileucel to support a BLA in cervical cancer following progression on or after chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.
* A novel interleukin-2 (IL-2) analog (IOV-3001) is in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies supporting its use as part of the TIL treatment regimen following TIL infusion.
* Additional research and preclinical studies are exploring approaches to increase TIL potency using CD39/69 double negative TILs and stable gene incorporation enhancements such as tethered cytokines.

**Set back (in one of many studies)**

On Dec 22, 2023, the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IOV-LUN-202 study following a grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse effect, potentially related to the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion pre-conditioning regimen observed in the study.

**Concluding**

Getting its melanoma program approved would be huge, as it'd mark **THE FIRST APPROVAL** of a cell therapy for a solid tumor indication. The company would start to make sales for the first time, and it might even be profitable by early 2025. 

If approved, history is made. As to the effect on the stock, over time....  

You do the math.

[Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results](https://investor.elfbeauty.com/news-and-events/press-releases/landing-news/2024/02-06-2024-210530133)

For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022:

* **Net sales** increased 80% to $702.8 million, primarily driven by strength in both retailer and e-commerce channels. 
* **Gross margin** increased approximately 400 basis points to 71%, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts, cost savings and mix, improved transportation costs, and lower inventory adjustments, partially offset by costs associated with retailer activity and space expansion.
* **SG&A** increased $163.1 million to $364.2 million, or 52% of net sales. Adjusted SG&A increased $150.2 million to $329.5 million, or 47% of net sales. The increase in SG&A dollars was primarily due to an increase in marketing and digital spend, compensation and benefits, operations costs, retail fixturing and visual merchandising costs, depreciation and amortization and professional fees.
* **Net income** was $113.1 million on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income was $152.9 million.

*A sell-off in regional U.S. bank stocks triggered by New York Community Bancorp last week has brought the group's exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) in focus for analysts and investors alike.*

*The industry has grappled with looming losses on CRE loan books since early 2023, as the sector faced the twin challenges of financing difficulties amid high interest rates and lower office occupancy due to widespread adoption of remote work.*

*Investors fear weak demand for offices could trigger a wave of defaults and put pressure on banks and other lenders, which are hoping to avoid selling CRE loans at significant discounts.*

*The CRE worries extend across the banking sector, with several giants including Wells Fargo shoring up rainy-day funds over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, smaller lenders have sought to reduce the risk by raising their loan loss provisions and shedding these portfolios through sales to private equity firms.*

I am quite new to this; so far I only know that I have to look for a low TER and that here, fiscally, it is better to invest in Funds (either passive or active) than in ETFs.

1akmcwx,stocks,A quick explanation on why fractional betting is so important,"Let’s set up a bet:

80% chance to win with 300% return. 20% chance to lose 100%. Expected gain for each round is 0.8 \* 3 + 0.2 \* 0.0 = 2.4 (+120% expected value!).

However, despite this high expected value of each round, if you bet 10 times, reinvesting your returns, you have a 1 - 0.8\^10 = 89% chance of losing everything (because if the 20% chance happens once you’re done and you need a win to happen every time you bet since you’re reinvesting all winnings).

What's going on here?

This is the problem of arithmetic vs geometric means.

Let's take a less extreme example.

Imagine a trade where 50% chance of gaining 20% and 50% chance of losing 20%.

The average arithmetic EV each round is 1.

The average geometric EV is lower, at 0.9797.

This makes sense, given that if you win a round and then lose around, you don't go back to 1, you go to 0.96.

The discrepancy between 1 and 0.9797 is what I'd like to call the ""volatility tax"".

# Moral of the Story

When betting, you want to fractionalize your bets and bet simultaneously. The more fractional your bets, the more your returns approach the arithmetic mean, which is generally higher than the geometric mean.

When you bet your whole portfolio each time, you expose yourself to the volatility tax with much worse outcomes.

If there's a 0 outcome, then there's a very chance you lose everything after a series of bets where you reinvest your whole portfolio.

If you want to dive further into fractional betting, another important concept is how you size your fractional bets based on the estimate win-loss parameters.

A popular way of sizing is through the Kelly Criterion.

# Supplementary Information

The arithmetic EV for one round is (outcome\_1 \* chance\_1 + outcome\_2 \* chance\_2).

The geometric EV for one round is (outcome\_1 \^ chance\_1 \* outcome\_2 \^ chance\_2).

Observant readers will realize that if there's a 0 outcome for the geometric EV case, then it's always 0. This is a known problem for the geometric EV equation and you can resolve this in a few ways:

* If any value is zero (0), one is added to each value in the set and then one is subtracted from the result.
* Blank and 0 values are ignored in the calculation.
* Zero (0) values are converted to one (1) for the calculation.

1akkww1,stocks,"Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‘headwind’","Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.

Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.

Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.


Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.

For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas’s attack on Israel.

“While we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,” Snap said in a letter to investors.

Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.

Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.

Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and “reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.” In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.

Snap’s net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.

Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an “internal forecast” for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of “the unpredictable nature of war,” referring to the Israel-Hamas war.

Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.

Snap’s growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.

Snap and Pinterest are “much smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. “In this environment, the big are getting bigger,”

Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.

1akkvdr,stocks,Chipotle earnings crush estimates as restaurant traffic grows 7.4%,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday posted quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as more customers visited its restaurants.

Shares of the company rose more than 1% in extended trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $10.36 adjusted vs. $9.75 expected

Revenue: $2.52 billion vs. $2.49 billion expected


Chipotle reported fourth-quarter net income of $282.1 million, or $10.21 per share, up from $223.7 million, or $8.02 per share, a year earlier. The company said higher beef, produce and queso costs weighed on margins.

Excluding certain items, the burrito chain earned $10.36 per share.

Net sales rose 15.4% to $2.52 billion.

The company’s same-store sales rose 8.4%, beating StreetAccount estimates of 7.1%. Chipotle said that foot traffic rose 7.4% in the quarter, bucking an industry-wide trend of declining visits. Restaurant giants McDonald’s and Starbucks both reported traffic declines for the last three months of the year.

Chipotle’s sales also received a boost from a 3% menu price increase it implemented in October.

The company opened 121 new locations during the quarter.

Looking to 2024, Chipotle is forecasting full-year same-store sales growth in the mid-single digit range and plans to open between 285 and 315 new locations.

1akkreg,stocks,Ford Motor Q4 Earnings,"Earnings: 29 cents per share adjusted vs 14 cents per share adjusted expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Automotive revenue: $43.2 billion vs $40.12 billion expected by LSEG.


Those results would mark a 73.4% decrease in adjusted earnings per share compared to a year earlier as well as a 3.9% decline in automotive revenue. Ford’s 2022 fourth-quarter results included $41.8 billion in automotive revenue, net income of $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $2.6 billion.

Aside from its earnings, Wall Street will be watching Ford’s 2024 guidance. Analysts expect it to be flat to slightly lower compared to 2023. However, Ford’s crosstown rival General Motors
 last week beat expectations for earnings guidance.

Analysts forecast Ford’s guidance to be roughly between $9 billion and $11 billion, according to investor notes from several analysts.

Ford in November forecast 2023 adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $10.5 billion, about $1 billion lower than previous guidance in light of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.

Wall Street also will be watching for any additional actions by Ford to offset increasing labor costs due to the new UAW contract, which the company said is expected to cost $8.8 billion over the life of the deal, ending in April 2028.

Ford is expected to face headwinds this year, including lower vehicle prices, warranty costs and continued losses for all-electric vehicles. Bright spots are expected to be its Ford Pro fleet unit and traditional Ford Blue internal combustion engine business.

The vehicle is expected to go into production between late 2025 and early 2026, according to a company spokeswoman. It is part of previously announced plans by the Japanese automaker to invest $35 billion in battery-electric vehicles, or BEVs, through 2030.

A company spokesperson declined to provide additional details for the upcoming vehicle, which will likely compete with current vehicles such as the Rivian R1S and Kia EV9.

The announcement comes as consumer adoption for EVs has been slower than many expected, causing some automakers to delay or cut investment plans for all-electric vehicles.

Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, is among the most prominent automakers to say that while EVs are a solution to reach carbon neutrality, they’re not the only one. The automaker continues to invest in hybrids, plug-in hybrid vehicles and other technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.

1akb1yq,stocks,Clean Harbors (CLH) to acquire HEPACO,"Clean Harbors, Inc. (""Clean Harbors"") (NYSE:CLH)today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with Gryphon Investors (""Gryphon"") to acquire HEPACO (""HEPACO""), a leading provider of specialized environmental and emergency response services in the Eastern United States, for $400 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

""HEPACO is a recognized leader in Field Services and its addition will accelerate the growth of our Environmental Services segment,"" said Eric Gerstenberg, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Clean Harbors. ""When providing emergency services, scale and rapid response capabilities are critical. HEPACO's geographic footprint, trained personnel and equipment fleet will enhance our existing business, enabling us to gain efficiencies and offer an even broader range of solutions. Field Services and emergency response have been a hallmark of Clean Harbors since our founding in 1980. We are confident that we can deliver strong shareholder value through this transaction in the years ahead.""

Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, HEPACO has more than 2,000 customers, which it services through more than 40 regional locations in 17 states. Its primary offerings include field services, environmental remediation and emergency response services.

On an adjusted basis, HEPACO is expected to generate full-year 2023 EBITDA of approximately $36 million on $270 million of revenues. Clean Harbors expects the acquisition to generate cost synergies of approximately $20 million after the first full year of operations, which equates to a post-synergy acquisition multiple of 7.1 times. Clean Harbors expects to fund the acquisition through available cash and the issuance of some additional debt financing.

Mike Battles, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Clean Harbors, said, ""The acquisition of HEPACO aligns with our Vision 2027 long-term strategic plan for driving growth through a continued focus on value creation across all areas of our business. We see an excellent cultural fit with our two organizations that should help ensure the success of this acquisition. HEPACO has demonstrated a commitment to safety, environmental compliance and service excellence that matches our principles in these areas. We look forward to welcoming HEPACO's talented team to the Clean Harbors family.""

Key strategic benefits of the transaction for Clean Harbors include:

Complementary product offerings that increase the scale and capabilities of Clean Harbors' Field Services business;
Synergies in areas such as subcontracting, branch network, asset rentals, transportation and procurement;
Expansion of its rail and marine service capabilities through the addition of HEPACO's highly trained people and specialized equipment;
The opportunity to drive additional volumes of waste to Clean Harbors' network of disposal and recycling facilities;
Meaningful cross-selling opportunities, particularly for industrial services and hazardous waste disposal; and
The opportunity to introduce new customers to the Clean Harbors and Safety-Kleen brands, and to deepen relationships with existing customers.
HEPACO employs approximately 1,000 people, operates a fleet of more than 900 vehicles and serves a diverse set of industry verticals. In addition to the company's regional operations spanning 17 states, HEPACO's National Operations center provides 24-hour coverage across the continental U.S. through a network of contractors.

Robb Schreck, Chief Executive Officer of HEPACO, said, ""Given its leading position in environmental and field services, as well as a 40-year history in emergency response, Clean Harbors is an ideal fit for HEPACO. Clean Harbors will provide HEPACO's customers with far greater resources and access to North America's largest network of permitted disposal and recycling assets. This transaction also will offer enhanced career opportunities for HEPACO employees.""

1akb16h,stocks,Boeing's Next Crisis: Aerospace Workers Demanding 40% Pay Raise,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-06/boeing-labor-strife-poses-next-big-risk-to-plane-production

* Machinists inspired by auto workers, Hollywood seek 40% raise
* Labor chief doesn’t want strike, ‘but we’re willing to do it’
* Union leaders will demand a 40% pay raise over three or four years, emboldened by a resurgent US labor movement, a scarcity of qualified aerospace workers and pressure on Boeing to stabilize work in its factories. 


(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. executives have spent the past month grappling with the aftermath of a near-catastrophe on an airborne 737 Max jet. As the US planemaker works through its latest crisis tied to manufacturing lapses, a new risk looms: a labor rift 10 years in the making.

Boeing’s largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, is still smarting over a 2014 deal that sacrificed pensions, locked in minimal raises and tied the hands of activists for a decade. Union leaders will demand a 40% pay raise over three or four years, emboldened by a resurgent US labor movement, a scarcity of qualified aerospace workers and pressure on Boeing to stabilize work in its factories. 

“Our goal is to negotiate a contract that we as a union leadership and our members can accept,” said Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents 32,000 Seattle-area Boeing mechanics. “We don’t take going on strike lightly. But we’re willing to do it.”

Holden sees a path to a successful deal with Boeing, he said in an interview. Even so, he’s prepared to follow the lead of auto workers in Detroit, writers and actors in Hollywood, and fellow machinists at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. in Kansas. Each emerged from walkouts last year with significant improvements in pay and other contract terms. 

A strike would shut down Boeing plants in Washington and Oregon, including assembly lines for its cash-cow 737 jets, crimping output after the current IAM contract expires in September. 

With talks set to start on March 8, labor tensions will add to the scrutiny on Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun. He already faces questions from lawmakers and investors over a spate of manufacturing problems — the latest, an issue with holes misdrilled by Spirit — while the Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up its oversight and capped production increases for the 737 until quality improves.

“We remain focused on working with our teams to strengthen quality across our operations,” Boeing said in a statement. “We believe there’s a path to a new contract that addresses the needs and concerns of our people while maintaining our ability to compete in the global market.”

**10-Year Grudge**

The tactics Boeing used a decade ago to wrest pension concessions and limit pay increases to less than 1% on average loom large over the coming negotiations — they were still in place when inflation soared post-Covid. 

“There’s no loyalty because Boeing wasn’t particularly loyal,” said analyst Richard Aboulafia. “Now the labor markets have shifted radically, and they may stay that way for a long time.”

Back then, the aviation titan held crucial leverage over its Seattle-area workforce: a hulking new jet program known as the 777X. The company’s commitment to its century-old base was in question after Boeing had begun assembling 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina a year earlier. 

To force the IAM into contract talks that included freezing pensions, Boeing threatened to take the 777X program out of the Seattle area, inviting states around the US to compete for the factory. 

While local IAM leaders saw a bluff, senior union staff in Washington, DC, took over the talks and backed down. The narrowly approved deal that resulted preserved jobs, but the fixed-pension plan was ended, and pay raises totaled 4% over the next decade. 

“The anger that was experienced by our membership throughout that process in 2013 and 2014 is certainly palpable today,” Holden said. “I hear it any time I’m in the factory, and from all across the spectrum.”

As it prepares for the coming talks, Boeing doesn’t have a new plane to use as a bargaining chip, and with unemployment rates near record lows, it can’t threaten to shift manufacturing to the South. The company can ill-afford a work stoppage as it tries to steady its factories and suppliers, and return output to a steady, reliable pace. 

The union holds the upper hand, said Ken Herbert, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “If there’s really a time to strike a deal that works for them, it’s now,” he said. “They’re going to be very, very aggressive.”

Boeing last week declined to give a financial outlook for this year, though it held to a target of generating free cash flow of $10 billion in 2025 or 2026, a goal at risk of being trashed by a prolonged work stoppage.

A labor deal could also be costly. Every 10% increase in machinist wages will drag down 2026 free cash flow by an estimated $260 million before price and productivity offsets, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst with Jefferies.

There’s further uncertainty with US regulators digging deeper into Boeing’s quality practices after the structural blowout on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on Jan. 5. Its suppliers, who are gathered in the Seattle area this week, must also weigh whether to risk a continued ramp-up of production.  

The machinists intend to use their leverage to push for more than the usual economic concessions. Holden wants Boeing to reinstate thousands of quality inspections it suspended last decade. And he plans to press executives to commit to making planes in Seattle for decades. 

Boeing says it restored the inspections, and has increased the number of quality inspectors in its commercial division by 20% since 2019.

The union also plans to press for the return of defined-benefit pensions, lower out-of-pocket health costs and more flexibility around overtime. The IAM local has been studying the tactics employed last year by the United Auto Workers, including striking at selective locations, Holden said.

“We need jobs for 50 years, not four years,” Holden said.

There’s a link between Boeing’s labor pains and the quality lapses that prompted US regulators and airline customers to send auditors into the planemaker’s factories after the Alaska Airlines accident, said Cliff Collier, a consultant with decades of aerospace manufacturing experience. 

Boeing’s recent struggles are rooted in turnover, he said: an influx of inexperienced workers and managers since the pandemic, and labor tactics that led to an earlier exodus of seasoned staff, Collier said.

“People don’t get stupider,” Collier said. “People get overworked, people get pushed to do things they probably shouldn’t do.”",2024-02-06 14:29:14,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221618,23 days 01:00:32.221618,229,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1akb16h/boeings_next_crisis_aerospace_workers_demanding/

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I am fine to save $1000 per month and invest in the etf, but in the past ten years, the price has surged from $168.88 to $452.62. And maybe after 15 years from now, the price will reach the threshold of $1000. By that time, I am afraid it will be too expensive for me to invest in. SPLG seems to be more affordable, but the market size is too small compared to likes, such as VOO, IVV and SPY, so it makes me feel insecure about it.

And then, another question. I understand the price of VOO follows the performance of S&P500 index, but still it’s traded by people worldwide, how come the price was so stable? If someone want to buy 1 million worth of the etf, why it won’t make the price volatile?

1ajssiu,stocks,Palantir stock jumps on revenue beat,"- Palantir reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Monday.

- The company’s revenue for the quarter increased 20% year over year to $608.4 million.

- In a letter to shareholders, Palantir CEO Alex Karp said demand for large language models in the U.S. “continues to be unrelenting.”

Here’s how the company did:

- Earnings per share: 8 cents adjusted vs. 8 cents expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

- Revenue: $608.4 million vs. $602.4 million expected by LSEG

Palantir’s revenue for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, increased 20% year over year to $608.4 million, up from $508.6 million a year earlier. The company reported a net income of $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share, in the year-ago quarter. In a letter to shareholders, Palantir CEO Alex Karp said the company’s expansion and growth “have never been greater,” especially as demand for large language models in the U.S. “continues to be unrelenting.” Palantir has been rolling out its Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP, and Karp said the company carried out nearly 600 pilots with the technology in 2023, up from fewer than 100 in 2022.

“Our results reflect both the strength of our software and the surging demand that we are seeing across industries and sectors for artificial intelligence platforms,” Karp wrote. Palantir said it expects to report between $612 million and $616 million in revenue during its first quarter, and it guided revenue for the full year between $2.65 billion and $2.67 billion. Wall Street was expecting $617 million during the first quarter and $2.66 billion in revenue for the full year.

Palantir, known for its defense and intelligence work with the U.S. government, said its U.S. commercial revenue grew 70% year over year. Palantir said its U.S. commercial customer count increased 55% year over year, growing from 143 customers to 221 customers. Last quarter, Palantir reported its fourth-straight quarter of profitability, which means it is now eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.

1ajlao9,stocks,"Estée Lauder stock soars toward best day in 13 years after earnings, job cuts",">Shares of Estée Lauder Companies soared Monday, after the beauty-products company reported fiscal second-quarter profit that beat expectations by a wide margin, despite continued challenges in the Asia market. The company EL, also announced an expansion of its profit-recovery plan, to include a restructuring program that will result in the cutting of 3% to 5% of its workforce. That could represent up to about 3,150 jobs.

>“We made progress in the first half across several strategic priorities, including reducing inventory in the trade of Asia travel retail, improving working capital, realizing higher levels of net pricing, and managing expenses with discipline,” said Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda. “We are, encouragingly, at an inflection point.” The stock ran up 15.3% toward a five-month high in premarket trading, which would put it on track for the biggest one-day gain since it rocketed 17.9% on Nov. 3, 2011.

>Net income for the quarter to Dec. 31 fell to $313 million, or 87 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents were well above the FactSet consensus of 54 cents. Sales declined 7.4% to $4.28 billion, reflecting challenges in Asia travel retail and softness in prestige beauty in China, but came in above the FactSet consensus of $4.19 billion. Among the company’s business segments, skin-care sales fell 10.5% to $2.17 billion, but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.95 billion. Makeup sales declined 7.6% to $1.17 billion, missing the FactSet consensus of $1.25 billion; fragrance sales edged up 0.4% to $737 million, but missed expectations of $789 million; and hair-care sales were down 5.5% to $173 million, missing expectations of $180 million.'

>Regarding the job cuts, the company said the workforce-reduction plan is based on the number of positions it had as of June 30, 2023. Based on the company’s disclosure that it had approximately 62,000 to 63,000 employees worldwide at that time, a 5% reduction would suggest 3,150 employees would lose their jobs. Estée Lauder said it expects to record charges of between $500 million and $700 million once the restructuring program is fully implemented, for severance, contract terminations and asset write-offs. Gross benefits of the program are expected to range between $350 million and $500 million. Including the new restructuring program, the company expects its Profit Recovery Plan to yield $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in operating profit.

1ajhnyc,stocks,McDonald’s revenue misses estimates as Middle East conflict weighs on quarterly sales,"Here’s what McDonald’s reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.95 adjusted vs. $2.82 expected

Revenue: $6.41 billion vs. $6.45 billion expected


The fast-food giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, up from $1.9 billion, or $2.59 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding the write-off of software that’s no longer in use, restructuring costs and other items, McDonald’s earned $2.95 per share.

Net sales rose 8% to $6.41 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales grew 3.4% in the quarter, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 4.7%, as its Middle Eastern sales struggled.

The international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales increase just 0.7%. McDonald’s said the division’s sales lagged as a result of the Israel-Hamas war.

McDonald’s has seen its Middle Eastern sales falter from boycotts after its Israeli licensee offered discounts for soldiers. The company has also had to shutter some locations temporarily to ensure employees’ safety from protests. Boycotts also dented Starbucks’ quarterly sales.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company is seeing sales in some markets outside the Middle East weaken as a result of the boycotts as well. He named Malaysia and Indonesia, both of which have majority Muslim populations. France, too, saw “some impact.”

“The Company is monitoring the evolving situation, which it expects to continue to have a negative impact on Systemwide sales and revenue as long as the war continues,” McDonald’s said in a regulatory filing.

All other markets in the segment, like China and Japan, reported positive same-store sales growth for the quarter.

Domestic same-store sales rose 4.3%, about in line with expectations, helped by menu price hikes. The company also credited effective marketing and digital sales growth.

In the third quarter, McDonald’s said its U.S. traffic fell as low-income consumers pulled back their spending. It was the first sign that diners were beginning to shy away from the chain’s higher prices. McDonald’s has also been rolling out an improved version of its burgers nationwide, as it tries to convince customers that its prices are worth it.

The company’s international operated markets segment, which includes Canada, Australia and Germany, reported same-store sales growth of 4.4%, shy of StreetAccount estimates of 5.1%. Same-store sales shrank in France, however.

“We’re not happy with our performance in France right now,” Kempczinski said.

Pricing backlash contributed to France’s weaker sales, he added.

For 2024, McDonald’s reiterated its forecast from December that new restaurants will increase its systemwide sales growth by nearly 2%, excluding currency changes. The chain plans to open more than 2,100 new locations this year as part of a broader strategy to accelerate its expansion and reach more customers.

The company also said it will spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year on capital expenditures. More than half of that money will go toward opening new restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets.

Snap shares were up around 1% in pre-market trading. The company has executed multiple rounds of layoffs since 2022, most recently in November, when it trimmed a small number of product employees.

1ajei4o,stocks,"Target Corporation, may be worth taking a look!","Target is a stock that has peaked my interest, especially with the S&P currently trading at a 20x multiple on 2025's earnings. As such, I have been looking to accumulate a position in the name, say, for a 12-18 month hold, while the company potentially turns the corner...Currently, I own about 300 shares at an avg. price of $144.59.

Fundamentally, the company looks to be turning a corner (as most of us know the product mix that they have had for the past 12-18 months has been disastrous, which is why the stock has been pounded from ATH to what it is today). That being said, the company is still on track to hit the $8.00-$8.50 EPS in Fiscal 2024 and, while inventory in the last quarter, seemingly, hit what the company calls the ""top"", I think that there may be room for the company to run in conjunction with the economy staying strong and with a few cuts from the FEDS in the back half of this current year, thereby, at least conceptually, keeping the already relatively strong consumer, stronger.

The company boasts about $2 billion dollars of cash on hand, versus long term debt of about $16 billion (equating to about $400 million of interest expense every quarter) coupled with projected annual net cash flow of about $3.4-$3.67 billion in FY 2024.

In my view, the key is going to be revenue growth, which could lead to a higher premium to that of the investor benchmark (The S&P 500), which I believe looks achievable with the ""reset"" the company had two-four quarters ago. Therefore, while I am not necessarily a big individual stock investor (as most of my posts are buy the SPY and FLY, as, empirically, it is the safest and sounded way to invest), in looking at this one over the past few weeks, I am of the belief that, assuming EPS hits $8.20 per share at a 20x multiple this year, that would put fair value of shares @ $164.00 versus the current price of $145.49 as we sit here today (that equates to about an 11.2% gain). I should note that the company also pays a safe dividend of $4.40 per share / 3.2% / $1.931 billion.

Further, as we have seen with the likes of other big names that have been undervalued and are of quality, when these names start to run, the FOMO and ""computers"" seem to buy, pushing valuations even higher and, again, in looking at this quality name, I am of the belief that the same thing may be in the process of happening here.

Curious to get the communities feedback on this one and thank you, ahead of time, for reading my commentary.",2024-02-05 11:38:41,2024-02-29 15:29:46.221679,24 days 03:51:05.221680,74,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ajei4o/target_corporation_may_be_worth_taking_a_look/

1aiol8j,stocks,Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis,"***Note: Not Financial Advice***

# Introduction:

NFLX prices dropped to their 5Y lowest in 2022 when they announced their first quarter in years when the number of subscribers had fallen. This was accompanied by other media companies dipping their toes into streaming services for the first time. It seemed that investors believed the golden era of NFLX dominance was over. However, NFLX made certain changes such as paid-sharing and ad-tier making radical changes to adapt to the situation on the ground quickly. The recent release of earnings results displays that NFLX's efforts are paying off and NFLX has solidified its position in being the leader to capture the streaming market.

# Revenue:

Beyond paid sharing and ad-tier subscription, how NFLX sees its revenue and subscribers growing is through improving the value of their offering. They want to offer diversity (Live Entertainment like WWE). NFLX has also begun receiving some of their competitors' content as NFLX is the only one with sufficient reach to deliver the full value of the IP e.g. HBO’s Suits. NFLX broadcasted it and revived Suits. Streaming services like HBO Max ([SOURCE](https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/removed-hbo-max-movies-shows-warner-bros-discovery-merger-list/)) and Disney, are removing shows (Band of Brothers, How I met your Mother) and licensing them to NFLX to avoid paying residuals. NFLX can scoop these shows up as they have sufficient reach to truly utilize the value of the IPs that were removed.

I assumed that the revenue per subscriber from both ad-tier and non ad-tier is the same, the difference in sales price is made up by the revenue from advertisers. So both ad-tier and non ad-tier subscribers are lumped together in my forecast.

The churn rate was taken from ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-wins-streaming-wars-this-chart-shows-why-2024-1#:~:text=This%20data%20comes%20to%20us,customers%20are%20with%20the%20product)). I assumed that it took another 4 years for the churn rate to tick back down, the churn rate is slightly higher for consumers that are either still trying out ad-tier or are affected by paid-sharing. To avoid being overly granular when making assumptions about consumer's consumption habits, I assumed that the perpetual churn rate remained constant at historic amounts.

When forecasting the number of subscribers, opting for less granularity I forecasted subscribers as a whole without distinction for whether they are old or new subscribers and the churn rate applies to all subscribers as a whole.

The growth in subscribers is fueled by better content offerings, the streaming services market getting more efficient, and marketing. As NFLX continues offering more exclusive high-quality content, this incentivizes people to subscribe to NFLX. This is further fueled by certain competitor selling their IPs to NFLX due to the cost of these shows (Residuals) being higher than the benefit of these shows. As NFLX continues improving its strong branding, it will eventually build a strong enough reputation as a contender for being on consumer’s TV when streaming services completely overtake Linear Networks.

“our engagement is a bit impacted by our paid sharing. Think about it like fewer households using the same account. So, as those folks spin off and get their own accounts and we win them over with our programming, that will normalize and continue to grow.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference.

I assumed that in the first 3 years of my forecast, the rate of subscriber increase tended higher before tapering back down and then a slight increase in rate due to the streaming and liner network market getting more efficient.

When forecasting Annual Revenue/Subscriber, as NFLX's main underserved markets lie in Asia and other less wealthy countries and management sees paid-sharing as a sort of quasi-price increase, I’d assumed that prices increase at a slow rate before increasing at the perpetual inflation rate.

# 

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, COGS mainly consists of the amortization of acquired content. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages as I assumed that management continues their current pace of spending.

When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing would remain constant for the first half of my forecast before tapering downwards slightly as NFLX gains a strong brand so there is less need for advertising.

When forecasting R&D and G&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.03%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) = 1.28

Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.92%

NFLX is rated “BBB” ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2433501/))

BBB Bond yield = 5.41%

Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%

AT-COD = 4.27%

Stock Price (5D Avg) = $566.24

Shares O/S = 432.76M

Market Value of Equity = 245046.02M

Weighted Average Maturity of debt = 4 Years.

FY23 Interest Expense = 699.83M

Market Value of Debt = 14882.36M

%Debt = 5.73%

%Equity = 94.27%

%WACC = 9.60%

# CapEX, D&A and Content Acquisiton:

When forecasting CapEX and D&A, opting for less granularity I assumed it as a % of historic averages.  


When forecasting Content Acquisition, as management has stated that they intent on spending 17B on content acquisition for FY24, so I forecasted FY24 as such. For the high growth period, I assume that NFLX has to keep up content acquisition in line with historic in order to keep remaining attractive to new subscribers. Beyond the high growth period, I assumed that NFLX will get more capital efficient and reinvest negative amounts given that the streaming market is now significantly more efficient and there is less need to constantly feed money into content acquisition endlessly. 

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in base case I value NFLX at $371.71 per share. NFLX's nearest competitor Disney is having troubles focusing solely on streaming due to the major restructuring of their core business operations that has to be done, which may cannibalise or hinder their progress. I believe that NFLX's intrinsic value could be significantly be higher due to their dominant position in the streaming market. However, in order to forecast NFLX nearer to its current market price at about $560 would require making very bold assumptions such as the fall of a few streaming services that leads to mass migration of subscribers into NFLX or the accelerated decline of Linear Network.

1ai8r1o,stocks,Interest Rate Resistant Sector Specific Inflation,"Is the market still pricing in rate cuts as stocks go to record highs? 

Are non stock comp workers primed to demand pay increases, as their companies pull in massive profits, and as personal costs continue to heighten? 

As stock comped workers continue to accrue more wealth, and lower class continues to take on debt (inc. non forgivable student debt), has there ever been more of a pronounced have and have-not gap?

Will large companies continue to dominate their industry space? Has industry ever been as consolidated as it is today? How many wealthy people do you hear about working for smaller companies? How many smaller companies are left with acquisition and consolidation happening all the time?

Are raised interest rates having any effect on aforementioned large, industry consolidated companies with huge profit margins? As when you own a large slice of the market for essential goods, you can simply raise prices, and they will be paid. Biden admin recently addressed this for the grocery corps. But grocery, shipping, and producers have heavily consolidated in recent years, as have most industries.

With the recent progress of tech, there is big efficiencies gained by industry consolidation. See amazon. But those industries also attain market, employment and regulatory control with their resources. And jobs continue to be ""de-skilled"" by efficiency and automation, which is used as a reason to keep pay low. 

I'm not sure what this all means for the economy or the market. I've been telling everyone for years that it's a strange but incredibly bustling time for US hegemony in the world. I should have believed my own thought in terms of the market. But I tend to skew overly pragmatic. 

I did pretty well recently, as my 200 share short @ 230 on Tesla finally started to pay off. It seems like the AI hype is a ticking time bomb. But tech companies like meta are making so much money they can throw billions into speculation plays without a worry. They seem to actually have no choice but to do this.

Where do things go from here?

So I’m in uni and I have an equity research internship

I’ve really struggled with meeting the quota of 2 valuations a day (about 4 hours per valuation).

2) research the operations / business model

3) understand the companies financial position well, including the historical context for fluctuations in revenue growth, margins, etc

4) model all of that out and predict the future

5) write a 20 page report with every single claim backed up with proof. Proving is the most difficult part…seriously, if I were to state the sky is blue, I’m expected to collect empirical data on it and present it or else I’m assumed to be wrong lol.

1ahx1og,stocks,Reddit picks New York Stock Exchange for delayed IPO,">Reddit is planning an initial public offering and the New York Stock Exchange won the listing, the Wall Street Journal has reported. The San Francisco-based social media company confidentially filed offering paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, it had said in a blog post back then. However, plans were put on hold amid a challenging business climate and aligning with the broader trend of delayed IPOs in the tech sector. It is expected to unveil the filing as soon as later this month and will name NYSE as its exchange, according to the WSJ report. The listing is a coup for the NYSE in its competition with Nasdaq for high-profile IPOs.

>In 2023, the number of IPOs on US exchanges annually increased by 42 per cent, but IPO proceeds grew by more than 160 per cent, driven by several large high-profile listings, an EY report said in January. There were seven IPOs in 2023, which raised more than $500 million, compared with only four in 2022, it added. Technology and health care continued to lead the US IPO deal count. Across sectors, investor preferences have continued to gravitate towards companies with greater scale and profitability, EY reported. “The market backdrop for IPOs has improved significantly over the past few quarters: valuations are up, volatility is down, inflation may be corralled, and interest rates could begin ticking down,” the consultancy said.

>Reddit is considering feedback from early meetings with potential investors in its IPO that it should consider a valuation of at least $5 billion, Bloomberg reported. The online discussion platform has been looking to capitalise on the attention it gained when its WallStreetBets forum became a hot spot for individual investors who rallied around GameStop and other stocks. Founded in 2005, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion from private investors so far, including support from Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Fidelity led Reddit’s Series F raise in 2021, at a valuation close to $10 billion, although it later marked down the value of its holdings in the company by 41 per cent. The company could potentially have been valued as much as $15 billion in an IPO then, Bloomberg reported in 2022. Steve Huffman, chief executive and co-founder of Reddit, acknowledged in a discussion with users last year that the company had stalled its IPO plans to move closer to profitability. Reddit had more than 70 million daily active unique visitors as of October, according to its website. It became a darling of the so-called meme-stock era after a forum on the site, WallStreetBets, jolted the stock market.

1ahaja2,stocks,How does stock lending work?,"So I have a pretty basic understanding of stock lending, I understand why people borrow stocks and what they do with the capital once they get it. But the main thing I don't understand is the risks for the lender. Currently I'm trading just using Wealth Simple, and they didn't really list or explain the risks of lending and it just seems too good to be true.

1ah690d,stocks,Sell or stay,"I received a pretty substantial amount of RSU’s from my company awhile back. They’re currently valued at around 12k. Now around 6 months ago there was news about a potential buy out from a private equity. I’m currently getting no dividends from the stock and it’s about 1/4 of my portfolio. 

So I’m trying to understand if I should sell it and just put it into SPY/VOO for a better return or wait to see if the buyout actually happens. 

If anyone knowledgeable about buyouts and how much that can drive the price up could chime in that would be appreciated. There’s also the aspect of the buyout never happening and the stock staying flat.

1ah5e9g,stocks,DDS market cap bigger than M or KSS+JWN. Reasonable?,"Ever since the Covid recovery days, DDS has skyrocketed some 1000 %. Meanwhile, M has recovered fully but no more than that while KSS and JWN are pretty much still as beaten down as during the initial Covid stock market crash.

I know DDS is a financially much healthier company than the others and that the owners have put a lot more money into the company with buybacks etc. 

I also know KSS, JWN and M all have a lot of debt. 

Even so, isn’t it kind of mind boggling that DDS has a bigger market cap than M and that DDS is bigger than JWN and KSS put together? I feel like that’s crazy. It makes sense in a narrow span of time but I think 5 years from now either DDS’ market cap will be way smaller or the other three will be much bigger. In other words, I suspect this extremity of difference will slow down in time. 

What do you think? In time, will Dillard’s be the biggest department store in America and Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom will all be going away? Or only some of them?

1ah1ift,stocks,Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.

Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.

Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.

Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.

In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.

We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.

AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.",2024-02-02 11:25:46,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153133,27 days 04:04:01.153133,196,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1agtkhe,stocks,Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‘later this year’,"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.

While Cook’s remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.

“As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,” Cook said during a call with analysts. “That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”

Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer’s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase “artificial intelligence” during the presentation, preferring the more academic term “machine learning.”

“Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,” Cook said.

1agmyb1,stocks,Mag7 vs Mag7 ETF,"Hey guys! 

So I had some money that I wanted to invest equally in the Mag7 stocks. I just heard today that they came out with a Mag7 ETF. After reading some articles, I saw it said “the portfolio will be reallocated on a monthly basis to ensure an equal weighting of each of the seven YieldMax ETFs within the Fund's holdings”

I’m just curious 1) what that means exactly, 2) is that a benefit or a bad thing, and 3) whether the ETF or individually owning each stock is better

1agm286,stocks,"Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, or close to 2% of its workforce","Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, CNBC confirmed on Thursday, the latest tech company to slash headcount this year as investors continue to push for efficiency.

A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the company’s workforce.

“We regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy,” the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. “As part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.”

Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.

The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.

As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.

Last month, Microsoft
 cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google
 said it’s eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon
 laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.

In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta
 announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it’s laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.

Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom’s stock has stumbled.

Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.

Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the “uncertainty of the global economy,” CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.

Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

1agem31,stocks,2024 One Month Reflection,"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts.  Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps.  Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022.

Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march.  That is when we started to see another selloff.  Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate. 

There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping.  Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict.  As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue.  

Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far.  SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom.  AMD's Lisa SU said,“We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history”  Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue.

Based on this information the broader market should start to  do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting.  There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed.  I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk.  Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy.   Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle.  This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology.  Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks.

1agc3ms,stocks,M&A Analysis: Silver Lake Acquisition of Qualtrics,"# Introduction:

Silver Lake acquired Qualtrics in an all-cash deal at a Transaction Enterprise Value of $12.5 billion or $18.15 per share. 

Qualtrics is an experience management software for both customers and employees.

employeeXM, Qualtrics helps administer digital surveys for employees. Collecting the data and creating easy ways to visualize it. They are especially useful for larger companies with larger data sets, using AI and deep learning to quickly aggregate the data into a few overarching themes.  


customerXM, Qualtrics helps administer qualitative surveys for digital customers. They are the VOC (Voice of Customers) allowing more open-ended questions and then Qualtrics uses text recognition to analyze the responses.

I did a DCF to quantify the potential gains for Silver Lake.

# Deal Rationale:

My belief of the deal rationale for Silver Lake is the large use of SBC by Qualtrics.  
41% of Qualtric's total cost was in equity or SBC. When a company is private, employees tend not to exercise options as the stock is illiquid so they would either sell back SBC or hold onto their stock options, so SBC is essentially a non-cash expense for Qualtrics.

&#x200B;

# Revenue:

When forecasting the number of customers, I got my numbers from the respective year’s 10-K. Given the large switching cost of porting data over and retraining employees to use a competitor’s XM software. I believe this allows Qualtrics to hold onto customers more easily and given the large number of distinguished customers that do use Qualtrics, it adds to Qualtrics’ credibility helping to fuel the growth of Qualtrics. Given the improving macro factors, it catalyzes the growth for Qualtrics as firms begin growing, they need to process larger data sets of surveys from both customers and employees to effectively provide their goods and services. I assumed that the macro environment would take 2 years to clear up from 2022.  
  
When forecasting Annual Revenue/Customer, I assumed that the newer customers are committing to a lower-price, short-duration package so the Y/Y growth rate of Annual Revenue/Customers reduces during the period where there is larger customer growth.  
  
When forecasting Professional Services and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic average.  


# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic average.  
  
When forecasting R&D, G&A, and Sales, I assume that Silver Lake wants to exit the investment within 5 years and will cut down R&D and headcount to a minimum.  
  
When forecasting Marketing, I believe marketing spend will decrease over time as the switching cost over to a competitor is high and Qualtrics becomes more well-known so there is less need to advertise Qualtrics.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.00%  
US ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/xm/statistics/)) = 1.73  
COE = 11.96%  
  
Qualtrics is rated “B+” ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-assigns-qualtrics-international-inc-first-time-b-idr-outlook-stable-10-04-2023#:~:text=First-Time%20%27B%2B%27%20IDR%3B%20Outlook%20Stable,-Mon%2010%20Apr&text=Fitch%20Ratings%20-%20Chicago%20-%2010%20Apr,The%20Rating%20Outlook%20is%20Stable))  
COD (1M Avg) = 7.60%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 6.00%  
  
Given that Qualtrics is a private company, there is no available data for recent market prices. So I opted to use the book value of equity and liability when calculating weightage.  
  
BV Equity = 1904.02M  
BV Liability = 278.18M  
%Liability = 12.75%  
%Equity = 87.25%  
WACC = 11.20%   


# CapEX,D&A and SBC:

When forecasting CapEX, D&A and SBC opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of Historic average. 

# Conclusion:

Utimately, in my base case, I value Qualtrics at $25.43 per share. This would represent a 40.1% profit on Silver Lake's investment or Y/Y CAGR of 7.0%.

In my best case, I value Qualtrics at $30.07 per share. This would represent a 65.7% profit on Silver Lake's investment or Y/Y CAGR of 10.6%.

This means that Qualtrics would be an above-average investment when compared to the average private equity investment returns ([SOURCE](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-do-returns-private-equity-investments-compare-returns-other-types-investments.asp#:~:text=Private%20equity%20produced%20average%20annual,returns%20can%20be%20less%20impressive)), Silver Lake recognised the hidden value of Qualtrics. They saw the strong USP of Qualtrics and their high C.A. from the high switching cost to a competitor.

1ag99mu,stocks,Talk me out of loading up on WOLF,"For any SiC experts out there (I am not one)—it feels to me like WOLF is being taken to the woodshed for no good reason. They are massively, and it sounds like successfully, expanding production of SiC materials and devices. Gross margins on materials products seem to be quite good, and the entire SiC industry seems supply constrained at the moment. Yeah, EV production may slow momentarily, but does anyone really doubt the long term trend? I also find it likely that as SiC supply grows and costs come down with the sort of scale Wolfspeed is aiming for, there will be more and more SiC uses found/justified. Translation, TAM for SiC products is massively going up and to the right.

So we have a $4B market cap, well funded company ($2B in deposits from customers, plenty of cash on hand to fund manufacturing expansions, applying for gov funding from CHIPs act now) with proven track record demonstrating success in new 200MM boule height material manufacturing. Wolf is trading at ~4x revenue with near term plans to 4x (and then easily get to 10x) manufacturing capacity. No one said building out manufacturing is easy, but with each passing quarter they demonstrate more and more success on this front. The unique scale they are chasing should make them cost competitive with virtually anyone, and as the US focuses on near-shoring/onshoring critical infrastructure manufacturing, their competitive edge should only solidify.

1afxwfr,stocks,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",2024-02-01 00:45:47,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153239,28 days 14:44:00.153239,151,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1afxwfr/two_big_differences_between_amd_nvda/
1afvzo6,stocks,Is Starbucks in trouble?,"**TLDR**: Most sources are aligned on boycotts having an impact on SBUX performance, some focusing on it more/less than others/attributing performance to other things. The real question is how long do we think the boycotts will last and does it make SBUX a bad investment medium term?  
**Sky News** reports boycotts being a contributing factor to its sales forecast being cut:

* Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations
* The business was hit by staff walkouts and a dropping number of US occasional visitors
* Significant impact on traffic and sales in the Middle East due to the Israel-Hamas conflict
* Boycotts of the chain took place in the US
* Starbucks took legal action against Workers United for using its name and similar logo
* Protesters influenced by misrepresentation on social media
* Record revenue of $9.43bn was reported in its first 2024 fiscal quarter
* Sales outlook for the rest of the year was lowered as spending weakened in China and other markets

Had a quick scan on **NewsCord** to see what other publishers are saying and understand the longer-term impacts of boycotting on $SBUX:

* **RTE.ie** mentions that shares rose 4% after the bell, while Sky News reports that Starbucks cut its yearly sales forecasts and missed market expectations, indicating a more negative tone in the Sky News report
* **Quartz** portrays a different narrative by focusing on Starbucks reporting record revenue and lowering its sales outlook, while Sky News emphasizes the impact of staff walkouts, dropping number of US occasional visitors, and the Israel-Hamas conflict
* **MarketWatch**: Boycotts related to an ‘erroneous’ interpretation of SBUX’s stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame.
* **MarketWatch**: Customers and others on social media have called for a boycott against Starbucks after the union representing some employees at the chain expressed solidarity with Palestine
* **MarketWatch** mentions that boycotts related to an ‘erroneous’ interpretation of SBUX’s stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were to blame, whereas Finbold does not cover this specific reason for the boycotts",2024-01-31 23:21:14,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153243,28 days 16:08:33.153243,123,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1afvzo6/is_starbucks_in_trouble/

1afq3pa,stocks,"After hours trading feel unfair from my perspective, what I don't know?","
Let's take into consideration this scenario:

Company ""A"" has current price 105 USD.

I'm setting ""Sell Stop"" at 100 USD and there's plenty of buys/sells around this level - below and above (I think)

And now, the market is closed, price is still 105 USD and there's earnings release.

Earnings went terribly and after hours stock drops to 70 USD.

During this time I'm unable to modify or cancel my ""Sell Stop"" position (I'm using X-Trade Brokers - they're almost biggest in my country)

And now, the market opens at the next day and it starts from around 70 USD (it feels like there's small correction, but still there's huge gap)

And I don't understand why it works like this. 

I mean it feels unfair to me because if there was no artifical concept of closing market then my mechanism would trigger around 100 USD.

But the second unfair thing is that other actors can trade meanwhile I cannot cancel/modify my ""Sell Stop"" action (or maybe my broker sucks?)


Also I don't understand where my ""Sell Stop"" is registered

Is it just at my broker or the actual stock exchange?

I guess it is actual stock exchange because I'm unable to cancel this during off-hours, but on the other hand
if that was actual stock exchange, then why it doesn't trigger closer to 100 USD?

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.* ***The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.*** *In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

McGrath RentCorp stock was climbing Monday as mobile storage company WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings agreed to acquire the business rental company in a $3.8 billion deal.

The 60% stock and 40% cash transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, the companies said in press release, subject to the approval of McGrath shareholders. When the deal is closed, McGrath stock holders will receive for each of their shares either $123 in cash or 2.8211 shares of WillScot Mobile Mini common stock.

“This combination provides McGrath customers and employees a platform for continued growth and success, while providing McGrath shareholders with immediate cash value as well as participation in the upside potential of the combined company,” McGrath Chief Executive Joseph Hanna said.

WillScot Mobile expects the combined company will generate around $700 million in annual free cash flow by the end of the first full year following closing.

The deal represents a 10.1% premium to McGrath’s closing price on Friday. Shares of McGrath were rising 10% Monday to $123.20, which would be a new closing high for the stock and its largest percentage increase since October 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said it expects sales growth this year of between 18% and 26% in CER terms, as demand surges for Wegovy and Ozempic, which contain the same active ingredient.

The company’s shares climbed by around 3.7% early on Wednesday morning to notch a new all-time high and take its market cap above $500 billion, before cooling slightly. The stock was up by 1.6% on the day at 9 a.m. London time.

The 2023 results were fueled by strong performance in the company’s diabetes and obesity care division, with obesity care in particular spiking by 154% at CER to 41.6 billion.

“The unmet needs in type 2 diabetes and obesity are growing by the day, and the rising prevalence of these closely related threats to global health has created surging demand for our GLP-1-based therapies,” Chairman Helge Lund and CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in the earnings report.

“This has enabled us to reach more patients than at any point in our 100-year history, contributing to strong sales growth across North America and International Operations.”

The company also acknowledged that this had resulted in increased pressure on its supply chain, leading to “periodic constraints” across its portfolio as it struggled to keep pace with demand in 2023.

“We have responded by investing heavily in expanding our production capacity with the aim of serving millions more patients worldwide. In 2023 alone, we announced investments totalling more than DKK 75 billion in the expansion of our production sites across the globe,” the chairman and CEO said.

“With construction now underway on these projects, we strive to operate our existing facilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as we produce more of our life-changing medicines than ever before.”

Novo Nordisk said it had now begun to gradually increase supply of lower dosage Wegovy in the U.S., having restricted supply of the lower dose strength since last May.

1af8i7x,stocks,Thoughts on $LULU Lululemon Athletica,"its a company that specialises in sports and athleisure apparel from north america. Personally i think its a buy (not financial advice).  
Business model/revenue sources: they have 3 main revenue sources: direct-to-consumer (e-commerce), company operated stores, and services. Services means their other ventures like pop up stores, recommerce (selling 2nd hand lulu products) or factory outlet stores.  
Main reason i think this company is a buy rn is that i believe the streets are underestimating its product innovation. many equity researchers have calculated their new stores opening and increase in in-store sales numbers. but many has estimated new products very conservatively. men’s wear and especially sneakers market will drive stronger growth than many expect. the footwear market which Statista has estimated a total addressable market of about $100b worldwide, Nike alone holds about 25-30% of market share. Lululemon which is about 1/3 the size of nike, currently holds less than 1%. It would be easy to argue that this revenue source could increase to at least 3% of market share given its popularity based on amazon and google search trends.

Risk is that its priced very high, but i think the constant store openings will definitely hold up. 

Growth in China and europe are picking up too.

1af7k5c,stocks,Sam Altman should’ve been CEO of Google,"Hear me out, I want to make a bigger point. We read all the time about startups having been founded by former Google employees. Seems like so often you hear about startup so and so being founded by former Google employees, or same employees leaving to fund a startup. It gets you thinking. How can Alphabet display such lack of clarity in their vision, lack of speed, attention, and focus in their other bets (I.e. waymo)? 

How can Alphabet lack a gifted visionary when clearly there are so many there?

Is most of this talent locked out of leadership positions? And I get it. Not every talented employee can be CEO, or run every important business. But shouldn’t they have a real path to lead and run those positions and the brightest of them win? 

I look at what’s there, and hear the current CEO, and he seems like a very nice guy, honestly, he does. I just don’t hear someone with a clear vision for growth, or excitement about how he wants to shape the future and contribute to humanity. 

I also look at their Google Cloud ceo, and I walk away unimpressed. The CFO? She may be nice, but I just don’t see execution in streamlining operations to reach the same efficiency of Apple let’s say. And Apple has to run a much more complex operation spanning hundreds of suppliers, perhaps thousands, yet they do it. 

Now leadership is talking about finding outside investors for their other bets businesses, what is supposed to be the innovation lab, chasing moonshots. Why seek outside investors? Do they not see any promise in any of their own startups to not invest more of the $100 billion plus in cash they hold? Strange.

1af3n2d,stocks,Two IPOs I'm gonna be watching for in 2024,"I literally never post on /r/stocks and always lurk, so I wanted to contribute a little, with two IPOs that I'll be watching for in 2024. 

First; **Discord**, we all know it. But for the boomers, they launched in 2015 and has emerged as a dynamic digital communication hub, acclaimed for its comprehensive text, voice, and video chat features. Originally a favourite among gaming enthusiasts, its intuitive design and extensive functionalities have drawn a broad spectrum of online groups. This platform offers the creation and participation in servers with channels dedicated to specific topics, promoting a tailored space for interaction and teamwork. Notably, Discord's user-friendly interface, commitment to privacy and security, and seamless integration with various services have positioned it as a standout choice in online communication, extending its reach far beyond the gaming community.

> Why Discord Is a Prime IPO in 2024?

Investor excitement is mounting for Discord's IPO in 2024, driven by several key attributes. Primarily, Discord's successful transition from a gaming-centric platform to a versatile hub for various online communities highlights its vast growth potential. Its approachable interface and comprehensive communication tools, including text, voice, and video chat, have helped broaden its user base, fueling rapid expansion and a stronger market foothold.

Additionally, Discord's responsiveness to user preferences and ongoing innovation in platform enhancement resonate with the dynamic nature of digital communication. This positions the company favourably in a competitive and swiftly evolving market. Its emphasis on user privacy and security further enhances its attractiveness, particularly in today's climate where data protection is crucial.

From a financial standpoint, Discord demonstrates promising signs of a sustainable and scalable business model. The company's ability to attract and maintain a large, active user community opens doors for revenue growth, notably through premium subscriptions and strategic partnerships.

Therefore, I view Discord's IPO as an enticing investment avenue. Their strategic position in the digital communication realm, coupled with its potential for significant impact and leadership in the industry, bolsters investor enthusiasm for Discord's entrance into the public market in 2024.

Then there's **Turo**, founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Turo has revolutionized the concept of car rentals with its peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This innovative service allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through an accessible online and mobile interface. This unique model not only provides car owners with an avenue to earn additional income but also presents renters with a more diverse and often more affordable range of vehicle options compared to conventional rental services.

Turo prides itself on its user-friendly platform, streamlining the process of listing, searching, and booking vehicles. The platform excels in offering convenience, a wide variety of choices, and accessibility, catering to an array of needs and preferences. From economical cars for daily use to luxury and unique models for special occasions, Turo accommodates a broad spectrum of requirements.

Having significantly expanded its operations across multiple countries, Turo offers a diverse array of vehicles. The company has carved a niche in the sharing economy with its innovative approach to car rentals, focusing on enhancing user experience and combining the strengths of community and technology to transform the traditional car rental landscape. As a result, Turo has emerged as a frontrunner in the car-sharing domain, continually adapting to the evolving demands of contemporary consumers.

> Why Turo Is a Prime IPO in 2024?

Investor enthusiasm for Turo's IPO in 2024 is fueled by the company's trailblazing role in the car-sharing economy and its potential for future expansion. As a leading figure in peer-to-peer car rentals, Turo capitalizes on the burgeoning trend of the sharing economy. This differentiates it from traditional car rental firms and aligns with a consumer shift towards more flexible and economical transportation options.

Turo harnesses the untapped potential of privately owned vehicles, offering owners a novel way to monetize their assets. This approach has broadened the car rental market, providing users with a greater variety of vehicles and personalized rental experiences. Turo's emphasis on a seamless user experience and customer satisfaction has further solidified its position in the market.

Investors are optimistic about Turo's scalability and growing user base, indicating robust market demand. The company's upward growth trajectory and the increasing acceptance of peer-to-peer services point to a bright future. Turo's adeptness in navigating various regulatory landscapes and adapting to different market conditions underscores its operational agility and resilience.

Considering these aspects, Turo's IPO represents a compelling opportunity for investors to align with a pioneering entity in the transformation of traditional car rental services. Turo's successful exploitation of technology to innovate within the automotive and transportation sectors marks it as an attractive investment prospect in an evolving economic environment.

---

So both Discord and Turo present themselves as noteworthy IPOs to watch in 2024, each representing a significant shift in their respective industries. Discord, transcending its initial gaming roots, has evolved into a comprehensive digital communication platform with a wide-reaching influence. Its focus on user experience, privacy, and continuous innovation positions it as a strong contender in the digital communication sector. The company's scalable business model and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing digital landscape make it a compelling investment choice.

Turo, on the other hand, stands at the forefront of the car-sharing economy, redefining traditional car rental concepts with its peer-to-peer model. The company's growth trajectory, combined with its innovative approach and ability to meet diverse consumer needs, highlights its potential for long-term success in the evolving transportation sector. Turo's expansion and the increasing popularity of peer-to-peer services underscore its potential as a lucrative investment in the changing dynamics of the automotive industry.

For you guys, these two companies are a great example of the type of stuff we're looking for in an IPO, they are the kind of innovative, forward-thinking businesses that not only adapt to changing market demands but also lead the way in transforming their industries!",2024-01-31 00:03:04,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153327,29 days 15:26:43.153327,37,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1af3n2d/two_ipos_im_gonna_be_watching_for_in_2024/

1af1bgp,stocks,Walmart announces 3-for-1 stock split as shares hover below all-time high,"Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced that it will conduct a split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 3:1. The stock split is part of Walmart’s ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. More than 400,000 associates participate in Walmart’s Associate Stock Purchase Plan today, which allows eligible associates to buy stock conveniently through payroll deductions and provides a 15% company match on the first $1,800 each year.

“Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,” said Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart. “Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come. As Sam said, ‘We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.’”

For more than 60 years, Walmart has been focused on helping people save money and live better, including its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Walmart has focused on creating a path of opportunity for associates by offering good jobs and great careers, with continued investments in compensation, attractive healthcare, financial and educational benefits. As part of the benefits provided to its associates, Walmart has had an Associate Stock Purchase Plan for almost 30 years. Today’s stock split is just the latest action aimed at helping strengthen associates’ financial health.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share held. Walmart's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, under the company's existing trading symbol “WMT.” The stock split and final ratio were approved by Walmart's board.

The company expects that the stock split will increase the number of shares of Walmart’s outstanding common stock from approximately 2.7 billion shares to approximately 8.1 billion shares.

As a result of the stock split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of Walmart's common stock underlying the company's outstanding stock awards and warrants; the number of shares issuable under the company's equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable; the company’s common stock dividend; and the company’s authorized buyback programs. The company anticipates filing a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the effective date to report an amendment to the company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation effecting the stock split and reflecting a proportionate adjustment to the total number of authorized shares of company common stock.

GLAD appears to be paying out a monthly dividend since 2013, wouldn't that be a cheaper option than O? I'm guessing O is a safer choice, and that's why it would be best to go with O?

1af0cc0,stocks,AMD shares fall as first-quarter forecast comes in light,"Here’s how the company did versus LESG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus estimates for the quarter ended in December:

EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected

Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected


For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.

Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.

AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.

In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.

But historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.

Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.

However, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.

AMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

Sales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

1aezox1,stocks,Q1 Earnings - Starbucks earnings disappoint as sales outside the U.S. lag,"Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations as both domestic and international sales fell short of estimates.

CEO Laxman Narasimhan said in a statement that the chain faced “headwinds,” but the brand remains strong.

Shares initially fell in extended trading but recovered, rising about 2%.

Here’s what the company reported for its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 90 cents adjusted vs. 93 cents expected

Revenue: $9.4 billion vs. $9.59 billion expected


The coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, up from $855.2 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, Starbucks earned 90 cents per share.

Net sales rose 8% to $9.4 billion. Global same-store sales increased 5%, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 7.2%.

In North America, same-store sales also rose 5%, driven largely by customers spending more on their drinks and food.

Starbucks’ fiscal first quarter encompasses the all-important holiday season. The chain usually nets billions of dollars in gift card sales, plus higher traffic fueled by its seasonal drink offerings and thirsty shoppers.

Outside of Starbucks’ home market, the coffee chain reported international same-store sales growth of 7%, missing expectations of 13.2%.

China, the company’s second-largest market, reported same-store sales growth of 10%. However, the average ticket at its Chinese stores fell 9%.

The chain has seen increased competition from lower-priced rivals like Luckin Coffee, which have won over consumers as China’s economic recovery continues to lag.

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

I'm customizing a few index funds to keep out the stocks I don't like, and weigh more heavily the ones I am confident in. I know some brokerage platforms allow you to create a list of stocks and give each one a percentage for investing in the whole basket (like M1 or Fidelity), but that gets a bit difficult when you are dealing with dozens of stock picks. 

Does anyone know of a platform for easier direct indexing and re-balancing a basket of stocks without having to manually manage it on a separate excel sheet?",2024-01-30 19:09:03,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153368,29 days 20:20:44.153369,3,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aewh5u/easy_direct_indexing/

1. It's a venture capital darling with investment firms writing magazine style articles about them.

2. All info I could find was from either Fractyl Health management or their investors.

3. They were valued by VC firms at 100 million not long ago but are now trying to IPO at +800 million.

4. They have no FDA approved drug, they have FDA approval to test two drugs.

1aetxcu,stocks,Pfizer earnings report,"All,

Wondering what people here think about pfizer's latest quarterly report.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/pfizer-pfe-q4-earnings-report-2023.html

Earnings per share: 10 cents per share adjusted vs. loss of 22 cents expected
Revenue: $14.25 billion vs. $14.42 billion expected

Pfizer expects revenue to come in between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion this year, which includes roughly $8 billion in revenue from its Covid products and contributions from its recently closed acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen.

The company expects to book adjusted earnings of $2.05 to $2.25 per share.


2024 profits are expected to higher than 2023 profits with stagnanted revenues. Technically, without Seagen, revenues would have declined to about 53 billion. In terms of profitability, their cost cutting measures are expected to already take effect from this year itself.

And lastly, there's the ~6% dividend yield.",2024-01-30 17:27:08,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153376,29 days 22:02:39.153377,65,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aetxcu/pfizer_earnings_report/

1) going to their test stores to see what products they are trying out and seeing what’s selling then buying the stock of the companies.

And I notice that it’s flying off the shelves, so I look up who makes it and buy up stock in that company before it goes national.

2) satellite offices for venders often go up specifically to work with Walmart. Well, if they are opening up an office, maybe buy that too.

UPS fell short of Wall Street revenue estimates Tuesday, reporting drops in shipping volume, both internationally and domestically, in its fourth-quarter earnings report. The company also announced 12,000 layoffs as part of an effort to align resources in 2024.

The workforce reductions will save the company about $1 billion in costs, CEO Carol Tomé said on a company earnings call.


Shares of the package giant dipped nearly 6% in premarket trading.

Here’s how the company performed compared to Wall Street estimates:

Adjusted earnings: $2.47 vs. $2.46 per share expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv Revenue: $24.92 billion vs. $25.43 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, UPS reported net income of $1.61 billion, or $1.87 per share, compared with $3.45 billion, or $3.96 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items related to pensions and intangible assets, UPS earned $2.47 per share.

Revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion from $27 billion last year.

The company reported a 7.4% drop in average daily volume domestically and an 8.3% decrease internationally. UPS said the international decrease was primarily due to “softness in Europe.”

“2023 was a unique and difficult year and through it all we remained focused on controlling what we could control, stayed on strategy and strengthened our foundation for future growth,” Tomé said in a statement.",2024-01-30 14:04:50,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153384,30 days 01:24:57.153385,163,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aep66p/ups_announces_12000_job_cuts_says_package_volume/

1aemlp7,stocks,Vertex (VRTX) non-opioid drug shown to kill pain without addiction,"From the Wall Street Journal:

People who are suffering from severe pain but don't want to risk addiction to an opioid are closer to a new option for treatment.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday reported positive study results for its closely watched non-opioid painkiller. The drug lowered the moderate-to-severe acute pain reported by study volunteers, a sign it could be the first in a new class of painkiller to be approved for use.

But the experimental medicine is more likely to provide an alternative to opioids, rather than supplant them, because it didn't work better than a widely used opioid drug sold under the brand name Vicodin.

Vertex said it would file for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the middle of this year.

""If and when this medicine is approved, it will offer a new option for patients who need pain relief but who do not want to take an opioid,"" Vertex Chief Scientific Officer David Altshuler said in an interview.

Vertex released the results in a press release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. The company said the researchers who conducted the studies would publish their results in a journal later this year.

About 80 million Americans are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain each year, according to Vertex. They can choose from a variety of treatments. Many of them take opioids because they work so well.

Yet opioids are highly addictive, and their widespread use has fueled an epidemic of addiction and overdose deaths in the U.S.

To avoid addiction, many doctors, patients and health authorities have sought an alternative that provides as much relief from pain without creating the dependence on use.

Vertex's drug, code-named VX-548, belongs to a new class of medicines that targets molecular mechanisms involved in feeling pain. Researchers have pursued this so-called NaV class for years but experienced repeat setbacks.

NaV refers to the channels through which sodium flows in and out of cells. VX-548 blocks the flow of sodium through a channel called NaV1.8, which plays a role transmitting pain signals to the brain.

The drug, in other words, works by blocking or diminishing pain at the source before it heads to the brain and creates the feeling of pain.

Boston-based Vertex studied VX-548 in three late-stage, or Phase 3, trials that enrolled more than 2,400 subjects with conditions causing moderate-to-severe acute pain.

Two of the trials compared the efficacy of VX-548 against a placebo and Vicodin among subjects who either underwent a ""tummy tuck,"" or abdominoplasty, surgery or a bunion surgery.

The third study measured its efficacy among a range of surgical and nonsurgical acute pain issues .

Study subjects didn't show any serious adverse effects in the three studies, the company said.

Vertex is best known for its blockbuster cystic fibrosis treatments. The company received the first U.S. approval last month for a therapy that uses Crispr gene-editing technology; the drug, called Casgevy, treats people with sickle- cell disease.

VX-548 could open a new, potentially multibillion franchise in pain for the biotech company, Evercore ISI analyst Liisa Bayko said. ""It's a totally new class of drugs that have never made it this far,"" she said in an interview before the company released the trial results.

If approved, however, the drug will face heavy competition, including from low-price generics, according to analysts. To gain traction, Vertex will have to build experience and relationships in the market.

Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex's chief operating officer, said the company aims to sell this new class of medications across different pain types. Last month, the company released positive results for the drug reducing pain caused by diabetes-related nerve damage.

1aemd09,stocks,Does this stock research data exist?,"I compile some research myself for trading a portfolio of stocks and was wondering if anyone knows of a larger public source of it (covering more stocks than the ones I track)?

What I do is look at the breakdown of how a company (such as BP) makes its money from its last earnings report (BP mostly sells their own gas and fuel to customers in the uk and usa). Then I check to see how the costs and price it’s sold at changes to work out if the profit has jumped up or down (if fuel prices at the pump have jumped then I can work out roughly how much more profit BP has made). This gives me the edge of knowing if a stock is undersold or overbought and could jump when the new report is released.

I’m sure big trading firms with offices full of staff work this out for themselves BUT what I want to know is if there is a public source of this info I can use to cut down on the work I have to do. I would pay for a good source too if that was needed.

Thanks in advance for any advice or comments on what I am doing

Update: after speaking to a helpful person on this thread it looks like what I am doing is forming a “fair value” of a company based on changing market conditions.

1aduhbq,stocks,China Evergrande has been ordered to liquidate. The real estate giant owes over $300 billion,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong court ordered China Evergrande, the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, to undergo liquidation following a failed effort to restructure $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders that fueled fears about China’s rising debt burden.

“It would be a situation where the court says enough is enough,” Judge Linda Chan said Monday. She said it was appropriate for the court to order Evergrande to wind up its business given a “lack of progress on the part of the company putting forward a viable restructuring proposal” as well as Evergrande’s insolvency.

China Evergrande Group is among dozens of Chinese developers that have collapsed since 2020 under official pressure to rein in surging debt the ruling Communist Party views as a threat to China’s slowing economic growth.

But the crackdown on excess borrowing tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging on the economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China.

Chinese regulators have said the risks of global shockwaves from Evergrande’s failure can be contained. The court documents seen Monday showed Evergrande owes about $25.4 billion to foreign creditors. Its total assets of about $240 billion are dwarfed by its total liabilities.

“It is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,” the documents say.

About 90% of Evergrande’s business is in mainland China. Its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, was detained by authorities for suspected “illegal crimes” in late September, further complicating the company’s efforts to recover.

It’s unclear how the liquidation order will affect China’s financial system or Evergrande’s operations as it struggles to deliver housing that has been paid for but not yet handed over to families that put their life savings into such investments.

* Diversification Milestone with 40% of Fourth Quarter Adjusted Net Revenue from Tech Platform and Financial Services Segments
* For the full year 2024, management expects Tech Platform and Financial Services segments combined to grow at least 50% and lending revenue to be 92% to 95% of 2023 levels, and expenses under the EBITDA line to be flat when compared to 2023 results, excluding the reported goodwill impairment expense. This guidance anticipates an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% by year-end, which equates to a range of $580 to $590 million for the year. We anticipate that revenue from our Tech Platform and Financial Services segments, combined, will be approximately equal to revenue from our Lending segment for the year. That equates to full-year GAAP net income in the range of $95 to $105 million, or GAAP EPS of $0.07 to $0.08. We expect growth in tangible book value of $300 to $500 million for the year. In terms of Member growth, we expect at least 2.3 million new members during the full year 2024, which represents 30% growth.
* Looking beyond 2024 management expects 20% to 25% compound revenue growth for the time periods of 2023 through 2026, assuming no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions. This implies 50% compound growth for Financial Services revenue, mid-20% compound growth for Technology Platform revenue, and mid teens compound growth for Lending segment revenue. This is **expected to drive between $0.55 and $0.80 in GAAP earnings per share in 2026**. Moreover, we see 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026 reflecting both the continued growth of the core business growth plus the added benefit from new business lines launched in the 2024 to 2026 time period.

1adgztd,stocks,Tesla's Bull Case,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.

They will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.

So that is vehicle outlook for 2024.

&#x200B;

What about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.

They delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.

The Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.

Tesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.

They only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.

So while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.

What about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.

The IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.

So for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.

&#x200B;

I am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.

&#x200B;

Okay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.

&#x200B;

What about the future?

The TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.

&#x200B;

Lets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.  This is real, everyone is asleep right now and don't realize but this is happening.  They are going to be filling labor gaps initially, and eventually will be everywhere will Millions shipping.

&#x200B;

The economics for this type of product is hard to fathom, people do not understand and Tesla is the best positioned out of any company with their manufacturing capabilities, engineering, ai background and access to capital.

&#x200B;

So while I believe 2024 will be better than people realize thanks to stable margins from vehicles, acceleration of growth in energy, and a tam expansion coming in 2025 to lead the next wave of volume and eps growth, these things will pale in comparison to what this Bot represents and it is not priced in, nor is the next gen vehicle.

&#x200B;

Do your own DD, make your own decision, but I am ready for what is to come and will capitalize on it.

1adc5g0,stocks,Nick Timiraos - Plummeting Inflation Raises New Risk for Fed: Rising Real Interest Rates,">*Central bank feels pressure to cut interest rates as falling inflation raises real cost of borrowing*

https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/plummeting-inflation-raises-new-risk-for-fed-rising-real-interest-rates-fd2a4f37

Federal Reserve officials start the year with a problem they would ordinarily love to have: Inflation has fallen much faster than expected.

It does, nonetheless, pose a conundrum. The reason: If inflation has sustainably returned to the Fed’s 2% target, then real rates—nominal rates adjusted for inflation—have risen and might be restricting economic activity too much. This means the Fed needs to cut interest rates. The question is, when and by how much?  

The Fed won’t cut at its two-day meeting ending this Wednesday because the economy has been growing solidly. While inflation excluding food and energy on a monthly basis has been at or below 2% in six of the last seven months, the Fed wants to be sure that can be sustained before cutting rates.

Instead, Fed officials are likely to take a symbolically important step this week by no longer signaling in their policy statement that rates are more likely to rise than fall. Ditching this so-called tightening bias would affirm that officials are entertaining lower rates in the coming months.

Normally, the Fed cuts interest rates because economic activity is slowing sharply. Not this time: Growth remained surprisingly robust through the end of last year. Rather, they are mulling whether softening inflation means real interest rates will be unnecessarily restrictive if they don’t act.

Militating against a rate cut soon: Bond yields have fallen and stocks have risen, which could bolster economic activity and consumer spending. For that reason, officials could wait until May or even later to cut, said William English, a former senior Fed economist who is a professor at Yale School of Management.

On the other hand, “if they get genuinely reassuring inflation numbers and the real economy seems to be slowing a bit, I could see them getting comfortable with a cut in March,” he said.

**The case for cutting later**

Policymakers might want to move carefully to lower rates because they are not sure if the recent inflation cooling will last or if the economy will rev up in a way that sustains somewhat higher inflation. Several officials have said they want to avoid at all costs cutting rates only to have to raise them again.

Dean Maki, chief economist at hedge fund Point72 Asset Management, thinks the Fed will wait until June to cut interest rates because growth and hiring will exceed its expectations this year.

Concerns that lower inflation will raise real rates are misplaced because it will also boost purchasing power, consumer confidence and spending, said Maki. “Growth strengthens when inflation falls. I can’t think of examples in the last several decades where growth weakens after inflation falls,” he said.

It is also possible the economy can tolerate higher rates than before. In December, most officials thought the neutral rate, which balances supply and demand when the economy is operating at full strength, was 2.5%, well below the actual rate, which has been between 5.25% and 5.5% since July. That implies rates are highly restrictive, yet the economy hasn’t behaved that way.  

Officials “have tended to let the data tell them they’re overly restrictive rather than rely” on estimates of neutral, said Maki.

**The case for cutting sooner**

Others warn that waiting for the data to signal the Fed is too restrictive will require the type of aggressive cuts reserved for an economy falling into recession, as occurred in 2001 and 2007. They point to latent risks from heavily indebted companies, especially in real estate, which locked in lower interest rates earlier in the pandemic. Those borrowers might struggle as that debt is refinanced at higher rates.

The argument for lowering rates sooner goes like this: Fed officials raised rates rapidly to a 22-year high and telegraphed plans to keep them there for a while because they worried it would take years for inflation to fall back to their target. But inflation has fallen much faster than they expected. Prices excluding food and energy rose at a 1.9% annualized rate between July and December, down from 4% in the previous six-month period.

“We made a very aggressive tightening. Look not only at the supply that came back but also the demand that came down last year,” said Esther George, who served as president of the Kansas City Fed from 2011 until last year. There is potentially “a lot of room” to cut rates before they are in neutral territory again.  

Officials are also shrinking their $7.7 trillion asset portfolio—sometimes called “quantitative tightening” or QT—faster than they did five years ago. “They’ve got QT going on steroids, still,” said George.

Policymakers are right to worry that cutting rates then raising them again would blemish their credibility, said George. But she said the greater risk now is that taking too long to cut rates causes damage to the labor market that is hard to repair.

In November, for example, the hiring rate in the U.S. dropped to its lowest level in 10 years, a sign more companies might feel they are overstaffed. “The labor market is such a tricky one,” said George. Before a downturn, “it always looks like it’s not too bad, and then it goes south quickly.”

Officials raised rates because they worried high inflation would lead businesses and consumers to expect high prices to persist, creating a self-fulfilling cycle and a rerun of the 1970s. But it increasingly looks as if a series of shocks generated a one-off surge in prices across successive sectors—goods, housing, services and labor, said Dario Perkins, an economist at GlobalData TS Lombard in London. That gave the impression inflation’s increase was persistent when in fact it wasn’t. 

“You should be able to cut interest rates quite rapidly if that scary 1970s dynamic isn’t happening, and it isn’t happening,” he said. “The lesson of the last 12 months is that we don’t really need pain to get inflation down to tolerable levels.”",2024-01-28 20:26:23,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153468,31 days 19:03:24.153469,13,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adc5g0/nick_timiraos_plummeting_inflation_raises_new/
1ad8dys,stocks,Billionaire bond fund manager questions unemployment data: ‘Hard to believe’,"This is the NY Post so take with a grain of salt.

https://nypost.com/2024/01/27/lifestyle/billionaire-bond-fund-manager-jeffrey-gundlach-questions-unemployment-data-hard-to-believe/

I do NOT believe in conspiracy theories, but sometimes I think we assume one data source is magical and the final word.  Good science is testing, auditing, verifying from many different sources.  

Example, I've seen great debates of reasonable people debating whether CPI is good or should be improved, particularly how it measures shelter and comparing it to history.

https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf

In this post though I am particularly interested in this claim of unemployment.  

Maybe those with a background in econometrics can chime in with whether there are any potential distortions in unemployment or if there are reasons to believe perhaps it is lagging?  Anything backed with data or links to articles by economists would be great, refutation or support both appreciated.

If so obviously this could have large implications on consumer spending and market valuations going forward.",2024-01-28 17:50:24,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153473,31 days 21:39:23.153473,148,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ad8dys/billionaire_bond_fund_manager_questions/

1acw7qp,stocks,U.S. to reportedly announce billions of dollars in subsidies for advanced chips,"The Biden administration is expected to award billions of dollars in subsidies to top semiconductor companies, including Intel
 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
. (TSMC), in the coming weeks to help build new factories in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.


The forthcoming announcements are aimed at kick-starting manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence and weapons systems, the WSJ reported, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations.


The executives expect some announcements to come before U.S. President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on March 7, the WSJ report added.


Among the likely recipients of the subsidies, Intel has projects underway in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon that will cost more than $43.5 billion, the Journal said.


TSMC has two plants under construction near Phoenix for a total investment of $40 billion. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, also a contender, has a $17.3 billion project in Texas.


Micron Technology
, Texas Instruments
 and GlobalFoundries
 count among other top contenders, WSJ said, citing industry executives.


The U.S. Department of Commerce, Intel, and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.


In December 2023, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she would make around a dozen funding awards for semiconductor chips within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production.


The first award was announced in December, of over $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes, part of a $39 billion “Chips for America” subsidy program approved by the U.S. Congress in 2022.",2024-01-28 06:27:25,2024-02-29 15:29:47.153480,32 days 09:02:22.153480,242,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1acw7qp/us_to_reportedly_announce_billions_of_dollars_in/

1acbt8k,stocks,Goldman Sachs Outlook 2024: America Powers On,"US equities continued to outperform other regions in 2023, as they have done since the global financial crisis trough in March 2009.
 Over this period, Goldman Sachs Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group’s (ISG) two primary investment themes of “US Preeminence” and “Stay Invested” have served their clients well. 
Here’s a snapshot from their 2024 Outlook:
US Preeminence
ISG believes US preeminence is supported by an unparalleled combination of factors including holding 26% of global GDP, having the largest, broadest, and most liquid financial markets, and resilience, among others.
Stay Invested
ISG underscores the importance of staying invested in US equities compared to other markets due to several key reasons such as strong earnings growth potential of US companies and that US assets could provide safe haven as the world confronts higher geopolitical risks in 2024.
Other takeaways
Most of the key risks to ISG’s 2024 Outlook originate from heightened geopolitical tensions and escalating wars.",2024-01-27 14:19:10,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806182,33 days 01:10:38.806183,1,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1acbt8k/goldman_sachs_outlook_2024_america_powers_on/

1ac4v6b,stocks,Tesla's guidance for next year changed everything; where do we see the stock stabilizing and when? educated opinions are welcome:,"*Production dropping, softening demand, price cuts, accelerated depreciation, BYD's market share and Musk's leveraging AI for voting power... Next year's guidance, or lack thereof, totally changed the game for Tesla. Where do we see the stock settling now. It's -27% YTD. I thought it was around 175, but the bears have gotten more bearish and with hopes for rate cuts abating as GDP grew 3.3 and disinflation chugging on, I'm not sure anymore. Where do you see Tesla's stock landing?*

***This is from*** ***CNBC Pro.....***

***Key Takeaway:***

*\*JPMorgan cuts Tesla's price target to $130, predicting a 30% drop due to profit concerns and high valuation at 56 times 2024 consensus earnings.*

*\*Despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume, Tesla's Q4 automotive revenue grew only by 1%, indicating price cuts aren't boosting revenue significantly.*

*\*Tesla's operating profit forecast for this year is now $11.4 billion, down from an October estimate of $28.5 billion, yet share prices remain similar.*

***JPMorgan Lowers Price Target for Tesla:***

*JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cuts the stock price target for Tesla by about 4% to $130, implying a 30% downside from Thursday’s close of $182.63. The reduction follows softer than expected earnings and a warning from Tesla that vehicle volume growth ""may be notably lower"" this year. Despite these warnings, Tesla's stock closed down only 12%, suggesting further downside potential according to Brinkman.*

***Falling Profits and Valuation Concerns:***

*Tesla's strategy of slashing vehicle prices has not translated into higher revenue, with actual automotive revenue growing by only 1% despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume in the fourth quarter. Analysts have substantially lowered profit expectations for Tesla since October 2022, with operating profit forecasted at $11.4 billion compared to the previous estimate of $28.5 billion for 2024.*

*Brinkman rates Tesla as underweight due to above-average execution risk and valuation concerns that seem to be pricing in significant upside related to expansion into mass-market segments beyond their volume forecasts for the Model 3.*

***STREET VIEWS***

*Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan Analyst (Bearish on Tesla):*

*""Tesla profit expectations have fallen, but even after Thursday's sell-off, the stock to us seems in comparison to have hardly noticed, suggesting plenty of further downside potential."" ""Tesla did not trade profits for sales as measured in revenue — it has traded profits for sales as measured in unit volume."" ""Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition.""*

1abjlcx,stocks,LVMH shares jump as earnings point to luxury sector resilience,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/lvmh-shares-jump-8percent-as-earnings-point-to-luxury-sector-resilience.html

LVMH shares jumped more than 12% on Friday morning, after the world’s largest luxury group posted higher-than-expected sales for 2023 and raised its annual dividend. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, as well as brands including Givenchy, Bulgari and Sephora, on Thursday night reported sales amounting to 86.15 billion euros ($93.34 billion) for 2023, exceeding consensus forecasts and equating to 13% organic growth from the previous year. Organic revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter. The result was boosted in particular by 14% annual growth in the critical fashion and leather goods sector, along with 11% growth in perfumes and cosmetics. Wines and spirits meanwhile posted a 4% decline.

“Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement. “While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams.” After a boom during the pandemic, the luxury sector endured a rough end to 2023 as challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions weighed on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S. and China. LVMH in April 2023 became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value, but a share price decline over the last six months allowed it to be eclipsed as Europe’s largest company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

Javier Gonzalez Lastra, portfolio manager of the Tema Luxury ETF, told CNBC on Thursday that investors are trying to gauge where the bottom of the earnings cycle revision is for the luxury sector. He predicted that earnings are “likely to get tougher” through the first half of 2024 because of last year’s unusually high annual comparisons. Arnault, however, is pinning some hope on LVMH’s partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympics, which he said “provides a new opportunity to reinforce our global leadership position in luxury goods and promote France’s reputation for excellence around the world.",2024-01-26 14:28:51,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806239,34 days 01:00:57.806239,7,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1abjlcx/lvmh_shares_jump_as_earnings_point_to_luxury/
1abjaix,stocks,Fed’s favorite inflation gauge rose 0.2% in December and was up 2.9% from a year ago,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/pce-inflation-december-2023-.html

An important inflation gauge released Friday showed that the rate of price increases cooled as 2023 came to a close.

The Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index for December, an important gauge for the Federal Reserve, increased 0.2% on the month and was up 2.9% on a yearly basis, excluding food and energy. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective increases of 0.2% and 3%.

On a monthly basis, core inflation increased from 0.1% in November. However, the annual rate declined from 3.2%. The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021.

Including volatile food and energy costs, headline inflation also rose 0.2% for the month and held steady at 2.6% annually.

The release adds to evidence that inflation, while still elevated, is continuing to make progress lower, possibly giving the Fed a green light to start cutting interest rates later this year. The central bank targets 2% as a healthy annual inflation rate.

Markets took little notice of the data, with stock futures indicating little change at the open and Treasury yields mostly lower.

As inflation drifted closer to the Fed’s target, consumer spending increased 0.7%, stronger than the 0.5% estimate. Personal income growth edged lower to 0.3%, in line with the forecast.

The data indicated that consumers are dipping into savings to pay for their expenditures. The personal savings rate fell to 3.7% for the month, down from 4.1% in November.

Within the inflation numbers, prices for goods declined by 0.2% while services prices rose by 0.3%, reversing a trend when inflation began to spike. As the pandemic forced people to stay home more, demand for goods spiked, adding to supply chain problems and exacerbating price increases.

Food prices increased 0.1% on the month while energy goods and services rose 0.3%. Prices for longer-lasting durable goods such as appliances, computers and vehicles decreased 0.4%.",2024-01-26 14:14:19,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806243,34 days 01:15:29.806243,113,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1abjaix/feds_favorite_inflation_gauge_rose_02_in_december/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I'm anticipating the market to decline a few months after the yield curve un-inverts. That said, I'm not betting on a quick market crash of a month, but a longer extended market downturn that takes place over a year. What are my options?

* **Hold as cash or bonds** - This seems the safest options, but has no real upsides in the event of an actual market crash, only the prevention of downside losses.

* **Short selling** - I don't want to take on margin interest for that long for a limited upside, plus there's always the saying ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent""

* **buy put options** - Will these suffer from terrible theta decay over 1 year period?

* **put option spread** - If I buy an OTM put and sell a farther OTM put, this should reduce some of the costs of theta decay. But may limit upside.

19fk5fp,stocks,Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.",2024-01-25 21:17:40,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806272,34 days 18:12:08.806272,226,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19fk5fp/intel_stock_sinks_as_early_2024_outlook_comes_up/

19ffrvq,stocks,Sales of new homes surged in December as mortgage rates dipped below 7%,"Relevant to homebuilder tickers such as $PHM, $LEN, $DHI, $TOL, $MDC and mortgage lenders / credit agencies like $RKT, $UWMC, $TRU.

>New residential sales rose, led by a boost in the Northeast

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-homes-sales-surge-8-in-december-6ad57a5a

U.S. new-home sales rose 8% to an annual rate of 664,000 in December from a revised 615,000 in the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 

The number is seasonally adjusted and refers to how many homes would be built over an entire year if builders continued at the same pace every month.

The pace exceeded expectations on Wall Street. Economists had forecast new-home sales to total 649,000 in December.

Mortgage rates dipped below 7% in early December 2023, according to data from Freddie Mac, which could be one reason for increased demand for homes.

New-home sales are still far below a recent peak of over 1 million in August 2020. 

The increase in new-home sales in December was the largest in a year. New-home sales are still far below a recent peak of over 1 million in August 2020. 

The rate of new-home sales was boosted by a sharp increase in the Northeast.

Key details: The median sales price of a new home sold in December fell to $413,200 from $426,000 in the prior month.

The supply of new homes for sale fell 6.8% between November and December.

Most of the U.S. reported an increase in sales of newly built homes, with the Northeast notching a 32% increase in December, followed by more modest increases of around 10% in the Midwest and the South. Only the West saw a drop in new-home sales.

Overall, sales of new homes are up 4.4% compared with last year.

Big picture: New-home sales continue to be a bright spot in the housing sector, and as mortgage rates fall, demand could be further boosted. The housing market continues to rely on newly built homes amid a persistent lack of resale home listings.

What are they saying? New-home sales will continue to rise in 2024, Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note, as the lock-in effect of current homeowners’ low mortgage rates won’t fade fast enough, “keeping the supply of secondhand homes on the market historically low.”

He added: “Therefore, we’re forecasting new-home sales to reach 781,000 annualized by end-2024, their highest level since the second spike in the demand for new homes at the beginning of 2022.”

Rob Bowman, president of Charter Homes & Neighborhoods, a Pennsylvania-based home builder, said that “there’s still a tremendous need for housing in the U.S. We’re seeing demand across the board,” he told MarketWatch.",2024-01-25 18:13:06,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806280,34 days 21:16:42.806280,24,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19ffrvq/sales_of_new_homes_surged_in_december_as_mortgage/

19feuv4,stocks,PayPal to launch AI-based products as new CEO aims to revive share price,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - PayPal is launching new artificial intelligence-driven products as well as a one-click checkout feature, the company said on Thursday as its chief executive tries to inject new life into the payments giant.  
It is the first major announcement under Alex Chriss, who joined PayPal in September, and the new products are another example of how companies are trying to tap investor enthusiasm for AI, which helped drive U.S. stock markets to record highs this month.  
Investors hope Chriss, who was previously a senior executive at software company Intuit, will revive PayPal's stock which is down more than 22% from January last year due to margins which have underwhelmed investors. Chriss has called 2024 a ""transition year"" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume.  
""The data that we have and our ability to actually see what people have bought and know what merchants are trying to target, that's where I think AI is the huge opportunity for us,"" Chriss told Reuters in an interview.  
PayPal will this year roll out a platform that uses AI to enable merchants to reach new customers based on their prior shopping history, using data from the roughly half a trillion dollars' worth of merchant transactions it has processed globally.  
Merchants will also be able to use a separate AI-based tool called ""smart receipts"" to recommend personalized items to shoppers in their email receipts, along with a cashback reward.  
PayPal is introducing a ""one-click"" checkout feature called Fastlane, which in early testing has accelerated checkout speeds nearly 40%, along with new features for Venmo business profiles, the company said.  
The S&P 500 index climbed to its fourth straight record high close on Wednesday, fueled in part by a rally in technology stocks on AI optimism. PayPal reports fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 7.

19fcdy7,stocks,Comcast stock jumps 5%; +7% up in dividend; 15bil buybacks; double beat but lost x2 broadband (34k); Cable (389k) & Peacock lost ($825mil).,"*(Question) Realistically, what are the prospects for Peacock on its own? how do we justify these losses? it's consistently the worst-rated streamer, clocking the highest churn, and all its gains come from temporary spikes due to sport events! Netflix has scale, Disney has scale & a diverse hand (Hulu, D+, ESPN+), Max leads market in quality. As for Paramount+ & Peacock! they seem like money pits to me.* 

***This comes from the*** [***Hollywood Reporter***](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comcast-earnings-peacock-loss-2023-nbcuniversal-1235805822/)***: CFO Jason Armstrong on Peacock:*** 

*Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong told analysts during a morning call that the 3 million new Peacock subscribers during the latest financial quarter came in part from viewers drawn to NFL and Big Ten football games, without specifying actual numbers. NBCU’s loss related to Peacock amounted to $825 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $978 million on revenue of $660 million.*  
*Cavanagh during the conference call talked up Peacock streaming a Saturday night wildcard NFL playoff game, which averaged 23 million viewers on the flagship online platform, local NBC affiliates in the teams’ home markets and on the NFL+ mobile app.*  
*“Our investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the Internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth,” he told analysts.* 

*To additionally bolster Peacock, Cavanagh reiterated that Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-nominated Oppenheimer biopic will exclusively stream on Peacock from Feb. 16, well after its theatrical release from July 2023. And he touted the 2024 Olympics set to stream on Peacock live, with many of the events also airing live on NBC and other NBCUniversal TV platforms.*  
*Cavanagh called Peacock “the fastest growing streamer in the U.S.,” as he looked beyond continuing operating losses to leveraging the streamer as part an overall and expanding TV offering for consumers across a range of NBCUniversal platforms treated as one holistic ecosystem. CFO Armstrong told analysts: “2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvements in losses, versus 2023.” The entertainment conglomerate previously had vowed to reach “peak losses” at around $2.8 billion for Peacock in 2023, down from $3 billion previously. On Thursday, it disclosed that the 2023 loss had amounted to $2.75 billion. Peacock’s revenue continued to grow in the latest period and for all of 2023.*  
*Cavanagh told analysts he was more focused on how Peacock was faring amidst NBCUniversal TV’s overall strategy, than on its own. “I’m less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what’s right fro the long term and the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we’ve navigated a very good path for us,” he said.*  
*As legacy media cedes streaming subscriber scale to Netflix, streaming profits have been in focus for Wall Street. For comparison, in its most recent quarter Warner Bros. Discovery posted a $111 million profit for its direct-to-consumer division that includes Max/Discovery+, while Paramount Global disclosed a $424 million streaming loss and Disney lost $387 million on its Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu combined business.*  
*The latest Peacock updates were part of Comcast’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report.*

19f6jhh,stocks,China says Boeing has permission to resume 737 MAX 8 deliveries,"BEIJING, Jan 25 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it gave Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab permission last month to resume deliveries of its 737 MAX 8 to local customers, ending an import freeze on the U.S. planemaker's most profitable jets which came shortly after its first delivery in 2019.

China's green-light is a boost to the planemaker, which has been hit by the fallout from a mid-air blowout of a cabin panel on a 737 MAX 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration barring Boeing from expanding production of its best-selling narrowbody planes.

19f3fgb,stocks,Why I’m Buying Rivian Stock,"Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I’m not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I’m a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go…  
  
Now, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why.

# Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers

Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:

1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.
2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it’s own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.
4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.

Okay, okay, okay… I’ve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn’t mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all… Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn’t even profitable yet. If you’re going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???  
  
Tesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not.   
  
This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.   
  
Anyway, lets continue….

# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love

Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.   
  
While most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T.   
  
Now, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….  
  
But the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.   
  
Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.  
  
Moreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).  
  
But EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….

# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now

Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:

* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.
* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.
* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.
* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.
* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.
* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. 

Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….

&#x200B;

* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. 
   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.
   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. 
   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.

&#x200B;

* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. 
   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.
   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”

&#x200B;

* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. 
   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. 
   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).

&#x200B;

* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.
   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.

&#x200B;

* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…** Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.
   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”
   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.
   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.

&#x200B;

* **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.
   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. 

&#x200B;

* **Tesla Supercharger Access**
   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….
   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.
   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. 

If you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.  
  
However, this investing thing is not for weaklings….

# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:

I’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:

&#x200B;

* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**
   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. 
   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.

&#x200B;

* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** 
   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. 
   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. 
   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. 
   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.

&#x200B;

* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**
   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. 
   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**
   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.
   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.
   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. 

&#x200B;

* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** 
   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. 
   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).
   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.

&#x200B;

* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** 
   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.

&#x200B;

* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** 
   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.
   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. 
   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.

# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)

I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.

Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.

The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.

Tesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company….

But I do believe Rivian could easily get back to its IPO price in the of $70’s if it executes well on its vision over the next 2-3 years. That is what I’m hoping for. 

# Conclusion

I spent all day writing this. I’m tired of typing. I hope someone out there can poke some holes in my thesis so I can sell my shares and put my $$ back into an index fund where it belongs. But I also hope that I’m right and this stock gradually rises in value over the next few years. Right now I’m committed. I’m freaking pumped about it. 

Maybe I’m just dumb and this whole idea is terrible…. If you think I'm missing something, please feel free to tell me in the comments below.

I have been experimenting with a few basic strategies since last summer. Then I found paper trading and I decided to put them to the test. I created several portfolios last July. 

Very quickly I could see how the random stock picking portfolio based on recommendations was garbage. 

Then I came across the basic ETF strategies. So I made a Voo and chill portfolio, an 80/20 Boglehead portfolio and 6 portfolios based on MPT. They mostly all hold 6 tickets but one has 12. They are all high Sharpe ratio and have low variance because I chose stocks with very low correlation. 

All portfolios started at $50,000 and I made the lump sum purchases on July 28th. 

-The Boglehead is the worst performer, being up 3.35%. 

- Voo is +6.17%

Then the MPT portfolios range from +16.64% to +27.05%. 

Tonight I will record the results and reset the board and try again starting with today. 

Are there any retail investors managing their own portfolios who are beating the market?",2024-01-25 06:48:47,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806334,35 days 08:41:01.806335,346,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19f3ah0/are_you_beating_the_market/
19ey3gs,stocks,Texas Instruments TXN earnings recap,"Notes: 2022 data is included to have a YoY baseline. This data may contain errors. 

**Q4 2023 Key Points:**  
Profit and Revenue: Revenue declined to $4.08 billion from $4.67 billion in Q4 2022, a significant decrease. Gross profit dropped from $3.1 billion to $2.43 billion.  
Economic Trends and Market Conditions: The call highlighted issues with underutilization and adjustments to factory loadings, indicating a response to market demands and inventory levels.  
Management's Tone and Strategy: Management discussed maintaining a pricing strategy despite market challenges, suggesting a focus on long-term stability over short-term gains.  
Dividends and Shareholder Returns: Dividends per common share increased from $1.24 to $1.30, showing a commitment to shareholder returns despite financial challenges.  


**Year-Over-Year Comparison:**  
Revenue and Profit Decline: There was a notable decline in both revenue and profit year-over-year, indicating challenging market conditions in 2023.  
Market Segments Shift: While automotive remained strong in both years, the industrial sector's performance seemed to have weakened in 2023.  
Strategic Focus and Response to Economic Trends: The company maintained a strategic focus on industrial and automotive sectors, but faced challenges in utilization and market demand, leading to adjustments in factory loadings.  
Shareholder Returns: Despite financial challenges, TXN continued to increase dividends, showing a strong commitment to shareholder value.  


**Stock Price Analysis:**  
2022 Performance: The stock may have been positively influenced by the company's solid performance in automotive and industrial segments, along with generous shareholder returns.  
2023 Challenges: The drop in revenue and profit, along with operational challenges, could have negatively impacted the stock price. The company's consistent dividend increase, however, may have provided some stability.  


**Overall Insights:**  
Texas Instruments has faced significant challenges in 2023, with decreased revenue and profitability compared to 2022.  
The company's strategic focus remains on the industrial and automotive sectors, but the industrial sector has shown weakness in 2023.  
Despite economic challenges, TXN has maintained its commitment to shareholder returns through consistent dividend increases.  
Operational adjustments reflect a response to changing market demands and inventory management challenges.  
The stock's performance is likely impacted by these financial and operational challenges, but the commitment to shareholder returns may have provided some support.",2024-01-25 02:03:46,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806338,35 days 13:26:02.806339,5,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19ey3gs/texas_instruments_txn_earnings_recap/
19etgi6,stocks,Peacock gained 2.8mil subs from NFL playoff in one day. ESPN clocks 6 of its 7 most-viewed games ever just in the past two seasons.,"***.....................correction: 2.8 million over 3 days, not 1 day.***

*\*****Peacock****:*

*Earlier this month, NBC Universal said the NFL playoff game it streamed (mostly) exclusively on Peacock, its streaming service, was a huge success.*

*NBC and its parent company, Comcast, backed up that claim by citing ratings — it drew some 23 million viewers — and self-generated statistics about internet usage during the game. Crucially, it didn't say how many people signed up (and paid for) Peacock to watch the game.*

*Now we (probably) know: Peacock signed up nearly 3 million subscribers for the game. That's according to subscription tracking service Antenna, which says 2.8 million people signed up over a three-day window leading up to the January 13 game. Antenna says that's the biggest sign-up around a ""singular programming event"" it has ever seen. (It says Disney+ signed up 2.5 million people on its launch day in 2019, though Disney announced 10 million signups. You can read about Antenna's methodology and the possible difference between those numbers here.)*

*A Comcast rep declined to comment on Antenna's report. Comcast reports earnings on Thursday. So, yes: It appears that despite the many complaints you may have heard or seen, putting a very high-profile NFL playoff game (featuring shots of Taylor Swift cheering on Travis Kelce) on a paid streaming service will induce people to sign up for that service.*

*The next big question: How many of those folks will stick around and keep paying after the game — especially because churn is a major issue for streamers? We won't know that answer for a while.*

.................

***\*ESPN:***

*Texans-Ravens clash drew 31.8 million viewers, most-watched NFL game in ESPN history. Nearly 32 million people tuned in to witness Lamar Jackson’s dominant performance in the Baltimore Ravens’ 34-10 win over the Houston Texans on Saturday night, making it the most-watched NFL game in ESPN history, according to a company news release. The game was aired on ESPN, ABC, ESPN+ & ESPN Deportes*

*The audience of 31.8 million viewers — which swelled to a peak of 36.2 million in the third quarter — surpassed the company’s record of 31.2 million viewers, which was set on Jan. 16, 2023, when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2023 wild-card round.*

*The company’s “Monday Night Football” broadcasts also had a record-breaking 2023 season, with its three most-viewed MNF games all occurring in November and December 2023.*

*According to ESPN, the Texans-Ravens game bested the NFL game marks from all Disney-owned channel broadcasts, excluding Super Bowls. This includes games played on ABC. The company aired Super Bowl XXXIV, Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XL.*

*NBC’s broadcast of the Miami Dolphins falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in the wild-card round exclusively on Peacock drew 23 million viewers, making it the most-streamed game in NFL history. The 2023 AFC Championship Game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs on CBS averaged 53.1 million viewers.*

*.*.........................................

*This question was asked by* [*WSJ*](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-earnings-01-24-2024/card/just-how-many-netflix-freeloaders-are-left--8qrQrTw3zja7f0GMxJSc?siteid=yhoof2)*, behind a paywall. It was also addressed by* [*Citibank*](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/three-remains-why-analyst-neutral-151413530.html) *after downgrading Netflix to ""Neutral"". Both inputs made after the latest earnings call reporting a gain of 13 million subs, most of which is international.*

*The number of households password-sharing was reported by Netflix to shareholders a few years ago and was reported by* [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2023/02/09/netflix-password-sharing-everything-you-need-to-know/?sh=2d9cb77963b0)*; worldwide, there's* ***100 million households*** *password-sharing of whom* ***30 million households*** *are in the US/Canada. It's also been monitored by market research companies which reported an uptick in cancellations overwhelmed by an uptick in registrations.*

***Clearing House collaborated with MoffettNathanson to*** [*survey*](https://www.lightreading.com/video-streaming/study-netflix-s-password-sharing-crackdown-poised-to-add-subs-and-revenues) ***19k people (3 months ago):*** *22% to 32% of the 30 million Netflix password-sharing users will become new paying subscribers. ""Of course, people's intentions change ... but if Netflix is able to entice 25% of current sharers to re-subscribe to their ad-tier, that would translate to 6.8 million net adds and $567 million in incremental annual subscription revenue,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson explained in the report (registration required). ""Net-net, so while this might not be the home run that the Bulls might believe, the near-term opportunity to continue adding subscribers in North America seems very likely. ""The survey found that 23% of accounts that engage in password-sharing have received a notice from the streamer that they are in violation of the new policy. Of that group, about 72% have since lost access to their shared account. ""This implies Netflix has ample room to go in rolling out warnings and enforcement of this measure,"" Nathanson wrote. But he allows that there's some squishiness in those findings since it's possible that some survey respondents might not be fully aware they are in violation of Netflix's new rules. Among the group that currently shares a subscription and has not yet lost access to a shared account, 22% either plan to get their own subscription or have already done so. That's a possible indicator that ""when push comes to shove, many find themselves missing their Netflix access more than they had thought,"" Nathanson surmised.*

***So we know the numbers to draw from are massive*** *(100 million): and these are the* ***gains of subs*** *over the last 4 quarters:* ***Q1***: *1.75mil*, ***Q2***: *5.89mil*, ***Q3***: *9mil*, ***Q4***: *13mil*.

*It stands to reason that the ""content"" threshold to convert a freeloader to a subscriber is lower than the acquisition of a new subscriber from a competitive market. It's also true that Netflix had to actively entice a freeloader to convert with good content. So is reducing content next year prudent?*

*How much of this growth is password-sharing crackdown? and how much of it is left to draw from? what do the numbers look like going forward? Disney started password sharing crackdown in Canada last November, what should we expect from Disney?*

19enxxc,stocks,"COSTCO Stock Analysis: 571$ Fair Value - DCF, Graham, Fear & Greed, DuPont","Hi all Redditors!  SmellyFatCock here!

24M about to graduate in and get my bachelor in Business Economics & Management; recently I found a nice hobby: stock valuation and analysis

Today I am presenting you COSTCO. If you need the excel file to look into my calculations just DM me! Let's start!

What is COSTCO?

It is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs. The company is one of the largest retailers in the world and is known for its unique business model and emphasis on providing value to its customers. Key aspects of what the company does are:

1. **Membership-Based Model**: Costco operates on a membership-based system. Customers need to pay an annual fee to become members, and in return, they gain access to the exclusive deals and discounts offered by the store.
2. **Warehouse Club**s: Costco's stores are warehouse-style retail outlets where customers can purchase a wide variety of products in bulk. These products range from groceries and household items to electronics, appliances, clothing, and more.
3. **Low Prices**: Costco is renowned for its commitment to offering high-quality products at low prices. The company achieves this by selling items in larger quantities, thereby reducing packaging costs and passing the savings on to customers.
4. **Private Label Products**: Costco sells a significant number of private-label or in-house brands. These are products that carry the Costco brand name.
5. **Rotating Inventory**: Costco frequently changes its product selection, introducing new items and removing others. This approach can be seen by its average Inventory Turnover of 12
6. **Services**: In addition to retail products, Costco offers a range of services, including travel bookings, insurance, and optical and pharmacy services. They also have a popular food court known for its low-cost food items.

Analyzing its Financial Statements, I can say that Costco's has a **Fair Value of 571$**

Why? Let me explain

&#x200B;

**Valuation Metric 3: Fear & Greed Index**

The index goes from 0 to 100, where 50 is neutral, 100 is extreme greed and 0 is extreme fear.

Doing a proportion, making 100 correspond to 20% in growth boost and 0 to -20% boost, the current F&G index is at 77, thus giving a growth boost of 10.80%

|**Asset to Equity**|2,97 x|3,28 x|3,11 x|2,75 x|**3,03 x**|

Main Observations (expanding the analysis in the excel file, I just show the 3 main components here):

* Something is eating gross profit margin, thus it makes me thing the cost of goods have increased in the last two years;
* Net Profit margin is stable in the last four years, making me thing it would be in 2024 too
* Observing in the asset part, we can see some issues in the Inventory Turnover and Account Receivable Turnover for 2022 that impacted negatively to the Cash Turnover for 2023
* The company is managing very well its asset

Knowing this, I will add a 2% growth rate to the base, bringing the **expected growth 28,94%** for the revenue

&#x200B;

# Conclusions

I still have to do some Benchmarking with the Industry and Peers to better adjust the numbers and observe analysts expectations for 2024's market, leaving it here for you all to criticise and give tips and opinions, I am still new to those kind of stuff and it is just an Hobby for me, for now

For now, my position is: Mid-Long Term Bear, expecting correction and price hovering around 600$ if any shenanigans happens

19enxd5,stocks,CPI and inflation could be regulated by tax rates,"Hear me out. I don’t see prices at grocery stores being reduced. I see restaurants, housing, car market slowing. 
Wouldn’t creating a sliding tax on corporations who sell goods with over 100% margins get them to reduce prices further?

I get the logistics would be extremely difficult to determine margins etc but not impossible and if manipulated they could be fined.

I just don’t see how there are any incentives for reducing prices when they make record profits even if housing and car prices go down.

If interest rates go down people have more money to spend and get reduced rate loans which allows them to buy more at these higher margins.

It makes me question the market overall moving forward. I would love to hear others thoughts on this.",2024-01-24 18:50:02,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806374,35 days 20:39:46.806374,47,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19enxd5/cpi_and_inflation_could_be_regulated_by_tax_rates/

19ejjpu,stocks,"Boeing, not Spirit, mis-installed piece that blew off Alaska MAX 9 jet, industry source says","Dominic Gates By Dominic Gates 
Seattle Times aerospace reporter

The fuselage panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines jet earlier this month was removed for repair then reinstalled improperly by Boeing mechanics on the Renton final assembly line, a person familiar with the details of the work told The Seattle Times.

If verified by the National Transportation Safety Board investigation, this would leave Boeing primarily at fault for the accident, rather than its supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which originally installed the panel into the 737 MAX 9 fuselage in Wichita, Kan.

That panel, a door plug used to seal a hole in the fuselage sometimes used to accommodate an emergency exit, blew out of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 as it climbed out of Portland on Jan. 5. The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp criticism of Boeing’s quality control systems and safety culture, which has been under the microscope since two fatal 737 MAX crashes five years ago.

Last week, an anonymous whistleblower — who appears to have access to Boeing’s manufacturing records of the work done assembling the specific Alaska Airlines jet that suffered the blowout — on an aviation website separately provided many additional details about how the door plug came to be removed and then mis-installed.

“The reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing’s own records,” the whistleblower wrote. “It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.”

The self-described Boeing insider said company records show four bolts that prevent the door plug from sliding up off the door frame stop pads that take the pressurization loads in flight, “were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane.” the whistleblower stated. “Our own records reflect this.”

NTSB investigators already publicly raised the possibility that the bolts had not been installed.

The account goes on to describe shocking lapses in Boeing’s quality control process in Renton.

The work of the mechanics on the door plug should have been formally inspected and signed off by a Boeing quality inspector.

It wasn’t, the whistleblower wrote, because of a process failure and the use of two separate systems to record what work was accomplished.

Boeing’s 737 production system is described as “a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.”

If that account of what happened is indeed fully documented in Boeing’s system it should be readily verified by the investigation.

The Seattle Times offered Boeing the opportunity to dispute the details in this story. Citing the ongoing investigation, Boeing declined to comment. Likewise, so did Spirit, the FAA, the Machinists union and the NTSB.",2024-01-24 15:22:51,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806394,36 days 00:06:57.806395,108,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19ejjpu/boeing_not_spirit_misinstalled_piece_that_blew/

* Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia said on Wednesday they had partnered up to offer the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients.

* The service will make it easier for companies to own artificial intelligence computing systems and have better control over their data, instead of renting out Nvidia's market-leading chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon.com or Microsoft.

* Many large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and requiring liquid cooling.

* Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.

* ""We want to drive privacy because what we're hearing at large customers is they are very worried about controlling their own destiny,"" Jon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, told Reuters in an interview.

* However, ""being able to then figure out how to operate (AI data centers) efficiently and effectively - this is an entirely new set of capabilities that is not generally available.""

19e8gap,stocks,Boeing plans safety ‘stand down’ as United reconsiders 737 MAX orders,"By Lauren Rosenblatt 
Seattle Times staff reporter

On the same day United Airlines said it would consider alternatives to Boeing for its next airplane order, the manufacturer announced a one-day work pause at its Renton factory for employees to learn and focus on quality assurance. 

Boeing 737 MAX workers from the production, delivery and support teams in Renton will spend Thursday participating in working sessions, the company said on Tuesday. It is the first of many “Quality Stand Down” days Boeing will host over the next few weeks at its factories. 

Employees will participate in “hands-on learning, reflection and collaboration,” Boeing wrote in a note sent to all commercial airplanes employees and posted on its website. The goal is to identify quality and compliance improvements and create actionable plans, according to the note.

Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive officer, said in a statement the sessions will allow “all teammates who touch the airplane to pause, evaluate what we’re doing, how we’re doing it and make recommendations for improvement.” 

The pause is part of a list of immediate actions Boeing plans to take following the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 safety incident earlier this month when a panel blew off an 737 MAX 9 fuselage midflight. That panel was a door plug filling a space that some airlines use as an emergency exit. 

The flight landed safely in Portland but the incident has heightened scrutiny of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing’s supplier that builds MAX fuselages.

The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the 737 MAX 9 planes that fill the open space with a door plug shortly after the incident. Those planes, flown by Alaska Airlines and United in the U.S., will remain grounded until they are inspected, following instructions from Boeing and the FAA.

On Sunday, the FAA recommended airlines also inspect another, older Boeing model — the 737-900ER — that has the same door plug design. 

Since the fuselage blowout, Boeing has said it will implement additional inspections as its planes are built, work alongside teams at Spirit to ensure door plugs are properly installed and open its factories to additional oversight. It also hired Admiral Kirkland Donald to lead a third-party review of Boeing’s quality management system. 

“We have taken important steps in recent years to strengthen our Quality Management System’s foundation and its layers of protection. But the AS1282 accident and recent customer findings make clear that we are not where we need to be,” Deal wrote in a message to employees last week. 

Alaska and United Airlines both found loose hardware related to the door plug as they began inspecting other planes in their fleets.

On Tuesday morning, United CEO Scott Kirby indicated the airline would consider options other than Boeing for its next airplane order. 

In an interview with CNBC, Kirby said the airline was about five years behind its original order for Boeing’s MAX 10 plane. After the MAX 9 incident, United has begun crafting a new plan that doesn’t include Boeing’s MAX 10, he said.

“I’m disappointed that the manufacturing challenges do keep happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” Kirby said. “I think the MAX grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

The MAX 10, the largest of the four-model MAX line, and the MAX 7 have yet to receive FAA approval to carry passengers.

Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in an NBC interview Tuesday afternoon he was “more than frustrated. … My demand on Boeing is, what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house?” 

Meanwhile, the union representing machinists and aerospace workers at Boeing said Tuesday it had delayed contract negotiations amid the fuselage blowout inspection. Both International Association of Machinists District 751 and Boeing are named as independent parties in the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into the incident. 

Contract negotiations were supposed to begin in early February but are now delayed until early March.",2024-01-24 04:20:30,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806419,36 days 11:09:18.806419,89,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19e8gap/boeing_plans_safety_stand_down_as_united/

19e477f,stocks,Alaska Airlines CEO says company found loose bolts on ‘many’ Boeing Max 9s,"New York
CNN
 — 
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” scheduled to air Tuesday.

It’s the CEO’s first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.

“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,” Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview’s airing.

Boeing’s 737 factory will have what the company calls a “quality stand down” at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.

“During the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,” the company said in a statement.

The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.

NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.

“I think this is the issue that’s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it’s at the highest degree of excellence and that’s what’s got to be different going forward,” he said.

He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker’s production line.

The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.

FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing’s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.

In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: “We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”

The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.

“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”

United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing’s future is also uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.

“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”

19e1zj0,stocks,"Do you prefer companies with high but predictable recurring ROCE, or companies with low prices and high uncertainty?","I for one like to ""set and forget"" in my Roth account, so I lean to businesses with high ROCE that will persist well into the future. I'll pay more hefty P/E multiples (albeit, not crazy) for those companies but it's not a big issue for me, so long as the business is capable of reinvesting those earnings at high rates of return. It strikes me as the Charlie Munger/Terry Smith strategy.

These companies are very difficult to shake off their moats. Unfortunately if they are meaningfully disrupted it may be brutal. Risk is limited by the fact that it's really fucking hard to do that.

Notable examples in my Roth account: Constellation Software, FICO, WM, and railways. I can set them and forget them until I'm 65, and even with the P/E dropping the ""E"" in that equation will compound until I die.

But this strategy seems to run afoul of value investors like Mohnish Pabrai, Aswath Damodaran, Benjaman Graham, and others like them. They like to take on companies that the market has mispriced significantly, where the margin of safety between the price and value limits risk. In other words, the risk is limited by the idea that the price *cannot* drop significantly over the long term from its present value.

19e0odb,stocks,Bitcoin mining companies,"At first it seems like it makes sense to have a small to modest amount of money in miners if you plan to take any profits in the coming cycle(all assuming you have conviction in bitcoin and cycles caused from halving's) since they are seen as a leveraged play on bitcoin. The more I think about it however they seem terribly over valued. Lets take for example Marathon digital holdings. The company owns 15,174 BTC , Mined about 1,800 BTC in 2023 and has a market cap of 3.62 Billion. That means it cost you about $238,565 per bitcoin when BTC sits at 39k if you were to just buy it.  
  
Lets be VERY generous and say even in spite of the halving marathon manages to triple its BTC mined per year bringing the total mined up 5,400 BTC per year. If they mined at this rate for 10 years and didn't sell any to cover costs they would hold approximately 69,174 BTC. Multiply 69174 x 39,500=$2,732,373,000  
  
That is a BTC value of 2.73 billion. From a value investing perspective this is a terrible investment when someone has the ability to buy MicroStrategy A ETF or just hold bitcoin directly in cold storage. Am I missing something here?

- Netflix added 13.1 million subscribers during the fourth quarter.

- The company now has 260.8 million paid subscribers.

- The company also topped Wall Street’s revenue expectations.

Here are the results:

- Earnings: $2.11 per share vs. $2.22 per share expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

- Revenue: $8.83 billion vs. $8.71 billion expected by LSEG.

- Total memberships expected: 260.8 million vs. 256 million expected, according to Street Account

- The company now has 260.8 million paid subscribers, a new record for the streamer.

In October, the company said it added 8.76 million paid memberships in the third quarter, pushing its total to 247 million. Wall Street expects Netflix to have continued that trend in the fourth quarter, with forecasts projecting another 8 million to 9 million paid membership adds, bringing the company to roughly 256 million. Netflix took another step toward building subscribers when it announced earlier Tuesday that it would stream the popular WWE Raw starting next year. The deal is the streaming platform’s biggest step yet into live entertainment.

Netflix is still navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue. Investors got a sneak preview of growth in Netflix’s advertising-based plan earlier this month, when the company’s president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, told attendees at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES that the company now has more than 23 million global monthly active users. That’s up from 15 million that the company reported in November.

**ADM,** liquidity 8/10- Yesterday, had news to place their CFO on admin leave, today news was released that the investigation is “hopefully” concluded by end of February. This may be fraud, be careful.   
  
**JBLU/SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- SAVE still coming in with massive volume and upward movement, likely due to JBLU saying they will appeal the decision. I personally am not a long-term holder in this, if JBLU really succeeds in appealing this is a process that will likely takes months. Still worth looking for a trade in this.   
  
**TKO,** liquidity 7/10- Made deal with Netflix for content, and Dwayne Johnson appointed to board. Up 20% from this news.   
  
**BILI- l**iquidity, 7/10- Chinese gaming regulators to remove rules for controlling spending in video games  
  
**BABA**\- liquidity, 8/10- Rumor that Jack Ma has been buying BABA shares  
  
**NVDA,** liquidity 8/10- Sold off slightly today, we couldn’t hold the 600 level. Could see this reclaim the $600 level, large 13 point move off the open.   
  
**Stocks worth watching on a longer timeframe**   
  
**TSLA,** liquidity 7/10- Worth watching with Elon Musk fighting for 25% ownership of the company.  
  
**JNPR,** liquidity 9/10 – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.  
  
**NS-** to be acquired by Sunoco for $7B in stock.  
  
**M-** rejects $5.8B cash bid, saying it is not good enough (21/sh). Could see this go higher from a rival bidder

............

***\*Marvel - Insomniac licensing terms for an upcoming game (X-men; one of 4 upcoming)***:

*In the late 2010's Iger closed Disney's gaming divisions retaining a small staff whose sole function is to license out & creatively cooperate and supervise: Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games...etc*. *The 2010's saw a shift in video gaming where emphasis shifted to making few games but of supreme quality, narrative and graphics. These games today are incredibly expensive costing at times $200-300mil*. *One of those games is Spiderman2 just released to become the fastest selling video game in Playstation history*. *In the leaks, licensing terms are defined by Marvel for the game developer:*

***-Conditions on budget:*** *each game gets at least* ***$120 million*** *for production and* ***$30*** *million for marketing.*

*-****Exclusivity:*** *Disney doesn't release licensed characters in any other video game; total of 4 up until* ***2035****.*

***-Marvel Royalties:*** *several tiers depending on number of sales. If sales are above 7 million units: Disney gets* ***26% of net digital sales*** *(includes DLCs),* ***18% of physical sales***\*, and finally\* ***50% of bundled games***\*.\*

*Disney has multiple deals with multiple game developers simultaneously. Marvel for example has deals with other game developers like Bethesda in addition to Insomniac. This also includes Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar...etc. All that royalty almost completely goes to their bottom line having only to finance a small staff for licensing.*

.............

***\*Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will leapfrog Sony past their current pillars:***

*Sony allegedly goes into detail about how it views Microsoft's position moving forward. Described by Sony as ""the leapfrog,"" the slide details how Microsoft is aiming to build a mobile gaming store to compete with Apple and Google, as per previous information. It also details how Microsoft could build a comprehensive ecosystem across mobile, PC, and console, referring to Xbox Game Pass as ""GP"" throughout. Sony details how its ""pillars"" are ""dated,"" and behind Microsoft, referring to Microsoft's growing service game portfolio across titles like Sea of Thieves, Halo Infinite, and Minecraft. Sony also notes its need to ""respond,"" although its service game efforts have hit snags recently, with Destiny's upcoming expansion delayed, and The Last of Us Online wholly cancelled.*

..............

***\*Video games have become more and more expensive, similar to films, compelling a change in strategy:***

*Sony details how difficult it's getting to actually get a return on investment for AAA games — an issue that is plaguing the entire industry right now. Sony expresses how a $500 million game might not break even in the first year, which is upending how publishers are thinking about platforms like PC and mobile as they seek profitability and less risky investments.*

*To that end, Sony's ""strategic pillars"" seem to detail an intent to eventually launch games more quickly, or even day one on Windows PCs, as part of its multi-platform pillar.*

Netflix and TKO Group Holdings said Tuesday that the streaming platform will air the WWE’s flagship program Raw starting next year, in Netflix’s first major foray into live sports.

Netflix, which is trying to drive revenue by cutting down on subscription sharing and pushing viewers toward its ad-tier membership, has made few attempts at live programming in its history. Adding Raw, which currently airs on USA Network, to its programming lineup will be a boon to the platform.


Raw is the top program on USA, drawing 17.5 million unique viewers per year, the companies said.

Separately Tuesday, the WWE’s parent company TKO announced actor and former wrestling superstar Dwayne Johnson would join its board of directors.

TKO shares jumped more than 10% in premarket trading following the announcements.",2024-01-23 12:46:24,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806473,37 days 02:43:24.806474,35,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19dnmsy/netflix_to_stream_wwes_raw_starting_next_year_in/
19dmxd0,stocks,Analysis shows surprisingly that the domestic streaming market has room for growth.,"***From ""Fortune"":*** 

*Something weird happened in the streaming market at the end of 2023. For the last two years, the percentage of U.S. households using streaming services has hovered between 80% and 83% each quarter, leading analysts to believe it had reached its peak. But new data from analytics company HarrisX shows that after taking a small dip in the third quarter of 2023, the statistic popped to 85% at the end of last year, raising the tantalizing possibility that there’s more room for growth.*  
  
*“This is counter to our prior narrative that streaming reached a peak in the U.S.,” said analysts at MoffettNathanson, a New York-based media investment firm, in a research report published on Monday.*  
  
*The reason for the uptick in streamers is unclear, though there are many plausible causes: The arrival of lower-cost advertising tiers, Black Friday discounts, and Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown could all have played a role, the analysts said.*  
  
*And while last year’s Hollywood labor union strikes could have led consumers, dismayed by the lack of new shows, to cancel their streaming subscriptions, the opposite could also be true. For certain cable TV subscribers, the delay of new content across the television industry may have provided an excuse to cut the cord and switch to a cheaper streaming plan instead, the analysts theorized.*  
  
*The news comes ahead of quarterly earnings results for the major streaming companies, including Netflix on Tuesday, and Peacock owner Comcast on Thursday. Apple is set to report earnings next week, with other streamers following in February.*  
  
*As the first streaming company to report earnings this year, Netflix will set the tone for what’s to come. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly revenue of $8.71 billion, an 11% increase from the same quarter last year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. They also estimate 8.91 million subscriber additions, beating the 7.7 million added the same quarter last year and just shy of Netflix’s 9 million third quarter addition.*  
  
***Anomalous blip or surprising upside?***  
*American households on average subscribe to four streaming platforms, which has remained consistent over the last two years, according to MoffettNathanson. This lack of growth in recent years means that companies have primarily battled for each other’s customers rather than hunting for newbies – a zero sum game, according to the analysts.*  
  
*Indeed, there has been evidence that streaming fatigue has already hit, with consumers frustrated over hiked prices, increased ads, and decreased quality, Fortune previously reported. And as prices continue to rise and platforms increasingly share content with each other, the number of services each household pays for has the potential to tick back down, analysts reckon.*  
  
*The increase in streaming penetration during the fourth quarter was a positive surprise. But it remains to be seen whether it signals a new opportunity for market growth or a small, anomalous blip in a saturated market. Whatever the case, MoffettNathanson's analysts said in the report, ""streaming ended 2023 with a nice tailwind.""*

19dm3ut,stocks,BLOOMBERG: Chaos in the Red Sea Is Starting to Bite Into Companies’ Profits,"My View -

Red Sea crisis continues to affect many sectors across the world. Diversion via Cape of Good Hope (i.e. skip the faster route via Suez Canal) requires huge supply of oil and other necessities throughout the voyage. The additional cost and time inevitably damage companies' profits as well as pump up inflation.

&#x200B;

**BLOOMBERG: Chaos in the Red Sea Is Starting to Bite Into Companies’ Profits**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact)

*With the Red Sea crisis roiling shipments of everything from cars to energy, it’s only a matter of time before soaring costs and supply-chain strains show up in companies’ earnings reports.*

*Several firms are already warning of the impact. Electric vehicle maker Tesla plans a two-week production halt at a German plant due shipment delays, while Sweden’s Volvocar AB has announced a three-day stoppage at its Belgian factory. British retailers Tesco, Marks & Spencer Group and Next have all flagged the risk of higher prices for consumers.*

*This is due to at least 2,300 ships taking lengthy detours to avoid Houthi militants’ attacks in the Red Sea — a waterway that normally handles over 12% of global sea trade. Central bankers are warning of an inflation surge that could hamper interest-rate cuts. For many companies, especially in Europe, it’s adding to transit times, padding out freight bills and raising insurance costs. It's also forcing analysts to rethink companies’ earnings estimates for the coming year.*

*In the past three months, the consensus forecast for car-makers’ earnings is down 5%, data shows. Shippers on the other hand are emerging as winners — with container rates surging 300% on some routes, earnings estimates for MSCI Europe’s transportation index have risen 7% in just two weeks.*

*Thomas Brenier, head of equities at Lazard Freres Gestion in Paris, has trimmed exposure to the auto sector, seeing it as ""one of the first to suffer due to its complex and tense supply chain.” He is also avoiding retail, as it ""could suffer from a lack of products to sell.”*

*""If it lasts another one or two months, for sure you will see some profit warnings linked to this,” Brenier predicted.*

*Here’s a look at how earnings could shape up for various sectors:*

*1. Shipping and insurance*

*It is estimated that current container shipping costs, if sustained, could add to headline inflation in the U.K. and euro area from late 2024 and early 2025.*

*But the events are boosting the fortunes of global shipping companies, such as AP Moller— Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG in Europe, U.S.-listed ZIM Integrated Shipping and Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines. Insurers should also benefit, with underwriters jacking up premiums tenfold on some shipping routes.*

*Among shippers, Maersk has enjoyed a slew of bullish recommendations. Bank of America recently doubled 2024 earnings estimates for the Danish firm, while Goldman Sachs Group reckons a massive increase in free-cash flow could allow it to return capital to shareholders.*

*David Vernon at Sanford C Bernstein and Co. predicts an earnings boost for logistics firms too, including freight forwarders, if companies that run out of shipping options resort to airfreight.*

*""Air freight are absolutely the winners,” Vernon said, naming FedEx, United Parcel Service and DHL Group as potential beneficiaries.*

*2. Retailers*

*Next, which sources most of its fashion and home products from Asia, was among the first retailers to voice fears of a hit.*

*Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, and Hennes & Mauritz AB are highly exposed to sea freight volumes, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain, while Zara owner Inditex SA sources mostly from nearby countries. Similarly, Bryan Garnier & Co. highlights French furniture retailer Maisons du Monde SA as highly vulnerable, procuring 75% of its goods from Asia and transporting 90% by sea.*

*Prolonged disruption will pull in global brands such as Nike, Adidas AG and Capri Holdings, Bernstein said.*

*The problem for such companies is that the economic backdrop can make it harder to pass higher costs to consumers. ""Companies may have to absorb them, which would crimp profit margins,” Frédérique Carrier at RBC Wealth Management said.*

*3. Autos*

*So far, Tesla and Volvo Car are the only auto makers to announce production stoppages. But such delays ""may represent a fresh risk to light vehicle production this year,” according to Morgan Stanley.*

*However, most reckon the industry won’t see a repeat of COVID-19 era problems. ""Costlier fuel, extra days of space rented, and higher shipping rates are going to be a negative on companies’ P&Ls, but, putting this in perspective, transportation costs are about 57% lower than COVID levels,” BofA analyst John Murphy wrote.*

*The crisis could even allow automakers to maintain higher vehicle prices.*

*4. Energy*

*The impact on crude prices has been relatively muted this year, but that could change if a prolonged conflict causes supply shortfalls.*

*However, oil markets are bracing for weeks-long disruptions. Fewer tankers are traversing the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, according to Vortexa data. The number of ships carrying crude or dirty petroleum products such as fuel oil, have slid by 25% this year up to Friday versus a year earlier, the figures show.*

19dkur1,stocks,India’s Zee Entertainment dives 31% after Sony calls off mega merger,"*Shares of India’s Zee Entertainment*

*fell 31% on Tuesday after a division of Japanese tech giant Sony scrapped plans for a merger. Sony first proposed to combine its India entertainment business with Zee in December 2021. Those negotiations collapsed after more than two years.*

*On Monday, Sony said that it terminated the merger because “among other things, the closing conditions to the Merger were not satisfied” by the agreed closing date.*

19dhkch,stocks,Can someone explain why RBLX stock is still high?,"I was trying to create my own personal valuation on what the stock price of Roblox should be and I can't even make the final number positive. Regardless of whether or not I put in information correctly for the computation, I'm genuinely curious what is driving this stock up.

* Net loss is steady quarter to quarter and the company doesn't expect positive net income in the near future.
* The price to book ratio is at an absurd 191, the highest competitor is below 5.
* Revenue is growing, however it is directly connected to bookings revenue, which is driven from Daily Average Users. At its current trends, this growth is roughly 20%. Based on the growth of expenses compared to revenue, I'm not sure how Roblox will be profitable without somehow growing sales exponentially.
* Recent litigation concerns regarding a class action from shareholders as well as a child safety lawsuit.
* The main positive I see is the amount of cash and not struggling with debt.

Does anyone have any insight as to what would justify this stock being $40? As of right now I'm tempted to buy a lengthy put position after the earnings release. Given the seasonality and strong sentiment for this stock, a bearish position might be cheap after that.

19dg6lh,stocks,How A.I. might improve IT service margins. Here a few stocks on my watchlist.,"Typically, IT services tend to be a very boring industry. There are a lot of sleeper stocks that compound capital with good cash flows. Nothing exciting happens here. They charge a premium to install software for clients in most cases. So naturally, investors tend to look for higher-margin software stocks.

But a few months ago, I remember hearing Chamath mention the impact of A.I. on IT outsourcing. And I don't think this idea has been revisited much. (I know the All-In ideas are controversial but this might be interesting to pick apart.)

First, we're familiar with the big names like IBM, Infosys and Accenture $IBM $INFY $ACN.  
  
Infosys and IBM have mid-teen profit margins with +30% returns on equity. Cognizant $CTSH and Accenture are similar. However I think the market underappreciates smaller players like TaskUs $TASK and RCM $RCMT. Both offer tech outsourcing in different verticals.  
  
TaskUs focuses on content moderation and security. RCM in specialty healthcare and engineering. RCMT is delivering 56% on equity with improving margins after the CEO turned the stock around.  
  
Now I don't think A.I. is priced in most of these IT service stocks. Both as a competitive advantage and disruptor. First up, the big names wont see much margin changes. But mid cap stocks like $CNXN $UIS $CDW might see further margin compression. Making those stocks painful to hold.

But TaskUs has a younger executive team with the cofounders still onboard. They caught the social media content wave early on and outsourced a lot of work to the Philippines. Trust & Safety was a big win for them. They also work in unique verticals like gaming.

I don't think they will pivot to software. But I do think the net profit margins can go beyond 4-5%. A 7% net profit margin is possible if they replace some talent with A.I. software. A 2-3% uptick doesn't seem like much but it's 40-50% higher than their current take rate. The stock price can reflect these margin improvements over the next 2-3 years. It will be slow but profitable.

Other names worth looking into are EPAM Systems $EPAM, Exlservice $EXLS and Genpact $G. All have more focused leadership with good historical performance.

19dg1je,stocks,ADBE monetization of AI tools is terribly thought up,"Does Adobe plan on monetizing (raising prices) on its AI tools?  I've been watching some crazy videos on AI in Photoshop and it's stunning, so initially I was extremely bullish on ADBE, but then after researching their AI pricing, I see a lot of risk.

Pricing for generative AI is included in all their ""creative"" plans by way of credits, 500 credits for the cheapest plan ($20) and 1000 for the most expensive $60 (actually it's unlimited, just slow after using all your credits for the expensive plan, but will be enforced starting March 2024 [and other vague statements by Adobe here).](https://helpx.adobe.com/firefly/using/generative-credits-faq.html).

For the cheap plan adobe says you can just keep buying the $5 plan for 100 more credits, which I doubt many people will do as the smartest thing to do is buy a whole new plan at $20 for 500 credits.

There's several issues with how adobe came up with these pricing plans:

* They don't go into detail on ""enforcing"" limits and I think they'll just end up enraging their customer base in March
* Currently generative AI is free for a few of their plans, just slow after running out of credits, but again, that'll change in March
* You can just create new plans to avoid their terribly priced add-on plan; they should have just priced 1 credit at 4 or 5 cents or had an unlimited pricing plan with a higher limit for extreme users

Adobe revenue is at 19.37B and growth rate around 10%; the last earnings report in December lowered their guidance, so Adobe's own AI estimates internally is probably weak, so I don't really have huge expectations for 2024 for them.

There's a huge risk to Adobe & their Photoshop product in general as you can just give an AI the pic or video and have it re-process the whole thing, so it eliminates photoshop entirely!

So I see adobe's terrible pricing actually alienating their customers and they'll end up going somewhere else.  Midjourney and OpenAI's products for AI art are amazing and there's a dozen other smaller companies, so Adobe needs to get their shit together!",2024-01-23 04:31:15,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806504,37 days 10:58:33.806504,8,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19dg1je/adbe_monetization_of_ai_tools_is_terribly_thought/

* [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)


Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets

https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578

HONG KONG— BYD overtook TSLA as the world’s top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice. 

Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.

BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water—features that turn heads in China’s cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.

Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla’s Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn’t available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.

In China, the world’s biggest EV market, Tesla’s market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD’s popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget. 

Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk’s automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.

BYD also has ambitious export and expansion plans. BYD has topped EV sales charts in Thailand and is quickly rising in markets including Australia and Israel. It is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. Its first chartered cargo ship with a capacity for 7,000 vehicles set sail for Europe this month.

Whether BYD can repeat its home success on the global stage depends on whether it can translate the formula winning over Chinese buyers to international consumers. In the U.S., South Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia are emerging as Tesla’s biggest competition by offering a broader range of vehicles.

Challenges loom large for BYD as Chinese carmakers face pressure on profit margins at home, deal with a subsidy probe in Europe, and remain largely shut out from the U.S., where BYD has long had ambitions to sell passenger EVs. 

Beyond existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese cars, the Inflation Reduction Act will exclude cars made with Chinese components from EV tax credits. For now, the company has been manufacturing and selling buses and trucks in the U.S. Its current strategy is to focus on commercial vehicles in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said. 

**Export ambition**

BYD expects to export 400,000 cars abroad this year, a goal that is achievable, said CMB International analyst Ji Shi. Exports offering higher profit margins are likely to become the next engine of growth for BYD, HSBC analysts wrote in a note earlier this month. 

BYD has yet to make much progress toward its main prize: Europe. BYD is estimated to have sold around 13,000 cars in the European Union last year, far from Tesla’s 270,000, according to figures compiled by data firm GlobalData. 

In China, BYD held almost 12% of the passenger-car market and Tesla under 3% for the first 11 months of last year, according to figures compiled by GlobalData. Tesla was the market leader in electric vehicles four years ago. While Tesla’s Model Y remained the most popular electric car in China last year, BYD claimed half of the nation’s 20 bestselling electric models as it churned out new minivans and sedans.

BYD “has the China market completely covered for the most part,” said Tu Le, consultant at Sino Auto Insights.

This month, Tesla cut prices in China for some versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the latest fluctuation over the past year as carmakers engage in a price war in China. Tesla’s refresh of its Models 3 and Y last year added new features such as ambient interior lighting and a smaller rear screen, features that analysts said were already common among Chinese EVs and might not move the needle for Tesla.  

Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

While Tesla has fended off past challenges from a range of Chinese automakers, BYD’s move upmarket presents drivers with more prestigious homegrown choices over foreign rivals.

A price tag of 150,000 yuan, equivalent to around $21,000, used to be the ceiling customers were thought to be prepared to pay for Chinese-branded vehicles, a BYD executive said. Customers flaunted their status with an imported Western vehicle as there were no Chinese-designed cars priced above a million yuan, BYD sales representatives said.

**Delivery ceremonies**

Yangwang luxury vehicles are sold through direct-sales showrooms separate to BYD. Customers picking up their vehicles are offered a delivery ceremony, complete with balloons and floral decorations for special occasions such as a birthday, marriage proposals or anniversaries. 

Buyers of its hybrid U8 SUV have the car key delivered in a gift box, nested with a miniature of the vehicle. BYD videos show the U8 doing a full 360-degree “tank turn” on the spot, which has garnered a lot of attention on Chinese social media. 

Jin Songchang, a Chinese businessman, was shopping for an off-road SUV to drive across China’s vast provinces once he retires. After months of test driving luxury foreign cars, he finally whipped out a deposit for BYD’s U8, which costs just over $150,000. 

Jin said he was swayed to BYD after company founder Wang Chuanfu said at its launch event that the U8 can run steadily on just three wheels if a tire bursts, thanks to its four powerful in-wheel motors. Jin placed a deposit the next day.

“I’ve always appreciated foreign brands more. BYD is the first one I decided to buy on the spot,” added Jin, who said he owns many cars.

Together with its other two high-end car brands, BYD counted more than 135,500 orders of premium and luxury cars in 2023, according to company data. The U8 SUV will be available in Brazil, the company said last year.  

BYD has yet to open up sales for its supercar, the U9, after it was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show in April. The sports car can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles in two seconds. This month, Yangwang teased its coming luxury sedan.

BYD is following the footsteps of companies such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen with its family of different car brands, analysts say.

“There’s no global automaker that just sells one brand, outside of Tesla,” said Le, the consultant.",2024-01-22 22:45:24,2024-02-29 15:29:48.806519,37 days 16:44:24.806519,19,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19d8szf/a_lamborghinistyle_ev_byd_goes_upmarket_to/

Stock ABC is at 100.

Buy a call debit spread for stock ABC. Say expiration is march 15th. 

Buy a 100$ put and sell a 90$ put (put debit spread) 

Same expiration,

Buy a 90$ call and sell a 100$ call. 

Now the cost will be nearly the same. You will have no gain potential and a max loss of just a few dollars. Then when it gets closer to expiration you close the spread that you think will be worthless.

If you aren’t sure you can let both expire and be around break even?

19d0lmi,stocks,Do REIT's generally have higher returns over 30+ years than the S&P?,"1) 

I Recently read on Investopedia that REIT's have outperformed the S&P over X years. However, i have also read in other places that this is not true at all. I am surpriced that the consensus is so divided. Can anybody explain this? 

2) 

Do any REIT ETF's automatically reinvest dividend? 

3)

Can you recommend any REIT ETF's? I notice that a lot of the REIT ETF's i've seen have a lot of retail property while i was hoping for something with mostly apartments for housing

Granted, Alphabet has more going for it than what the common user interfaces with, but it's that lack of trust on so many levels that has me worried about it being as solid of an investing platform in the future. If a person can't trust it to give unbiased search results, or to allow unbiased discussions or how-to videos (of perfectly legal topics) on its video platform, and if one cannot trust it to cease tracking everything one does - what company or country would be foolish enough to trust its highly sensitive data on Alphabet's servers?

19cpcdr,stocks,Sony sends termination letter to Zee on $10 bln India merger - source,"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Group has sent a termination letter to Zee Entertainment to call off a $10 billion merger of their Indian operations following an impasse over who will lead the combined entity, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday.

The deal was perceived as crucial for the survival of the companies in a highly competitive market, given the impending merger between Disney's Indian businesses and the media assets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries.

Sony cited unmet conditions of the merger agreement as the reason for the termination in a letter sent to Zee early on Monday, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Monday.

The company is expected to disclose the letter to the exchange later, the report added.

Sony declined to comment, while Zee did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

19clo61,stocks,Companies rush to bond market in record $150bn debt splurge.,"Investment-grade companies tap dollar-denominated debt market at fastest year-to-date pace to lock in lower yields.

[Chart of historical issuance](https://i.imgur.com/4NqB7o0.png)

https://www.ft.com/content/20041cec-a83f-4f41-8cf3-b40d3464c922

US corporate bond markets are “on fire” as companies have sold a record $150bn of debt since the start of this month, the busiest opening to the year for more than three decades.

Investment-grade groups have issued $153bn worth of bonds this month, according to data from London Stock Exchange Group, the highest year-to-date figure for dollar-denominated debt in records going back to 1990.

Borrowers are rushing to lock in lower interest costs, while investors are keen to buy new bonds before policymakers start cutting US interest rates later this year.

“The market is just on fire,” said Richard Zogheb, head of global debt capital markets at Citi.

Investors “want to lock in longer-term yields now”, Zogheb said.
Corporate borrowing costs have fallen sharply since financial markets rallied strongly late last year, after the US Federal Reserve signaled that it had completed its campaign of interest rate rises.

Investment-grade yields sit at 5.34 per cent — higher than their levels at the end of last year, but well below their mid-November levels of more than 6 per cent.

The “spread” — or premium — paid by borrowers to issue bonds over the cost of US Treasury yields has shrunk to just 1.01 percentage points, according to Ice BofA index data. This is the lowest level in two years.

The first month of the year is typically busy for new issuance, but bankers and strategists said this month’s particularly strong burst of activity reflected companies rushing to take advantage of that fall in yields.

“It’s a lot cheaper for [issuers] to borrow now than it was just a few months ago,” said Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager at Invesco Fixed Income. “So in that regard, they’re thinking ‘hey, this is a good time to go ahead and do it’.”

More than two-thirds of this month’s borrowing has been by banks and other companies classified as financials by LSEG.
Zogheb pointed to concerns that banks’ regulatory capital requirements could increase. But, he said, “the biggest factor” driving issuance was “just pent-up need to issue paper”. Many companies postponed debt-raising plans last year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Banks that have issued bonds since the start of 2024 include JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, raising $8.5bn, $8bn and $6.75bn respectively.

Non-financial companies tapping lenders include energy group Energy Transfer with a $3bn deal, natural gas producer EQT with a $750mn deal, telecoms company T-Mobile with a $3bn transaction and Canada’s Liberty Utilities with an $850mn offering.

Borrowers may be trying to get ahead of any economic data that could threaten the positive mood, some of those involved in the market said.

“Everybody’s bought into the ‘soft landing’ narrative at this point,” said Maureen O’Connor, global head of Wells Fargo’s high-grade debt syndicate. “It just feels priced for perfection . . . And so I think there are some nerves that there are near-term catalysts for volatility.”

Many finance directors believe it is better to issue debt now rather than risk waiting for further falls in case the market turns.
“No treasurer is going to get fired because he left 10 or 15 basis points on the table,” said one senior banker. “Some treasurer is going to get fired for not financing and then seeing the market shut down for a couple of months.”",2024-01-22 03:07:08,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212241,38 days 12:22:42.212242,58,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19clo61/companies_rush_to_bond_market_in_record_150bn/

19cfilp,stocks,Could 2024 be Disney's year?,"*There's so much noise and the narrative is murky, but the upside is note-worthy;*

   *\*****Streaming****: at $90 it seems like the street is valuing streaming at 0 even though it's 2/3s the size of Netflix and it matches Netflix's revenue just before the pandemic. It showed a healthy growth of 12% shrinking losses by a billion. Pushed by ad revenue, Ampere analytics now predicts profitability as early as Q1 2024. More upside comes from Charter which just added millions of subs to their ad-tier Jan-5 and the India merger where all Jio Cinema subs will be offered Disney+ exclusively in India for 5 years.*

   *\*****Experiences****: their cruises reported a 98% occupancy last quarter; Disney is doubling its capacity in the next two years. Park expansions in Hong Kong & Shanghai are already clocking record attendance. Tokyo's expansion is next summer followed by Paris. In Florida, Disney World surged again this holiday clocking its busiest day since reopening on December 29. Disney started selling Magic Keys ""annual passes"" again a few weeks ago and they were all sold out in hours.*

*\*****Content****: ""it can't get worse"" should suffice, but Disney's upcoming slate is better than that. The best tracking for box office projections is done through pre-sales. If presales aren't open yet, we track it with surveys like* [*Quorum.com*](https://Quorum.com)*. Deadpool3, InsideOut2 & Planet of the Apes are tracking on top of their categories very far from release. Deadpool3, Marvel's next film, is impossible to open <120mil with its rare scores. On streaming as well, it boasts a strong slate; they just announced that Percy Jackson (currently running) clocked 26mil views; that's House of the Dragon-level numbers. Disney should dominate 2023 Nielsen's top streamed films list released in the next two weeks.* 

*Plus the argument that bad content will translate to worse park attendance is a falsehood; Disney's content had a terrible decade in the 2000's but the parks flourished. It doesn't make sense that parents and kids stop going to their parks cause an original animated film that year flopped. That may have an effect in a decade, but not short-term.*

*\*****India Merger****: it's looking more and more certain. It will be a merger of equals with equal representation in the board. Regulatory concerns are allayed by the fact that it's a deal with Mukesh Ambani who's well connected and is a close friend of the prime minister, he's know to get things quickly.*

*\*****ESPN****: is back on a growth curve last quarter in all metrics. If the NFL deal goes through, it's a game changer; Peacock's streaming number for the latest play-off proves that and Disney is best poised for the deal with ESPN/Disney having massive footing in both linear and streamer.* 

  *\*****Technicals****: chart looks to have struck a bottom and it recorded a golden cross.* 

&#x200B;

*Of course,* ***linear networks*** *declining is a major overhang; but it's a secular decline pressuring all media companies. It's to be countered by streaming where Disney is positioned best among all legacy media companies.*

19c5iic,stocks,(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,"""*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*   
  
*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*

*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*   
  
*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*   
  
*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*  
*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*

*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*  
  
*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*

*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*  
  
*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*

*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*  
  
*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*   
  
*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*  
  
*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*  
  
*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*  
  
*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*  
  
*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*  
  
*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*  
  
*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*  
  
*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*  
  
*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*  
  
*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*

19c47a3,stocks,Locking in Profits,"Bit of a long post tl:dr at bottom

I’ll start by saying if you continue to dca into index funds passively per the Bogleheads strategy over the course of 20 years you will be in the money, time in the market beats timing the market. 

We have broken ATH and are at peak euphoria, everyone is piling in, all the articles in major media is bullish, reddit is bullish. This is the time to be contrarian and be cautious, and perhaps consider locking in profits.

Most investors who have been trading have never experienced a prolonged bear market barring the quick covid crash. In the 70s and post 01 crash the market didnt make new ath for a decade. Again if you can continue to dca during this time you will come out ahead. But MANY people dont have the mental fortitude to buy when there is blood in the streets and end up selling the troughs. 

The yield curves inversion is ending, this has historically signaled  recession every time without fail, this time could be different. History doesnt repeat but it does rhyme. The composite manufacturing index hasnt been this negative since GFC. Credit card balances are highest its ever been. 

Last year at start of 23 everyone was calling for recession and crash, we got a big rally. Now the narrative is soft landing and election year boom, when the trade gets crowded thats when danger arises.

There is still juice left to be squeezed out of the market, but the risk to reward is not good here. Consider locking in some profits. No one ever got poor from taking profit. In a MMF you can get close to 5 percent, guaranteed. You always have to consider the equity risk premium, how much downside are you risking for the possible extra return in the stock market?

TL:DR
Take some profits here at the ath, bit more upside from here but spy likely topping around 5000
If we rally past this ill come back and eat my words.",2024-01-21 14:10:14,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212250,39 days 01:19:36.212250,66,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19c47a3/locking_in_profits/
19c1cbn,stocks,As a whole this sub is overly negative on taking profits and building a cash position,"I see a lot of people asking about taking profits during ATHs. And the overwhelming response is without a further thought to talk about the markets often being at ATHs and gambling by timing the market and long charts of the S&P.

I thought it was worth a discussion post to point out that theres much more nuance to it than that. 

For starters not all investors are the same. Some invest using only tax advantages retirement accounts. Some invest using only taxable brokerages. Some invest using both. This is already a fundamental question to determine when someone starts talking about taking profits and building a cash position. 

For taxable brokerages there can be many reasons to lock in profits and sell at ATHs. So the next question really should be about that investors goals and larger financial situation. Do they have losses to offset? Are they using their profits to address another, perhaps more pressing financial need/goal? What percentage of their portfolio are they considering selling and using for a cash position? 

It is also much different selling index funds or ETFs vs single positions. Selling your VOO because it’s at an ATH is much different than selling a single company position that you have made a 200% return on thus far.

So in summary before giving advice or mocking posters for their questions remember it’s always important to ask and understand their situation, their intentions and goals and the specifics of what they are actually proposing",2024-01-21 11:20:42,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212251,39 days 04:09:08.212252,170,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19c1cbn/as_a_whole_this_sub_is_overly_negative_on_taking/

19blb1z,stocks,Drone Technology,"Hi All, first time poster here, so I’m sorry if not correct format. Wondering what peoples’ opinions are on drone technology companies. I know nothing of this industry and only dedicate around 20% of my portfolio to individual stocks. 

But I have become intrigued by the possibility of innumerable applications of drone technology in the future. This first became extremely evident with all the [horrifying and disgusting] footage of the carnage due to offensive drone-dropped ordinance in Ukraine currently. But then I came across a video of drones being used to drop supplies for aid as well as search and rescue. And now I realize the far bigger use case in logistics. I have around a 30 year horizon still and am just curious if anyone has any companies that develop or produce drone tech with plans for large scale applications.

Anyone have any companies/tickers to look into? Mostly just interested in building a small position to grow over time and hopefully capture some outsized returns way down the road when drones may be an absolutely invaluable part of daily human life. Of course this may be lofty but nonetheless I enjoy considering investment ideas that pique my specific interests and keep me engaged (as opposed to my personal standard of 80% boring total market index etfs). 

Thanks and looking forward to the discussion!",2024-01-20 20:40:00,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212256,39 days 18:49:50.212256,38,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19blb1z/drone_technology/
19biirs,stocks,Uber/Lyft doomed with autonomous vehicles?,"I commonly hear of story suggesting that Uber/Lyft would be doomed once fully autonomous cars become mainstream. The reasoning being, Tesla for example, can start their own ride sharing service, putting their own inventory at work.

While there is a good chance of this happening, I do not agree with it. My argument is, it is not scalable to do for a car manufacturer. 

Uber and Lyft have an edge because of its nature of business. They continue to be a gig worker company where people who own autonomous cars put their car at work, just like today, but without a driver. So cars work for owners and Uber simply takes a cut.

19bhell,stocks,How do people manage to wipe out their accounts? Or am I just being delusional,"I’m sorry but I just don’t see it. I just don’t see how you can be that dumb. Like I wanna know for my self if people are just dumb or if I’m being delusional. I’m not trying to be mean but come on. I’m a VERY emotional person. I got scammed 5k and nearly lost my mind. People are scared to trade because of the stupidity they hear about trading and how it’s so hard and they lost all this money in not even in 5 years, in ONE year. How can you be that dumb ? Like fine your 40k is now 10kafter 4 years of experience, but how the HELL did you manage to do that in 1 year?


But seriously, what causes that? The way I’m thinking, is 

1. Pick decent stocks, not risky penny stocks or stupid shit like that

2. Take decent profits and don’t push it (unless you are investing longer than a year in a reputable company)

3. Diversify your portfolio

4. Trade based on your capital (if your capital is $10k, don’t put fucking $6k in one stock you barely have any room for the 2% limit if it goes down)

5. Know when to actually sell a stock so if you can risk 200 on a trade, don’t just suddenly freak out and sell all your stocks when they are all $100 down. Maybe the market is down

6. Play around and risk very little at first to get used to the market

7. Get something some kind of software that analyzes stocks and recommends stocks

8. Fucking control your emotions. Which is why you trade with very little at first. You won’t freak out being $5 down but you will when you’re $500. 

9. Don’t ever be an idiot and gamble. If you’re gambling with stocks, then accept the fact that you’re gambling, not trading so you won’t be mad when you lose all your money

10. Stop thinking you can turn this into a full time job in a couple weeks. Start with small profits as a side hustle

Yeah there’s technical analysis and all, which you should learn as you trade. But realistically, if you just shut the fuck to for a couple minutes and thought realistically, you’d be fine. SO many stocks can make you money. But you choose to be risky and emotional. Don’t just sell right away at any loss. But also, accept when you just have to take a loss instead of holding on to hope and risking more. And don’t risk and gamble. And take profits, even small ones. Stop expecting to double you’re $1000 and start taking 5% $50 profits because with the little knowledge you have, you’ll get excited, and be scared to sell, then it’ll crash and you’ll lose your money. Now imagine if you just sold at 5% and made your $50 on every trade!

Successful people focus on minimizing losses, not chasing gains at least at first. 

Also I’m an idiot who’s still learning. Right when I start feeling cocky, I humble myself because it’s embarrassing to be all cocky then lose a ton of money the next day. I guess I made this post for my self. To give my self hope. Im sick of hearing how trading is soooooo hard when in reality people freak out and turn their 50k to 5k In a year. Now if you minimized your losses, maybe you would’ve lost 5k and learned something.

Oh and don’t day trade thinking you can become a day trader and make $100 a day in a couple weeks . THAT is hard. Maybe, be more realistic with the stock market?

19be9in,stocks,Why are there not huge swings in prices for companies on the edge of the S&P 500?,"Wouldn't a company making it into the top 500 most-valued lead to a surge in demand from all the brokerage firms whose customers have shares of S&P 500 index funds?

My understanding is that when I buy index funds, the brokerage firm (Fidelity, in my case) is buying the stocks that make up that fund. So when a new company enters the S&P 500, wouldn't Fidelity have to buy new stock in that company to match the investments of all of their customers who hold S&P 500 funds? And wouldn't that lead to an enormous surge in demand for a company's stock when they enter the top 500, and similarly a huge sell-off for a company if they drop out of the top 500?

19b8ab4,stocks,Setting stop loss at gained profits methodology,"Hello guys

I use to bet on various stocks that happen around the energy sector and are cheap, so I can buy various shares/units. However, once continuous growth happen and my P/L shows some substantial gains, I tend to set an stop loss near those gains, so in case the stock goes bearish, I get the money.

Is this a good approach, in which I never lose profits? Or it is a bad one because I lose the potential of holding more units that I got before the price rose, and maybe the decline was temporarily before going bullish again?

Also, there is a name for this type of methodology?

The option value at this time at the time market closed was $0.42 but stock got up after market. At this time, the stock price is $426, my options on webull show it is ITM, my DNE check is OFF but I do not have sufficient balance of $85K in my account (but I do have around $35K cash).  


What will happen to my ITM expired contract in my cash webull account? The intrinsic value of my ITM option (strike $425) at stock price $426 is going to be $1. Can I assume that because I do not have any cash balance in my account, and the option expired ITM, Webull will auto-liquidate the options at $1?

19au3bn,stocks,"S&P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates","The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.

The S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.

All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.

Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.

But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.

""In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.

Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 ""is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,"" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.

""Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that,"" Stucky added.

Fresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.

Insurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.

Around 8 months after covid related crash, I first time referred the default screeners provided (free) on Yahoo Finance. I decided to track those.

**Note - i didn't buy, I just added to my watch list to track it over time.**

While the ATH could still be high for many of these, the screener seem to have picked up some good winners.

Now, it's true that most stocks rebounded from their covid (march 2020) lows, this was added in **Jan** **2021**, when SPY already had made new ATH after covid lows. and these screener stocks appear to have survived the last year's crash.

Anyone else has similar experience with these Yahoo screeners ? What do you think of the current list of stocks shown there --> [https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/predefined/undervalued\_growth\_stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/predefined/undervalued_growth_stocks)  Do you think any of the current stocks there hold similar potential ?

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/19/consumer-sentiment-surges-while-inflation-outlook-dips-university-of-michigan-survey-shows.html

Consumers have grown more confident about the direction of the economy and inflation at onset of 2024, despite persistent worries about a looming slowdown, a survey released Friday showed.

The University of Michigan’s Consumer Survey of Consumers showed a reading of 78.8 for January, its highest level since July 2021 and up 21.4% from a year ago. That followed a big jump in December and comes despite public opinion surveys showing concern about the nation’s direction.

On a two-month basis, sentiment showed its largest increase since 1991, said Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director.

“Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,” Hsu said. “Democrats and Republicans alike showed their most favorable readings since summer of 2021. Sentiment has now risen nearly 60% above the all-time low measured in June of 2022 and is likely to provide some positive momentum for the economy.”

Along with the improved outlook on general conditions, survey respondents displayed more confidence that inflation is coming down.

The outlook for the inflation rate a year from now declined to 2.9%, down from 3.1% in December for the lowest reading since December 2020. The Federal Reserve has boosted short-term interest rates to their highest level in more than 22 years and inflation has followed suit lower, though it remains above the central bank’s 2% target.

At the same time, the survey’s index of current conditions also leaped higher, rising to 83.3, or 21.6% higher than a year ago.

Consumer sentiment has improved amid a drop in gasoline prices and solid stock market gains. The price at the pump for a gallon of regular gas is about 30 cents lower than it was a year ago, according to AAA, and the S&P 500 is near a record high.

The survey is “another sign that the economy is on track for a soft landing,” said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief economist at Capital Economics. However, he noted that such surveys don’t always feed through to consumer behavior.

Stocks rose slightly following the release while Treasury yields also were higher.

Market have been tethered to expectations for where the Fed will take interest rates this year. The prevailing outlook is for a series of up to six quarter percentage point cuts this year. But the timing of those cuts is unclear, with market pricing now pointing to a tossup as to whether the Fed eases in March or waits until May.",2024-01-19 15:46:41,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212283,40 days 23:43:09.212283,59,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19am1j7/consumer_sentiment_surges_while_inflation_outlook/

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**",2024-01-19 15:17:07,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212285,41 days 00:12:43.212285,137,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19aldt3/amzns_irbt_acquisition_blocked/

19ajvu9,stocks,Goldman Sachs Research Forecast: Rate cuts are coming this year,"
Global core inflation picked up to an estimated one-month annualized rate of 2.6% in December, from the rock-bottom 1.2% reading in November (averaged across early hikers in emerging markets and the G10, excluding Japan).

However, Goldman Sachs Research still thinks inflation is improving. The three-month annualized rate fell further to an estimated 2% in December. The adjustment in core goods prices is far from complete — for example, US used cars have only unwound 31% of their Covid-related price increase. And our economists expect both service inflation and wage growth to continue slowing gradually in a lagged response to the improved supply / demand balance across the global economy.

The US has been a key part of the global decline in inflation, and the country's labor market is continuing to rebalance. Goldman Sachs Research therefore expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates soon, most likely in March. Our economists are forecasting five cuts this year, which is below the six to seven cuts reflected in financial markets. By comparison, only 9% of clients expect the first rate cut in the first quarter of this year, according to a poll this week at Goldman Sachs's Global Strategy Conference in London.",2024-01-19 14:06:49,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212288,41 days 01:23:01.212288,52,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19ajvu9/goldman_sachs_research_forecast_rate_cuts_are/

Overall, for revenue, I took into account how SBUX has to maintain its luxury good status and keep its prices elevated. This leaves SBUX room to expand mainly into wealthier countries. Management has stated that China has the largest potential, with China coming in second for the number of SBUX outlets opened ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/306915/countries-with-the-largest-number-of-starbucks-stores-worldwide/)).

When forecasting the number of stores open, as SBUX is seen as a luxury good this may limit its expansion into the different tier cities of China or to any less wealthy country. SBUX doesn’t compete on price but rather on the experience of coffee, so their strategy to grow revenue is unlikely to include price cutting.

\[[INSERT](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1302245/china-breakdown-of-starbucks-stores-by-city-tier/)\]

As evidence of this, 86% of the stores SBUX operates in are in Tier 1 & 2 Cities in China. SBUX is only opening stores in prosperous cities in line with its brand image of being a premium brand. 

I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast, the main growth came from SBUX expanding its footprints in wealthier countries. Thereafter, SBUX’s main growth driver comes from developing countries. Looking at the top 25 fastest developing countries GDP growth rate as of 2023 ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-fastest-growing-economies-world-140701215.html)). The Median is 6.20%, Average is 10.47%.   
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Operated Stores, I assume that SBUX’s ability to generate revenue was in line with the macroenvironment. I assume that the macroenvironment takes 3 years to restart growth. As the macro conditions lighten up, SBUX begins having a larger ticket and transaction volume.  
  
When forecasting the Number of Licensed stores, I took into account the %of total stores that are owned directly by SBUX. This ratio remained consistent from FY19 to FY23 and this ratio is important as SBUX wants to maintain >50% control as a way of ensuring quality control globally through directly owning and operating the majority of operations of SBUX around the globe. The %begins tapering downwards over time as a better macro environment will encourage SBUX to pursue more aggressive growth plans through franchising.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Licensed Stores, I assumed Y/Y growth as an average %of the historic rate before it begins to half as SBUX in recent years experienced large Y/Y growth from closing less profitable stores globally, and over time SBUX would figure out how best to monetize their licensed stores.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS and others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a %revenue based on historic averages.  
  
When forecasting store operating expenses, when SBUX increased its store count I assumed that there was some inefficiency that would get resolved over time, and on top of that as SBUX gets more efficient and franchise takes up a larger %of total store count, store operating expense which is a fixed cost begins declining.   
  
When forecasting G&A, SBUX tailors each store to cater to SBUX’s premium image. This image requires humans to upkeep, requiring human baristas to give the image of handcrafted coffee rather than a mechanized coffee machine that can be easily replicated and mass-produced. As evidence, when SBUX tried rolling out coffee machines to their stores it led to a decline in revenue as the SBUX experience was worsened. So, I assumed that G&A remains a %of historic averages for SBUX to maintain its minimum headcount for each store.

# CapEX and D&A:

When forecasting D&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted D&A as a %of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting CapEX, I accounted for how much %earnings SBUX had historically reinvested and their %ROIC. ([SOURCE](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/SBUX/ROIC-Percentage/SBUX)) Assuming that SBUX has a higher ROIC over time due to its improving brand premium and more profitable franchise arm.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.03%  
RFR = 4.03%  
US ERP = 4.60%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX/)) = 0.98

WACC = 7.38%

# Conclusion:

In my base case, I value SBUX at $87.09 per share. I believe that SBUX is more or less correctly priced with some momentum carried over from them beating their earnings previous quarter. I believe that SBUX is a strong brand name. However, for consumables like coffee, the ability to reinvest back into R&D and differentiate themselves from competitors is rather limited. With factors such as taste and aesthetics being highly subjective to the consumer or even being similar to their competitors. SBUX's management recognises their limited ability to reinvest and create results, so instead of destroying value by forcing reinvestments, they have decided to pay it out as dividends instead. This limited ability to reinvest has led to SBUX being properly priced by the market.

19ahs06,stocks,Amazon’s AWS Plans $15 Billion Cloud Investment in Japan.,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-stock-aws-cloud-ai-japan-9ba095f7

Amazon’s cloud ambitions are going global.

Amazon Web Services said Friday it will invest 2.3 trillion yen ($15 billion) in Japan by 2027 to expand its cloud infrastructure in Tokyo and Osaka to meet growing demand.

Japan has lagged behind in its generative artificial intelligence development but the government, and its tech companies, are battling to catch up.

Amazon is happy to help, and in the process expand its global footprint.

In May last year, the tech giant’s cloud unit pledged to invest $12.7 billion in India by 2030, again to meet growing demand for cloud services. That long-term commitment will take AWS’s total investment in India to $16.4 billion after it funded the launch of two data infrastructure regions in Mumbai and Hyderabad between 2016 and 2022.

Its Japanese endeavors have followed a similar blueprint, launching in Tokyo and 2011 and Osaka in 2021 before embarking on a major expansion in the years ahead.

Amazon previously said its 1.51 trillion yen cloud investment in Japan between 2011 and 2022 contributed 1.31 trillion yen in gross domestic product to the Japanese economy.

AWS’ cloud operations are now present in 12 regions in Asia Pacific and China—Hong Kong, Melbourne, Mumbai, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Ningxia, Jakarta and Hyderabad, according to the company’s website.",2024-01-19 12:15:27,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212293,41 days 03:14:23.212293,11,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19ahs06/amazons_aws_plans_15_billion_cloud_investment_in/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

19a8vwc,stocks,Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is a great book that explains how our brains trick us into making bad investing decisions,"  
Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is a great book that explains how our brains trick us into making bad money decisions.  


Loss aversion is a key concept discussed in the book.  


Loss aversion helps explain why we hold onto losing investments way longer than we should.  


We feel the pain of losses more than the pleasure of gains, so we might make irrational decisions to avoid losses.  


Losing $100 feels twice as bad as gaining $100. And because the pain of losing something is stronger than the pleasure of gaining the same thing, this can lead to irrational decision-making.  


The book also discusses the concept of attitude to risk, which is influenced by loss aversion.   


We tend to be risk-averse when it comes to gains, but risk-seeking when it comes to losses.   


This can lead to our holding onto losing stocks in the hope that they will bounce back, rather than selling them and realizing a loss.  


I recommend this book to anyone looking to level up their mindset and psychology around investing.  


Key lesson: Never let your emotions dictate your money decisions.

Do you think it's important to understand the psychological factors that influence our decision-making processes?",2024-01-19 03:03:44,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212295,41 days 12:26:06.212296,13,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19a8vwc/thinking_fast_and_slow_by_daniel_kahneman_is_a/
19a7tit,stocks,We are 5y to 10y away from global EV adoption mandate deadlines. Is now a good time to be bullish on lithium stocks while they’re cheap?,"There’s no denying that we’re not too far away from a policy driven EV adoption wave of massive proportions. All the top global car markets are very much aligned on this:

**China - Biggest car market:** The Chinese government has implemented a quota system to limit the number of gasoline-powered cars sold in the country.

**US - Second biggest car market:** This rollout will likely happen state by state (California’s EV mandate is leading the pack). On a federal level, Biden's EPA wants to enact a mandate that will push for two-thirds of all new vehicles to be electric by 2032.

**EU - Third biggest car market:** The EU has the strictest EV adoption goals with all new cars and vans registered set to be zero emission by 2035.

Japan, Indian, Canada, UK, and 80 more countries are also implementing aggressive EV adoption mandates all set on meeting a 2030 - 2035 deadline.

Like many things macro, the global adoption curve will be initially incremental with a very sharp turn appearing outta nowhere around the halfway point. I’m betting that it will take place around 2027 - 2030. A few things that strengthen this hypothesis: 

1.  Global relations and supply chain deterioration as a result of regional conflict, brics, etc.
2.  Countries are finally investing on sovereign energy assets to mitigate 3rd party risk (Russia, Saudi, etc).
3. Institutional, public and private capital incentives (grants for charging infrastructure, tax perks, etc).

Does that mean that I’m going Yolo on EV automakers? No, not for a while at least - they have a tough hill to climb (R&D costs, retail saturation, infra costs, the list goes on).

I prefer to make calculated plays with ironclad lithium exploration, drilling and refining stocks.The lithium industry is going through an aggressive m&a phase because they know that the majority of all deposits just aren’t viable exploration plays (geographical conundrums, costs, environmental compliance…just too much red tape).

In regards to alternatives like nuclear, thorium, sodium ion, hydrogen are either stuck in bureaucratic quagmires or their just liquidity trap hyped shenanigans.

Anyhow, I’m stacking up on lithium mining stocks . Do you have any cool lithium plays on your watchlist or portfolio?

19a67ll,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/zuckerberg-meta-nvidia-gpu-b0632fed

On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.

“Our long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” he wrote in the post. “We’re building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap” for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta’s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.

Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ’s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.

A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.

Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta’s H100 purchases.

The H100 is Nvidia’s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.

Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

* The total on hand for exchange-traded funds and notes, along with passively managed mutual funds, totaled $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging higher than the $13.23 trillion held in actively managed funds, according to Morningstar.
* That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks.


Passive investment products have long been pulling in the lion’s share of money from investors, but as 2023 came to a close they achieved a milestone: holding more assets than their actively managed counterparts.

The total assets under management in exchange-traded funds and notes along with passively managed mutual funds reached a combined $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging above the $13.23 trillion held in active assets, according to Morningstar.

While passively managed stock funds long ago took the lead, this was the first time that passively managed products surpassed active across all asset classes combined.

“It’s been a long time coming,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and one of Wall Street’s closest trackers of the ETF industry since it first started drawing investor attention. “Last year with equities it was a very difficult year for active outperformance. ... It was a year when you had an initial burst of enthusiasm for a few months, then a pullback and then a rush at the end. Kind of a nightmare scenario for an active manager.”

Indeed, just in large-cap blended funds alone, passive funds raked in a net $192.8 billion for the year while active funds lost $48.6 billion, Morningstar reported. Large-cap growth funds saw a net $38.3 billion move to passive funds while active lost $91.2 billion.

That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks, down from 47% in 2022 although around the long-term average, according to Bank of America.

In contrast, passive funds, which primarily track market indexes such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, had a strong year thanks to a big performance from the broader market. The S&P 500 alone had a 24% return for the year.

“You had to be right there when the liftoff happened going into November and December,” Colas said. “In many ways, it was the hardest possible environment for active managers to keep their cool, stay focused and not get overly optimistic or pessimistic.”

Adding to the challenges was the performance of the “Magnificent 7” tech-centric stocks — Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta and Amazon

— which carried most of the weight for the market. The Nasdaq 100, which is weighted toward technology, exploded 55% higher last year on a total return basis.

“You had this remarkable market leadership in Big Tech and some managers can’t own it because of mandates or a reluctance to have 25%-plus of their portfolio in a handful of names,” Colas said.

Still, there could be hope ahead for active management if market conditions change in 2024.

“As far as what a stock-pickers market looks like, it’s basically a low-volatility, low-correlation market without a lot of drawdowns that instill fear into money managers and force them to sell at the bottom,” Colas said. “This could be that kind of year.”",2024-01-18 19:27:55,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212303,41 days 20:01:55.212303,6,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/199yf7f/in_2023_just_38_of_largecap_active_funds/

**Question:**

The author's point was Spotify is growing like crazy but that's not enough - it doesn't have enough leverage with the artists/labels to build a meaningfully profitable business.

What do you all think?

Seems crazy to me that this level of growth isn't going to translate into something big down the road.

199ttbu,stocks,WSJ - The $8.8 Trillion Cash Pile That Has Stock-Market Bulls Salivating,"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-8-8-trillion-cash-pile-that-has-stock-market-bulls-salivating-0a1b4a8c

Wall Street wants your money off the sidelines.

Rising interest rates drew trillions of dollars into money-market funds and other cash-like investments in the past two years, with more than $8.8 trillion parked in money funds and CDs as of the third quarter of 2023. Investors are optimistic that with rates poised to fall, people will redirect that money and fuel markets’ next leg higher.

Vivek Trivedi, 37 years old, a pharmacist in Indianapolis, has around $80,000, or a bit more than 10% of his overall assets, in money-market funds and inflation-adjusted U.S. savings bonds (I bonds). He plans to eventually use that cash to buy a rental property but would consider investing it in blue-chip stocks in the meantime should interest rates fall and render yields less attractive.

“Every month, I’m looking at inflation,” he said. “If I’m not earning at least 1.5% more than inflation, I have to think about different strategies.”

What Trivedi and others decide is key to what happens next in markets. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year spurred big rallies at the end of 2023, driving major indexes near records. That heat is beginning to dissipate. Some investors say markets have little room for further gains and are already priced for a perfect scenario, in which inflation moderates without significant job losses.

Wall Street is pinning its hopes on cash moving from money-market funds to provide the next big boost. Rates above 5% were flashy after years of safe investments offering little interest. Their fall could drive investors to U.S. stocks, which have historically provided the highest returns in the long run. 

Bond yields have declined from their peaks, but rates offered on Wall Street remain high relative to recent history, pulling cash toward money-market funds. Stocks also still look expensive, meaning bargain hunters might find rates on CDs more alluring than playing the market—for now.

“The assets in money-market funds are staggering,” said Randy Gwirtzman, a portfolio manager at Baron Capital. “All that dry powder is on the sidelines and waiting to invest.” 

Elizabeth Cathcart, 26, works in corporate finance at an investment firm in Denver. She says the math of homeownership has risen so much that without an aggressive investment strategy, it will be unattainable. 

“It’s hard to pass up CDs over 5.5%, particularly for seven months. That’s not a bad deal,” said Cathcart. “But 12 months or longer, I don’t want to lock away cash for that long. I’m young, I want to take more risk.”

Expectations for cash to pour into the market once rates fall may prove overly optimistic, however. Money-market funds raked in cash during previous Fed-tightening cycles but didn’t hemorrhage it when the central bank began to ease. Assets retreated from their peaks, but still plateaued at much higher levels.

Investors also tend to tap money markets during periods of market stress, not necessarily when yields are higher. Assets in money funds peaked at nearly half of the overall money supply in 2008. There was a similar spike in 2001, the aftermath of the dot-com bubble.

Francisco Pena, 30, a data scientist in New York City, said he is using short-term Treasurys, CDs and I bonds as a temporary home for his money. He is saving for a down payment with his husband.

“I didn’t want my cash sitting in a bank account, losing real purchasing power—especially with inflation on the rise,” said Pena. If rates fell substantially, he would stick with a high-yield savings account to keep his cash at the ready.

There is some debate over how much of the assets in cash-like products should be thought of as investments, with potential to enter other parts of the market, versus as bank deposits to be saved or spent later on. Total deposits at U.S. lenders have fallen to $17.4 trillion from a peak of $18.2 trillion since the Fed began tightening policy in early 2022.

The path of interest rates will affect how much money is pulled from fixed-income products. In the past, rate cuts have often been large and rapid, aimed at stemming a crisis. Wall Street foresees a smoother glide path this time around, with rates ending up much higher than near zero, where they sat for years. Traders’ base case is for the federal-funds rate to remain above 3% in the coming years. Fed officials expect the benchmark rate to decline to 2.9% by the end of 2026.

Mark Wiggins, 27, a management consultant living in Miami Beach, Fla., is currently stashing 17% of his income in a high-interest savings account earning 4.4%. Another 13% goes into his 401(k). When rates were lower, he would invest a percentage of his paycheck directly into stocks and crypto. He is planning to invest a significant chunk of his savings. 

“If rates fall below 3.5%, I would probably cut the amount I’m putting into my savings and instead direct deposit to my investment brokerage or crypto,” he said.",2024-01-18 16:17:54,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212306,41 days 23:11:56.212306,74,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/199ttbu/wsj_the_88_trillion_cash_pile_that_has/

2) Reddit subs such as WSB pump up the stock, turning the platform itself into a meme stock in an ironic new form of decentralized market manipulation

3) regulatory scrutiny increases as aggressive ad targeting leads to market instability. Mod content filtering receives increased scrutiny and as a result, content becomes either farther right leaning (X) or self enforcing echo chambers for foreign adversary interference (going into 2024 election)

1999pnk,stocks,What market trends are you BULLISH on in 2024?,"Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard 

**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**

 The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

  
**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**

 Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. 

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )** 

The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

Is there no way to give Elon the extra ""control"" (voting power), without diluting shareholders? If not, then it means that he IS asking to dilute shareholders.

1997yib,stocks,Micron (MU) is worth buying.,"**MICRON: (MU) Buy, Semiconductors Cyclical - Memory $82.50**

I bought more Micron with a 2-3 Years perspective.

Micron, one the largest semiconductor memory suppliers in the world along with SK Hynix and Samsung is a cyclical often subject to over supply and lower pricing of Memory DRAM and NAND chips. It should get a major boost from Generative AI opportunities, which need 5-6 times more memory than traditional applications.DRAM and NAND pricing has shot up higher and faster than any outlet has expected, which is attributed to historically low contract prices, which have motivated buyers to stock up, maintaining robust demand even as prices head upward. 

Since the second half of 2023, however, a combination of production cuts by chip giants like Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., coupled with the gradual depletion of excess inventory, has fueled a price rebound.Management had this to say on its last earnings call - “We expect supply-demand balance to tighten in both DRAM and NAND throughout 2024. Our leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes are oversubscribed for the full year.”

It has already moved up from its low of $48 to $82. I did recommend and buy it in June at $66, but I still believe it’s worth getting into.

When I first bought it around $66, I expected a 50-60% bump over the cycle of two years, and was pleasantly surprised to see it shoot up to $88 so fast.

\- Lets the cals get assigned (and pay a huge amount of tax - might be in vain if we don't end up buying a home)

* Sentiment is now at the highest level since September.
* The increase coincides with a big drop in mortgage interest rates.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/17/january-homebuilder-sentiment-improves.html

Homebuilder sentiment improved in January, jumping 7 points to 44 on the National Association of Home Builders monthly index. Anything below 50 is still considered negative, but the index has now moved 10 points higher in the last two months.

Sentiment is now at the highest level since September.

The increase coincides with a big drop in mortgage interest rates from around 8% in mid-October to the 6% range in December. Builders point squarely to that, and the effect on affordability, for growing confidence.

“Lower interest rates improved housing affordability conditions this past month, bringing some buyers back into the market after being sidelined in the fall by higher borrowing costs,” said Alicia Huey, NAHB chairman and a custom home builder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama. “Single-family starts are expected to grow in 2024, adding much needed inventory to the market. However, builders will face growing challenges with building material cost and availability, as well as lot supply.”

Of the index’s three components, current sales conditions increased 7 points to 48, sales expectations in the next six months jumped 12 points to 57 and buyer traffic rose 5 points to 29.

Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder confidence increased the most in the Northeast, the only area now in positive territory at 55. Sentiment was flat in the Midwest and rose slightly in the South and West.",2024-01-17 15:04:50,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212324,43 days 00:25:00.212324,6,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/198yls9/homebuilder_sentiment_improves_for_second/

**JBLU/SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- We saw SAVE make a MASSIVE, 60%+ move to the downside after the merger was rejected. We could see this fall further, because there really is no path to profitability for SAVE at this point. Hesitant about playing this for a long-term bounce, more interested in short-term day trades. Multiple down-grades on SAVE because of failure of merger.  
  
**NVDA**, liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- still short a small starter position from Thursday, but will possibly get out. Still watching this seeing the recent spike up/down. Added to small short this morning but not extremely confident this will move as intended.  
BFRG, liquidity 8/10- Collaboration with lab for brain development has potentially “ground-breaking data”. Pretty badly written fluff headline but I expect this to move, liquidity is solid.  
  
**TSP**, liquidity 5/10- Going to be delisted off the NASDAQ, likely going to happen. Low market cap, crappy stock, but might play lightly if the move gets huge/volume comes in.   
  
**SLDP**, liquidity 8/10- Solid Power and SK have three new agreements, seeing steady move downwards after initial pop. Worth playing if move becomes larger ($1 level potentially).

It doesn’t make sense. PE ratio is good, and it’s the second largest in the world in car sales.

You could say sales are declining, but so does Ford’s (even more), but it didn’t tank that much.

They keep manufacturing a very diversified range of cars from cheap boring to supercars (indirectly through child brands, but still), and even though its sales isn’t expected to be growing as much as Tesla, but comparing the two is still a joke, and in my opinion Tesla will never be even close to sales of Volkswagen. Still, Tesla’s valuation is 10x Volkswagens.

I don’t mean to start comparing the two, and soon it won’t even be relevant as Tesla is not an automobile only company, but let’s be honest - electric, and self driving cars becoming less and less exotic. Volkswagen is quick to adapt, and pick up latest technologies to put in their cars and sell them for cheap. They provide good price value ratio, and for most people that’s what counts.

I don’t plan on taking any positions but I thought it was a very interesting case study in what can go wrong when you attempt to take advantage of arbitrage plays when a merger/buyout occurs. 

Looking at their financials SAVE is hard to justify even their now current valuation of ~$900mm. Their operating expenses are 20% higher than their gross profit and they effectively lose nearly a quarter billion dollars on an annual basis. But the prospect of a buyout deal at $33/share sent the stock price skyrocketing. The big issue is that the entirety of those gains rested on the deal going through. I have no doubt that some people made good money over the last 6 months or so but I’m also sure plenty of people’s hearts were in their throats seeing the plunge yesterday.

A federal judge blocked JetBlue Airways purchase of budget rival Spirit Airlines, a major win for Biden’s Justice Department, which sued to stop the merger, alleging it would drive up fares for some of the most price-sensitive consumers.  
  
JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion purchase of discounter Spirit would have produced the country’s fifth-largest airline, a deal the carriers said would help them better grow and compete against larger rivals like Delta and United.  
  
The decision, handed down Tuesday by a federal judge in Boston, marks a victory for a Justice Department that has aggressively sought to block deals it views as anticompetitive.  
  
“JetBlue’s plan would eliminate the unique competition that Spirit provides—and about half of all ultra-low-cost airline seats in the industry—and leave tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer options,” the Justice Department alleged in its lawsuit in March.  
  
Spirit shares plunged after the decision was announced and were down 60%, while JetBlue shares swung between gains and losses.  
  
Neither airline immediately commented on the decision.

JetBlue has said access to Spirit’s similar fleet of Airbus planes would allow it to grow quickly when planes and pilots are in short supply, growth it argues it needs to compete against bigger airlines. Years of previous consolidation left United, Delta, American and Southwest in control of about three-quarters of domestic market.  
  
The decision leaves New York-based JetBlue grappling with next steps, tasking incoming CEO Joanna Geraghty with steering the airline on a new path. Geraghty was announced as successor to CEO Robin Hayes after he said earlier this month that he would retire.  
  
The airline operates in highly congested airspace in New York and other cities, and had planned to use Spirit as a way to gain access to more routes and travelers.  
  
JetBlue planned to remodel Spirit’s yellow planes by removing the branding and seats from the tightly-packed planes to provide more of a full-service model.  
  
Spirit had grown rapidly in recent years by offering cheap fares and fees for everything else from seat assignments to carry-on luggage.

1988wg9,stocks,Insight for interest rate movements in 1H2024,"Having time to listen to the webcast ([https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-conversation-with-federal-reserve-governor-christopher-waller](https://www.brookings.edu/events/a-conversation-with-federal-reserve-governor-christopher-waller)) this afternoon, it is believed that FOMC **will not follow** the market expectation to lower interest rates 6 times in 2024, even the market is still **demanding** for 3 interest rate cuts in 1H2024.

Waller explicitly mentioned that the job data tended to be revised downward for most of 2023 - which is in fact saying that even the data is suggesting a rate cut, he will prefer to wait for another month to confirm.

Consider the voting members in 2024 would be generally hawkish, trust that FOMC will keep waiting in 1Q2024, hence the market's dream will not come true ......

**Almost as Good as It Gets…But Will It Last? (Christopher J. Waller, 16 January 2024)**

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240116a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240116a.htm)

*The unemployment rate in December held steady at 3.7 percent while employers added 216,000 jobs, which was more than expected and an increase from the 173,000 created in November and 105,000 in October. While that looks like a modest acceleration in job creation, I remind myself that revisions to monthly payrolls have been downward for most of 2023—from the first to the third estimate employment gains were revised down in 9 of 10 job reports. Given this recent history of revisions, there is a good chance December will be revised down. Furthermore, with growth expectations moderating over coming quarters, employment gains are likely to slow. We can see that this is already happening if we look at progress over the previous quarters. Average monthly payroll gains over the fourth quarter were 165,000, a step down from the 221,000 average in the third quarter and 257,000 in the first half of 2023. This data shows an improving balance between labor supply and demand.*

*As long as inflation doesn't rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year. This view is consistent with the FOMC's economic projections in December, in which the median projection was three 25-basis-point cuts in 2024. Clearly, the timing of cuts and the actual number of cuts in 2024 will depend on the incoming data. Risks that would delay or dampen my expectation for cuts this year are that economic activity that seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does not play out; that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which improved over 2023, stops improving or reverses; and that the gains on moderating inflation evaporate.*

 I feel like the spot bitcoin ETFs are the safest plays since the bitcoin miners need Bitcoin to perform well, but bitcoin doesn’t need any particular miner to do well in the future.

  
But I have this feeling that the higher risk with the bitcoin miners could result in greater percentage gains with the laws of risk/return

19875yx,stocks,"Apple Vision Pro's smart marketing: <80k units will be available, but Apple stores will host free 25-min demos to anyone, 1st-come-1st-serve","***(Nasdaq, Benzinga January-14) Apple Preps 'Most Sophisticated Sales Pitch Ever' For Vision Pro On Feb. 2 With Demos Lasting 25 Minutes in Apple stores for anyone:*** *Apple Vision Pro Preorders begin* ***Jan-19,*** *but the MR headset will pose one of the toughest marketing challenges. Marketing Challenge: Apple has priced the Vision Pro, which has ”limited battery life, an unwieldy design and no killer app,” at* ***$3,499***, *Gurman said in the* *weekly Power On newsletter*.

*The company is bracing for an initial sales surge, courtesy of the early adopters, followed by a tapering off of demand, he said, adding that retail stores may need twice as much inventory space “during the opening weekend than afterward.”*

*With Apple’s previous devices such as the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone and even the Watch, shoppers didn’t require a lot of ”coaxing and coaching,” the columnist noted.*

*”The Vision Pro will be a different beast. Few consumers are accustomed to wearing a mixed-reality headset, and Apple's model requires particular care,” Gurman said.* *“If the device isn't fitted to someone's head correctly — or is missing the right lenses — the entire experience could be ruined, potentially costing Apple a $3,499 sale forever.”*

*Apple Does Groundwork: ”Apple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes — longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom,” Gurman said. The company has also trained several hundred employees at its offices in Cupertino, he added. “To make sure retail staffers get everything right,” Apple hosted several hundred employees at its offices this month in Cupertino to walk them through the process, the columnist said.*

*Gurman noted that the customer* ***demos will begin at Apple’s U.S. retail stores on the launch date***, *with sign-ups beginning at 8 a.m. local time. More than a dozen demo units will be made available simultaneously at the largest stores, with dedicated sit-down areas where presentations will take place, he said*.

***The Modus Operandi: Gurman outlined the demo process as follows:*** *retail store worker scans user’s face with an app, similar to setting up Face ID. Scan will help decide on the light seal, foam cushion and band size that suits the customer*. *If the user wears glasses, the store worker will use a device to scan lenses for prescription information. All these details gathered by the worker will be handed over to a staffer in the store’s backroom to assemble the demo Vision Pro with correct accessories. The store employee will then hand the demo device to the customer and explain how the interface works, including how to control the pointer using a user's eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. Once the headset is on, the customer will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. As the 20- to 25-minute demo begins, the user will be directed to the photo apps followed by examples of panorama shots. The customer will then see 3D images, following which the user will be shown how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. The customer will then be shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. Demo devices will be preloaded with various third-party apps that are launching with the device next month*.

*”The goal of the demos is giving users an experience that's compelling but not exhausting — ideally leaving them itching for more,” Gurman said. The key issue, the columnist said, is making sure customers stay comfortable while wearing the Vision Pro. This, however, could be challenging, as several retail employees have already said that they felt their heads were tired and sweaty after only using the device for a half hour, he said. Apple also aims to ensure that product reviewers will get the best experience by having them participate in two in-person sessions with the company before being sent a device, Gurman said.*

*Still, none of these measures will ensure success within the next year or two as the product is just too expensive and cumbersome to win over mainstream consumers, he said.*

*“But looking out a few years — once the price and weight go down, and there are more compelling features — Apple may have laid the groundwork for something big,” the Apple specialist said.*

*Apple ended Friday’s session up 0.18% at $185.92, according to Benzinga Pro.*

19855en,stocks,"Ampere vs LightShed: two conflicting outlooks on legacy media streaming services: Disney+, Max, Peacock & Paramount.",".........................................

***\*Ampere:***

*Ampere Analysis predicts direct-to-consumer streaming businesses of all major U.S. media companies – sans any sports streaming operations – will achieve consistent profitability within 18 months.*

*In analysis released Wednesday, the firm pegs* ***Disney*** *as poised to get there first (as early as calendar Q1 2024) but followed in short order by* ***Warner Bros***. *Discovery (predicted profitability by Q3 2024), with* ***Paramount*** *and* ***NBCUniversal*** *close on others’ heels (both projected to reach the goal by Q1 2025). It should be noted analysis of NBCU only takes into account U.S.-based Peacock streaming operations and not Comcast’s traditional pay TV-led services or Sky Showtime. And taking sports out of the equation is another significant caveat.*

*Disney, in its most recent earnings report grew DTC revenue 12% year over year to $5.04 billion, while narrowing DTC operating losses substantially to $420 million (compared to $1.4 billion DTC losses in the same period a year prior.) Disney’s DTC operations include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. The company in 2023 implemented a broader cost-cutting initiative that included cutting 7,000 jobs globally and put it on track to slash costs by roughly $7.5 billion.*

*“Not only have all the major studio streamers now laid the groundwork for profitability…but they all also look likely to turn streaming direct into significant sources of profit,” wrote Ampere in its report. By 2028, Ampere expects studios will generate between $1 billion and $2 billion in annual EBIT from streaming businesses, based on their current market footprint – with further geographic expansion leading to even greater potential upside.*

*Alongside cost-cutting measures and spending pullbacks Ampere pointed to the embrace of ad-supported products as the second key factor in driving a shift toward profitability. It pegged advertising as a “wild card opportunity” that could generate significantly more growth than currently modeled.*

.................................................................................

***\*LightShed:***

*Analysts at LightShed say “we are even more convinced today than 2018 that legacy media companies are making a mistake and all need to radically alter their streaming strategies.”*

*“All four are laser focused on eliminating streaming losses and shoring up balance sheets rather than growing the most robust and profitable long-term streaming business,” wrote analysts led by Richard Greenfield in a December 19 post.*

*LightShed shared prescriptions for streaming businesses of each media company, some of which it thinks should be shut down altogether – including* ***Peacock***. *The firm noted operating losses for Peacock since launch will come in at more than $7.5 billion at the end of 2023, “with NO obvious path to Peacock ever paying back Comcast’s investment.” LightShed suggested Comcast could shift away from a focus on sports to make Peacock look more like Starz – or possibly merge it with both Starz and Showtime. They also advised the ad-supported version of Peacock could be revamped as a FAST service leaning on NBCU’s TV and film catalog.\**

*For* ***Disney***, *one piece of advice from the firm is to abandon plans for a flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product and move prime ESPN+* *content to a combined Hulu-Disney+ app; “We believe Disney has to pick one streaming business to focus* *ALL of the company’s energy and resources; in turn, Disney should focus their efforts on the streaming platform where they have full control of the IP/content versus licensing sports rights from third-parties,” wrote the analysts*.

*As for* ***Paramount***, *LightShed doesn’t see “how Paramount+ can earn a compelling payback on the billions of dollars that have already been invested” and would scale back the SVOD right away and reverse course on the integration of Showtime, among other steps. Ultimately the firm expects Paramount will be sold.*

*LightShed also doesn’t have a rosy view of* ***Warner Bros***; *“With the accelerating collapse of linear TV, we simply do not believe Warner Bros. Discovery has the ability to become a leading global streaming competitor with enough scale to drive profitable growth,” the firm stated*.

*The analysts said WBD should rebrand the Max SVOD service as HBO and get rid of content that doesn’t fit the brand (meaning newly integrated assets such as Discovery content and CNN), while keeping Discovery+ as a standalone niche streaming service.*

*Finally, the firm doesn’t see M&A as the answer to media companies’ streaming struggles, as LightShed said it’s too late and companies are “not equipped talent-wise or strategy-wise” to build global streaming services on top of linear TV businesses facing growing headwinds. It also sees regulatory approval as a challenge:*

“*Legacy media companies simply do not have time to wait and hope for M&A as a strategy,” wrote Greenfield. “They must take action to alter their streaming strategies immediately or their stocks will continue to suffer*.”

1982rn5,stocks,"Everything I'm watching and Analysing in premarket 16/01. Includes analysis of Tesla, Forex and Levels to Watch for the day","**ANALYSIS:**

* We are seeing a slight decline in premarket. That’s in part due to the sell off in AAPL and TSLA, which are big components of the indices. 
* But we can look more into it and see that there have been a rebalancing of rate cut bets for March this morning, following UK employment data. The chance of rate cut in march is now showing at 66% vs 77% on Friday on CME Fedwatch tool, with chance of no cut rising to 30%.   

* This is the result of the move higher in USD in premarket, reaching 1 month highs at the key level of 103.3 on DXY.   

* This is in part due to UK employment data which came strong, even though the wage growth came in lower, which led GBP lower.   

* We cans ee that because of this volatility in the dollar in premarket, traders are hedging with OTM put options, which has brought skew down slightly. But money flow block traders remain v high.   

* Vix has jumped, will likely come down and can fuel buy the dip later in session.   
This is confirmed by selling of puts on nasdaq.   

* Key levels to watch on TESLA are at 200, a smaller level at 210.
* Key level on AAPL is 180.
* NVDA and MSFt, both of which have more bullish positioning than other Mag 7 firms, are both green in premarket, but barely.   


**Let’s look at positioning on IWM, since I have been requested this a few times.**   


* Spot price is below the key gamma level of 195, and block trade flows are showing increased short selling from hedge funds. Skew is lwoer too. 
* All in all, it looks like IWM is positioned to move lower in short term.
* We can see from the blue line below that hedge funds have been taking profit since the start of the year. 
* Main options are selling fo call options which is bearish.   

* [https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0](https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0)    

* Theres a gamma level at 190, which is likely to be the low of the day.   
Below that, Put support is at 185.    


**Now a bit on FX:**

* Skew is pulling back a bit on EURUSD after data this morning. We are seeing traders hedge their long with OTM put with strike 1.08.
* Still, open interest on 1.10 is v high, we can expect a reversal tot here hopefully soon, depending on data.   


**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Goldman Sachs released a report that earnings momentum has trended down since the start of Q4 2023, following weakness in Euro area PMIs. They highlighted the chart below to show how profit downgrades have outpaced profit upgrades over the past few months, despite equity prices moving higher. They used this as evidence to suggest equity prices can do some correction this earnings season. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV](https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV)    

* Deutsche Bank put out a piece where they were clear outliers against the consensus expectation for Q4 2023 earnings to tick lower. Dutch bank. Expects them to come out at record highs. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9](https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9)    

* Blackrock put out a piece where they argued that the optimism on rate cuts in the US is currently overdone. In a similar piece, Barclays moved back their expectation of first rate cuts in March, now expecting the first rate cut to be in June. Goldman is currently an outlier, as they still anticipate first rate cut for Fed in March, with ECB and BOE tor ollow later.    

* Bank of America said in their EPFR report that flows into equity funds went negative this past week to -9.5b from +4.4b the week before.   


**DATA LEDE:**

* Australia WESTPAC consumer confidence index decline slightly from 82.1 to 81. It has remained in this range of 79 to 82 for much of the year so this is no major concern.   

* Japan PPI comes in hotter than expected, at 0.3% MOM vs 0% forecast. YOY at 0% vs -0.3% forecast.  
PPI is a leading indicator of CPI. YOY flat for first time since feb 2021, no increase. That’s probably not great for BOJ who want to see persistently higher inflation.  

* **UK EMPLOYMENt NUMBERS:**  
Employment change came stronger than expected at 73k vs 50k forecast. This is the highest read since April last year. Points to a stronger than expected jobs market.   
Unemployment rate came in line with expectations at 4.2%  
Average earnigns incl bonus came less than expected, at 6.5% vs 6.8% forecast.   

* We can see it was a mixed bag. Jobs report mostly came stronger than expected, in the headline employment change number, but the wage inflation aspect came less than expected, and that’s indicative of future services inflation.   
GBP mostly flat on this, although USD is higher, which is hurting the GBPUSD pair.   
Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.   

* **ZEW economic index for Euro and Germany both came stronger than expected, Germany’s came as highest since February last year.**   
Survey showed that more than 2/3 of respondents expect rate cuts by Fed in next 6 months.   


**FOREX:**

* AUD is following Chinese markets lower, compounded by the weaker confidence number.   

* GBP itself is relatively flat, slightly lower following employment change, but USD is rallying which is hurting the GBPUSD pair. Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.   

* Euro partly lower as 1 year inflation expectations drop to 1.5 year low.   

* Yen slightly higher after PPI numbers, but USDJPY higher on rising dollar.   

* DXY up 0.6% to a key level of 103.3  

* AUDUSD sitting at 0.66 key level. 
* EURUSD broke below 1.09 level
* GBP 1.26 as support.   


**MARKETS:**

* European markets lower as they follow EURUSD lower this morning. Yesterday was at resistance of 16800, but fell yesterday back to 16.6k. Continued lower during Asian session, then during Europe open.   

* HKG50 - broke 16k, now trading at 15.87k. Moving lower as Taiwan election and lack of rate cuts yesterday hurt sentiment slightly.   

* SPX: Rejected at 4800 on Friday. Yesterday was flat due to public holiday, around 4780. Moved slightly lwoer during European session.   
AAPL weighing on index, down 1.8% in premarket. TSLA down 1.7%  

* NASDAQ: down 0.5% in premarket, trading at 16,750. Its below the 2021 high, will be trying to recover this level. Can get rejected there.   

* Oil - North Dakota oil production is down 400k barrels per day due to freezing weather, which as a supply restriction, should support price. The fundamentals of the oil market with the Rede Sea tensions is supporting oil, as it maintains the green despite rising dollar which would normally Drag oil into the red.   

* US Bond yields moving slightly higher today.   


**KEY LEVELS TO WATCH BASED ON THE OPTIONS MARKET:**  


* **SPX**:
* Call resistance remains at 4800. This will be a big barrier to break and will be a big resistance.   
We are seeing some gamma building on 4825, but is small. But some traders are looking higher now. 
* HVL is 4745, there’s a big gamma level around 4750-4745. We can expect this to act as some support.   

* Low of the day if we get there is likely to be 4740, says my quant.   
4750/4745 to offer some support before then probably. 
* High of the day likely to be 4800.  

* These levels were drawn without the TESLA, AAPL news included. A big move in AAPL and TESLA and these levels can break.   

* **QQQ**:
* Call resistance at 410 which will be hard to break. 
* If we do break that then next gamma level up is at 412.   

* Key areas of support are at 406 which is the HVL  
Then below that, the min of the day that my quant is telling me is 404. Expect a bounce from there.   

* That’s around the low of the day from Thursday for those wondering.   


**MAG 7 NEWS:**  


* AAPL - has offered Chinese customers a 5% discount on iPhone 15s, in a bid to try to drum up demand, in what is currently a flagging market for them.   

* AAPL has also decided to remove their blood oxygen sensor from their watch, in order to avoid the US ban. US customs has said that with this change, they won’t be subject to the ban. AAPL working to roll out the adjusted watch. The ruling for the ban has been taken to an appeals court and expected verdict is today.   

* TSLA - Musk has expressed a need to maintain at least 25% stake in Tesla, stating that if such control is not retained, he would prefer to develop AI products outside of the company.   

* MSFT - opening up its Ai copilot to consumers and making corporate version available to smaller companies,. The consumer version will be 20 a month.   

* NVDA - maintained at overweight by Keybanc.   


**COMPANY SPECIFIC NEWS:**

* GOLDMAN AND MORGAN STNALEY EARNINGS. - I don’t trade banking stocks so not reading them too in depth in premarket. Will give them proper look later. 
* Here’s the headline from GS:  
Revenue of 11.32B beat by 4.5%  
EPS came 5.48 which was a big beat by 65% vs expectation  
Assets under management beat expectations by 1.5%  
Trading revenue fell short at 2.03B, missing by 22%  
Global Banking revenue was amiss by 1.4%  

* FDX - is launching its own commerce platform for merchants, called FDX Today. This will offer merchants services such as demand generation, fulfilment etc, in what is essentially a competition to Amazon.   

* SNPS finalises $35b deal to buy ANSS.  

* BA - Wells Fargo downgrades to equal weight rom overweight, with price target of 225 from 280.   

* DE - partnership with SpaceX to link their equipment.   

* UBER - shuttering alcohol delivery service Drizly, which they bought for 1.1b 3 years ago.   

* Chinese stocks will be lower following Hong Kong market lwoer, particularly XPENG despite it beginning X9 deliveries in China. This is because they are facing CHina related pressure and Tesla related pressure as TESLa will drag the Ev sector down.  

* BIDU down on report that links Ernie Bot to PLA AI, and military using AI.   

* CPNG lwoer dragged with Asian stocks.   

* LEVI cut to equal by Wells Fargo, price target still 13% above spot.

1981nrz,stocks,2024 will suffer further decline in broadband; early signals point to a return to growth in 2025 & current pockets of growth will mitigate,"***DELL'ORO GROUP*** *January 11th 2024.* ***2024 Outlook: Broadband Market Faces Challenge Amidst Lower Spending from 2023:***

**“*****Inventory Correction is the root cause of 2023’s broadband spending slowdown*** *which will likely persist well into 2024. Without the benefit of fourth quarter numbers, total spending on broadband equipment in 2023 is expected to show a decline of around 10%. Early projections for 2024 indicate an additional 5% year-over-year decrease, as the lagging impact of interest rate increases to curb inflation will be felt more acutely. This additional 5% decrease would put total spending to around $16.5 B—roughly equal to 2021 spending levels*.  
  
***The expected declines in 2023 and 2024*** *follow three straight years of white-hot growth in broadband network and service investments from 2020 to 2022. During this period,  year-over-year growth rates reached 9%, 15%, and 17%, respectively. Similar periods of growth from 2003-2006 and 2010-2014 were both followed by two subsequent years of reduced spending, as operators—particularly in China—shifted their capital expenditure focus from broadband to mobile RAN.*  
  
***The silver lining here is that very early signals regarding 2025 show a return to growth****, as BEAD and other subsidization efforts begin to trickle down to broadband equipment suppliers. Well before that, pockets of growth in fixed wireless CPE, cable DAA equipment and CPE, and continued spending on PON equipment by tier 2 and tier 3 operators should make the broadband market one in which the headlines might communicate malaise, but a peek under the hood shows clear signs of resilience powering an inevitable return to growth*.  


*Cable Operators Travel Different Paths to Fend off Fixed Wireless and Fiber Just like last year, in the minds of cable consumers,* ***cable operators find themselves stuck battling against the perception*** *that they are the provider with inferior copper technology that can’t be flexible when it comes to offering plans that meet a consumer’s budget, like fixed wireless currently can. As a result of this situation, larger cable operators are seeing increased broadband subscriber churn and quarters of net subscriber losses.*

1981mys,stocks,American Companies Plan on Becoming Employers’ Landlords by Building Company Towns,"https://decodetoday.com/american-companies-building-company-towns/

Article body:

The housing crisis in the United States has prompted some major companies to consider building company towns. Instead of relying on traditional rental properties, companies such as Google, Tesla, and Meta are exploring the idea of becoming landlords themselves, building company towns, and purchasing large pieces of land to provide housing for their workers.

In the early 20th century, company towns were a common sight, designed to provide housing, schools, stores, and a sense of community for workers. Fast forward to the present day, and Silicon Valley giants are revisiting this concept, exploring the creation of self-contained communities for their workforce. While the concept of company towns is not new, this modern approach involves providing a range of amenities and services within the community, such as parks, restaurants, and shops, to create a sense of community and improve the work-life balance of employees.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is planning to build an entire town near Austin, Texas, where three of his companies, Boring, Tesla, and SpaceX, have operations. The new company town is intended to offer below-market rents to his employees, providing an attractive solution to the housing challenges faced by many workers. Similarly, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is also considering the construction of a company town to provide housing for its employees. Google is already in the process of building a 153-acre neighborhood near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, which will include over 7,000 residential units and 26 acres of public parks and open space.

While the idea of corporate-built company towns addresses the pressing issue of housing shortages, it has also sparked concerns about employee flexibility. With health insurance already tied to employment, intertwining housing with work could further limit an individual’s freedom to change jobs or locations. Critics argue that this deliberate entanglement is an attempt by companies to exert greater control over their workforce.

In response to these developments, legislation has been introduced to address the growing need for affordable housing. The proposed Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act seeks to provide states and developers with a new source of funding for the production of affordable rental housing. The Workforce Housing Tax Credit (WHTC) Act aims to incentivize the creation of housing for middle-income families. However, skeptics question the true intentions behind the legislation, speculating that it may serve as a tool for companies to claim tax credits while gaining additional influence over their employees.

The trend of companies building towns for their employees is not confined to the United States. Globally, mega-projects like NEOM are emerging as examples where entire towns are being constructed to accommodate workers. This global phenomenon highlights the evolving nature of the employer-employee relationship and the growing influence of corporations in shaping the living environments of their workforce.",2024-01-16 12:19:54,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212346,44 days 03:09:56.212346,478,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1981mys/american_companies_plan_on_becoming_employers/
198186g,stocks,"Red Sea disruption prolonged may curb effort in fighting inflation and delay interest rate cuts, pressure on stock markets","Recall that the long expected interest rate cuts forecast had been boosting the stock markets in the second half of December 2023, however the prolonged Red Sea disruption may curb effort in fighting inflation and delay interest rate cuts, which in turns add pressure on stock markets.

Whilst a few companies have already indicated that the Red Sea disruption will affect their supply chain, it will be worthwhile to rethink (1) what will be the additional cost involved in the transition period and (2) is it only last for two to four weeks only?

In fact, the recent action taken by the US and the UK, as well as the disclosures made by different companies, have implicitly shown that both North America and Europe are still relying heavily on Asia to supply raw materials and finished / consumer goods.

Based on the ongoing news, we may simply focus on the soaring logistics / insurance costs. Yet, let's consider the idle costs as well (e.g. factories need to temporary shut down, not enough goods to be sold in the stores, etc), which will cause top line and bottom line tumble at the same time - **especially for those relying on business across Europe and Asia**.

At the same time, some companies were saying that the impact would be two to four weeks only (given the voyage via Cape of Good Hope is 10 days longer). However, it will not be the case since shipping companies tend to combine / consolidate shipments, in order to maintain their profit level. That said, the waiting time at each stopping point will be longer unless it is a chartered vessel and **the potential impact will be far from two to four weeks**.

**More oil tankers shun southern Red Sea after US-led strikes in Yemen (15 January 2024)**

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/more-oil-tankers-shun-southern-red-sea-after-us-led-strikes-yemen-2024-01-15](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/more-oil-tankers-shun-southern-red-sea-after-us-led-strikes-yemen-2024-01-15)

*At least six more oil tankers were steering clear of the southern Red Sea on Monday, as disruptions increase on the vital route for energy shipping in the wake of U.S.-led strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.*

*Prior to the strikes it had been mostly container ships which were avoiding the Red Sea, with oil tanker traffic largely unchanged in December.*

*But since the CMF (Combined Maritime Forces)'s warning, a growing number of oil tankers are avoiding the region, increasing the potential for disruptions to oil supply via the Suez Canal in both directions.*

*Reuters on Monday counted six tankers that had altered their course, making a total of at least fifteen vessels to do so since the start of the strikes, ship tracking data from LSEG and Kpler showed.*

*Vessels transiting the Red Sea have faced attacks over the past several weeks from Yemen-based Houthis, prompting shipping companies to change routes, leading to a spike in freight rates.Longer detours around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa have pushed ocean freight rates up to $10,000 per 40-foot container.If this goes on for three to six months the profits will again slowly approach 2022 levels, said an NVOCC.*

*The re-routing of a growing number of ships around Africa to avoid potential attacks in the Red Sea is altering refueling patterns and boosting demand for bunker fuel at far-flung ports, from the Mauritius to South Africa to the Canary Islands.*

*Ships are also expected to top up more at Singapore and Rotterdam, the two busiest bunkering ports and where fuel is competitively priced, as they try to hedge against uncertainty over route changes, traders and analysts said.*

*Bunker fuel demand has risen at ports including Mauritius' Port Louis, Gibraltar and ports in the Canary Islands and South Africa, said traders and industry sources, with sales jumping in Cape Town and Durban.*

*Prices of low-sulphur bunker fuel delivered at Cape Town have jumped 15% to almost $800 per metric ton since mid-November when the attacks started, data from bunker supplier Integr8 Fuels showed.*

*Spot premiums for prompt low-sulphur bunker fuel delivered at Singapore rose to $25 to $30 a metric ton above cargo quotes in mid-January, climbing from about $20 in early January, said industry sources.*

*The lengthy diversions for ocean cargo vessels as a result of the Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea have caused air freight volumes to soar, and the cost of shipping cargo by plane will see a significant increase if the crisis does not abate, with anxiety rising among companies.*

*The current spike in use of air freight is primarily in cargo volumes bound for Europe, as more companies avoid the longer Red Sea diversions around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, according to Xeneta, a leading ocean and air freight rate benchmarking platforms.*

*Flights are already on average 93% full from a cargo perspective, and it is likely air freight rates will increase much more than 10% if the current increase in demand continues.*

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

197qbfb,stocks,Kelly Criterion for Corporate Bonds,"Here's a formula that will give you the Kelly Criterion (% Allocation of principal already committed to being invested in corporate bonds). It's basically how much of your capital you should risk given probabilities of success & win/loss ratios;

# K = d - ((1 - d) / (y / (1 - y/2)))

Where

d = default rate of corporate bond(s)

y = yield of corporate bond(s)

K = Kelly Criterion, % allocation of committed contributions to go towards the bond(s)

I believe this will work the best with bonds since win/loss and \[credit\] risks of default are for the most part defined & outlined. Your win value is absolute, your loss value is absolute, your win % is kind of absolute as it uses current default rates. This could work on any bond fund or well diversified bond holdings.

# Backtest:

The backtest was composed of simulating contributing $100 every month to a brokerage account, using the Kelly % to see how much of it gets invested and how much stays as cash, however the leftover cash is added to the cash balance which will always be higher than using the entire contribution to invest every time, and the Kelly % is based on TOTAL cash including $100 contribution to account, so the ""lack"" of contributions from using the Kelly % is just added onto the pool of free cash to use to invest for the next period. We're also assuming that cash to be held in a settlement fund yielding the risk-free rate. The other portfolio is 100% investment of the $100 contributions every time.

The fund simulated to invest in is LQD (US Corporate Bonds).

The backtest starts Q3 2003 up to Q3 2023, 20 years flat. There were 8 definable ""credit/rate/debt cycles"" so the sample size is acceptable enough. The total contributions were $8,000 ($100 \* 4Q \* 20Y)

Results:

Kelly Portfolio: **$13,239 (+65.5%, +$5,239)**

Full Contribution: $9,997 (+25%, +$1,997)

This is a +32.4% difference in the ending portfolio balance, 2.62x the 20 year gains, in favor of the Kelly portfolio.

197l7tg,stocks,IBKR- Interactive Brokers: overview and valuation,"Business overview  
  
Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is an electronic broker that has clients in over 200 countries worldwide. It makes money primarily through transaction fees and margin lending. 68% of its accounts are individuals and 22% through its introducing brokerage services.  
  
Ownership and management  
  
The company was founded by Thomas Peterffy in 1977. He is still chairman of the board and plays an active role in the company. The CEO is Milan Galik, the handpicked successor to Mr. Peterffy.   
  
The management/board still owns 75% of the company, while 25% is publicly held. The publicly held portion of the company functions as a holding company. The amount of insider selling gets mentioned frequently. The insiders all sell frequently and have for years. While the public float increases each year due to this selling, there are no new shares of the company being issued. The shares are just transitioning from private to public as insiders slowly sell their stake into the public market. This is an odd arrangement, while there is a large amount of stock that could be dumped on public markets it does not benefit the holders of that stock to do so in a way that tanks the stock price.  
  
This ownership team clearly has skin in the game, as a large portion of their personal wealth is tied to the company. Peterffy, who is almost 80 years old, has resolved his succession questions by establishing a handpicked CEO who is a long time company veteran.   
  
Growth drivers  
  
IBKR has two main growth drivers. First, they are signing up new clients. As of December 2023 they had a 20% y/y increase in accounts. Their customers are relatively evenly divided between North America, Europe, and Asia. While they are a small player in the US market, They are growing rapidly in developing markets, many of which do not have many options for individuals to invest.   
  
Second, higher interest rates have increased the net interest margins on their margin loans. They advertise significantly lower rates than other large brokerages. They are able to do this through superior risk management and increased automation. This automation gives IBKR an advantage over brokerages such as Schwab. IBKR produces $1.48 million of revenue per employee, while Schwab generates $563,000.   
  
IBKR also has excellent risk management. They have no long term corporate debt (they have short term, client related debt which shows up on some screeners) and they invest their float only in short duration assets. As a result, during the SVB crisis, Schwab had serious issues with duration risk, while IBKR did not. This has also enabled IBKR to offer much higher interest rates on cash held in investment accounts. IBKR pays 4.8% while Schwab pays 0.45%. This makes IBKR more attractive to investors. As people come to expect higher returns on their money, IBKR is set up to take customers. Schwab (and other brokers) will have a hard time matching this as they invested in longer duration assets in search of yield.  
  
  
Risks  
  
A return to 0% interest rates would hurt the earnings of the company. Higher rates lead to higher margin loan rates, and more profitability. IBKR has proven to be profitable in a 0% rate environment, but (like many financial institutions) they are more so as rates rise. Central to my thesis is that rates will not go back to the levels of the last decade.   
  
There is regulatory risk for the company as they operate in 200+ markets. Thus far the company has proven adept at meeting these regulations. There is also the risk of a credit event causing loan losses. IBKR has successfully navigated numerous credit events in its history including: the GReat financial crisis, Savings and loan scandal, and the Asian Financial crisis. In its history none of these events caused large write downs, attesting to the quality risk management of the company. The largest write off they have had was when oil prices went negative during covid and they were unable to close out customer orders due to their software not being able to process negative commodity prices. This resulted in a $100 million writedown.  
  
The company currently pays a small dividend, but does not buyback stock. There are also significant currency risks as the company operates in so many markets.  
  
  
Valuation  
  
IBKR is tough to value because of its large private ownership. The enterprise value is around $43 billion while its market cap is around $9.5 billion. As you can get very different values depending on how you figure the size of the company. I’ll generally be looking at the market cap, since that seems to be a popular way of valuing the company. It’s also how the company reports their earnings.  
  
The 5 year average P/E for the company is 22, and it is currently trading around 15x. This indicates its potentially undervalued, if there will be no changes to the business.  
  
There are two publicly traded comps for IBKR, those being Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Robin Hood (HOOD).   
  
Hood is similar in size to IBKR, both having around a $9 billion market cap. HOOD is trading around 5x sales and is not GAAP profitable. IBKR is trading at 1.3x sales and is profitable. IBKR has a much longer history and has regularly grown revenue in the mid teens.   
  
SCHW trades at 21x earnings and 5x sales, so it is trading at a premium to IBKR right now. Schwab has gross margins of 78% versus 93% for IBKR. However, Schwab puts up profit margins of 21% versus 8% for IBKR. Part of the reason for the discount might be the lower profit margins.   
  
If IBKR re-rates to a comparable multiple to its peers, there is about a 25% upside. The trailing 12 month EPS is $5.50, which at a 20x multiple would result in a stock price of $110. This would be in addition to the growth of the business, which has historically compounded at a mid-teens rate.. Morningstar has their fair value at $112, which supports this analysis.  
  
Closing thoughts  
  
While I think the company is trading at an attractive valuation, the ownership structure is concerning. I think this company will benefit greatly if rates stay higher. They also have a long growth runway. The public share dilution also would concern me as an owner, even though it's not technically dilution, I feel like my shares would become less valuable each year. The company is due to report earnings on January 16th, so there might be changes reported by the time anyone reads this. Currently, I have no position in this name.",2024-01-15 21:55:51,2024-02-29 15:29:50.212354,44 days 17:33:59.212354,25,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/197l7tg/ibkr_interactive_brokers_overview_and_valuation/

*As part of a potential agreement, Disney-owned ESPN would take control of NFL Media, which includes NFL Network, and the league would receive equity in ESPN.*  
  
*For the long-term viability of ESPN aligning with the most powerful sports league would enhance its position as the network plans to move to direct to consumer by 2025.*

*The owners and players need to be involved in the equity agreement because of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the two sides that calls for them to share revenues. It is unclear of how an equity stake in ESPN would be accounted for in the CBA.*  
  
*It still could take months for a deal to be finalized. Both ESPN and the NFL declined comment.*

""*As cord cutting has matured and helped millions save money on TV, cord cutters now have new ways to save money. The Internet. Cord cutting has come for Internet services, which will make it easy to save money with cord cutting 2.0.*  
  
*What is cord cutting 2.0? Cord cutting 1.0 was cutting the cord on cable TV. In 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is about cutting the cord on expensive home Internet and getting new, less expensive options.*  
  
*Cord cutting 2.0 took off in 2023 as we saw Verizon and T-Mobile add 941,000 5G home Internet customers in the third quarter. That was up from the 890,000 they added in the second quarter. This news comes as most cable TV companies lost Internet subscribers in the third quarter of 2023.*  
  
*Cable broadband providers like Comcast and Spectrum are facing new competition not only from 5G home Internet services but also from fiber, fixed wireless access service providers, satellite services, and more. For the first time ever, Americans finally have options for home Internet, and they are starting to cut the Internet cord.*  
  
*This new access to more Internet service options has—for the first time—made it possible to completely break free from cable TV companies: Not only from the TV service but also from the Internet service.*

*New providers are not the only factor contributing to subscriber losses. Pricing is heavily factored into peoples’ decisions on whether to switch providers.*  
  
*AT&T has also launched 5G home Internet services in 2023 to bring home Internet options to Americans who have not had options in the past.*  
  
*Much like in the early days of cord cutting 1.0, the growth of 2.0 is slow right now. We are waiting for more providers to join the market. Amazon announced plans to start offering home Internet next year. Other providers are quickly building out new kinds of Internet to give Americans options.*  
  
*Now as we move farther into 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is poised for rapid growth as Spectrum—one of the few cable TV companies to still be adding new Internet customers—says it expects to lose customers in the fourth quarter of 2023.*

*Over the next five years, cable providers will have to deal with a growing number of competitors in a business that was once seen as their safe bet to fight cord cutting. Internet is the front line of the next generation of cord cutting.*""",2024-01-15 15:14:17,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641181,45 days 00:15:34.641181,47,0.37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/197b17c/cordcutting_20_cutting_home_internet_is_ramping/

196rajd,stocks,An Exploration of Analyst Ratings and Stock Market Bias,"TLDR - Potential heavy bias on aggregated ratings towards buy/outperform ratings with virtually no sell/underperform ratings on aggregate. Is this justified in your opinion?  
Hello everyone,  
I’ve embarked on an interesting project recently. I wanted to build a neural network model. The goal? To analyze stock data (fundamentals and price data) from Thompson Reuters and respective analyst ratings.  
The idea was to identify companies that are either unrated or not followed by analysts, and use the model to assign them theoretical ratings. Additionally, I wanted to spot companies with changing fundamentals that are likely to be re-rated soon, potentially leading to significant price movements.  
My dataset primarily consists of US-listed stocks across major exchanges and pink slips. However, it also includes stocks listed on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges, as these are the three regions where I trade/invest. For more international exposure, I use ETFs.  
In total, my investable universe comprises around 17-18K stocks, with 7624 of them having an analyst following. Thompson Reuters provides a “score” from 1-5 for each stock, where 1 is a strong buy/overperform and 5 is a sell.  
To quickly clarify and avoid any confusion this initial test is only for aggregated ratings for stocks for example AAPL was recently given a downgrade by Barclays which led to it losing a considerable amount of market cap. However, the aggregate rating given for AAPL is still a ""Buy"".  
On aggregate, there’s a heavy skew to the upside, as seen below:  
Rating Number Percentage  
Hold 1488 19.5%  
Buy 3882 50.9%  
Overperform 2120 27.8%  
Underperform 117 1.5%  
Sell 17 0.2%  
This leads me to question the validity of these results. Should nearly 80% of stocks have a buy or outperform rating? Especially in a market that is relatively/historically quite expensive, this seems incredibly high.  
While I wouldn’t trade/buy based on any given analyst ratings, this project was more of a fun side venture. However, I’m somewhat disappointed with the results of this data-gathering stage, as any model trained in this way will be heavily biased and statistically insignificant unless you believe that the analysts on aggregate are correct.  
I plan to start gathering this data over time, but unless something significant happens to the economy, I’m not sure if the aggregate data will be that interesting, other than indicating a potential heavy bias.  
My next step is to examine the individual numbers for each stock in terms of the number of buys/holds/sells, etc., and see if I can derive something more meaningful to model as well as maybe try and explore the validity of the aggregated ratings. I enjoy creating models, even if they’re not always for practical purposes.  
This exploration has shown why downgrades seem to hit a company a lot harder than upgrades.  
I’d love to hear your thoughts on analyst ratings/reports in general as well as if you think that analyst ratings are justified or not.",2024-01-14 21:49:52,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641199,45 days 17:39:59.641199,11,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196rajd/an_exploration_of_analyst_ratings_and_stock/
196p9ve,stocks,Random basket vs S&P 500,"Hey y'all! Purely academic question here. Would 500 randomly selected stocks have the same expected rate of return as the S&P 500? If no, why not? Based on some light internet research, there doesn't seem to be a clear answer, but wondering if there are any finance experts here who can provide more insight.

Edit: To further clarify my question, I understand how the S&P 500 works, and I know that it's composed of more competent companies than a random basket would be. However, my theory is that that increased competency is already baked into the prices of the stocks composing the S&P 500, meaning they're year on year growth is limited. I'm guessing a random basket will have much more volatile results on the high and low end, but at the end of the day, will have approximately the same returns.",2024-01-14 20:26:32,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641203,45 days 19:03:19.641204,79,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196p9ve/random_basket_vs_sp_500/
196mc18,stocks,"Housing: Bidding wars erupt as 2024 kicks off, with some listings seeing over 30 offers","Relevance to homebuilder stocks such as $PHM, $LEN, $TOL, $MDC, $BLDR, etc.  Also mortgage stocks and credit reporting agencies.

* Improved mortgage rates means buyers are coming back — and that means competition.

* Would-be homebuyers are once again coming out of hibernation, this time prepared to strike a deal before competition heats up.

* The volume of applications for a mortgage increased 9.9% from one week earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending Jan. 10, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Some of that activity was driven by purchase applications, which increased 6% from the previous week, as buyers capitalized on the year-end decline in rates and a small boost in inventory levels.

For rate-sensitive buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines, these first few weeks of the year could offer a window to purchase, experts said. Still, any relief in affordability could be short-lived.

Bidding wars are already erupting in some areas of the US, which could drive up home prices among the few attractive listings. Additionally, new economic data this week could sway the Federal Reserve to postpone its planned rate cuts — keeping rates higher for longer.

""Prices here are all over the board. If your house is updated with the most recent home trends, you’re going to get offers,"" St. Louis-based Stayce Mayfield, a Redfin premier agent, told Yahoo Finance. ""We’re still getting bidding wars with anywhere from 20-30 offers — though it still depends on the location and condition.""

Mayfield added, ""Some of our buyers agents are still experiencing multiple offers and struggling to get their clients in a home.""

**Where bidding wars are erupting**

As the new year kicked off, more buyers trickled into the housing market.

According to Redfin, mortgage-purchase applications were up 3% compared to a month ago during the first week of January. Redfin agents also reported requests for tours were up 5% from this time in December, and there were 9% more new listings on the market in the four weeks ending Jan. 7 compared to a year ago.

""Right now, I think the majority of our agents all over the country expected to have a busy first few weeks in January given consults,"" Redfin spokesperson Allison Braun told Yahoo Finance. ""However, given the storms that are pushing through the country [that’s] really leaving potential homebuyers at home and on the sidelines.""

By contrast, areas with good weather saw an uptick in activity. One Redfin agent in Phoenix noted an unusual uptick in activity this week.

""Telling my buyers to get in the market now, interest rates are lower and competition is low,"" said Phoenix premier agent Heather Mahmood-Corley. ""I imagine competition will really pick up in March and prices will start to soar. March really is a hot month here, the weather starts to get better.""

The uptick in competition, though, could erode that newfound affordability. According to Redfin, at least 24% of homes sold in the four weeks leading up to Jan. 7, sold above list price. On average, the median price of homes sold was $363,125, up 4.1% year over year.

Meanwhile, South Carolina-based president of Home Loans Inc. Jason Sharon, also noted a pickup in bidding wars in Charleston, S.C. — as well as in Atlanta and Huntsville, Ala. Some of those buyers may also have been lured into the market by the influx of new listings.

""I am already seeing bidding wars in cities with good job markets,"" Sharon told Yahoo Finance. ""Generally, they are houses in good condition, at or below the median price point. If mortgage rates continue their slow decline, I believe we will see more buyers enter the market, causing even more bidding wars.""

Buyers were also picky about where they put their money.

""No one wants to do a fixer upper right now, unless it’s in a really desirable neighborhood and the price is right,"" Mayfield said. ""I was working with a first-time homebuyer recently. We put in six offers (in the 200 range) and all the houses we put offers on kept losing. One of the houses we put an offer on had 33 other offers.""

**'Demand will depend on mortgage rates'**

Though competition has seemingly begun to pick up in some segments of the US, mortgage rates could destabilize that momentum.

""Demand in the market, especially from first-time buyers, will likely depend a good deal on what happens with mortgage rates,"" Nicole Bachaud, Zillow senior economist, told Yahoo Finance. ""As it looks now, rates are likely to stay down from the 8% peak.""

Within the last three months, mortgage rates have plunged more than a full point to a low of 6.62% the week ending Jan. 4.

The dip in rates saved potential buyers an average of $325 on their monthly mortgage payment from the all-time high set in the four weeks ending Oct. 22, Redfin found. Still, at a rate of 6.62%, buyers would have an average payment of $2,399 — up 7.4% year-over-year.

""While lower rates might sound like a saving grace to affordability, rates are still fairly high, keeping the cost of a mortgage out of reach for many,"" Bachaud said.

Those hesitant to re-enter the market may face slightly higher mortgage rates in the near term.

Both inflation and unemployment readings came in higher than expected in December — indicating that the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting interest rates. According to Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale, that could keep mortgage rates ""higher for longer,"" potentially causing rates to increase over the next few weeks.

The annual inflation rate increased to 3.4%, its highest reading since the 3.7% observed in September. According to the government report, shelter inflation including housing and rent costs continued to be a large influence.

While shelter costs fell from a high of 8.2% in March of last year, they were still up 6.2% year over year in December. According to Realtor.com, shelter costs need to fall to 3.5% in order for inflation to come on target.

“[Elevated rates] will curb total demand, as otherwise would-be buyers look for housing opportunities elsewhere, like single-family rentals,” Bachaud said.


**'Buyers aren’t likely to see price cuts'**

As competition picks up, those waiting around on the sidelines may miss out on opportunities to negotiate a price reduction.

According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in December was just under 16% — the lowest since April 2022.

""Sellers are holding firm on prices, likely thanks to the slower pace of price growth helping sellers (and buyers) know what to expect when it comes to setting a price,"" Bachaud said. ""Price cuts are never popular in the winter.""

Despite an influx of new listings this past month, the overall shortage of inventory was once again to blame for waning price cuts.

Newly listed homes in December were 9% above 2022 levels as sellers showed up in larger numbers, Realtor.com found, marking a second month of increased listing activity after a 17-month streak of decline.

""Competition is complicated. As rates go down there will be more buyer activity but because there has been such little inventory and since homeowners have been waiting, how much will this motivate sellers to go to market?"" Scott Driscoll, Boston-based Redfin premier agent, told Yahoo Finance. ""I do think there will be a lot more activity from sellers.""

Still, active inventory in December remained 36% below typical 2017 to 2019 levels. That’s kept home prices propped up, Realtor.com noted. While the national median list price declined seasonally to $410,000 last month, prices were growing 1.2% compared to a year earlier.

​​""Competition in the market today is a bit stronger than pre-pandemic norms. Although high costs have pushed a lot of first-time buyers to the sidelines, there are also far fewer choices,"" Bachaud said. ""Buyers aren’t likely to see a lot of price cuts, and should expect some opposing bids for the most attractive listings.""

**‘New homes provide options for hungry buyers’**

Some of the pressure in buyer demand could be soothed by new construction.

Single-family home construction surged in November after declining mortgage rates helped relieve some affordability concerns. Overall, housing starts increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Census Bureau.

Should that rate continue to trend lower, that could provide a boost to new construction, noted the National Association of Home Builders.

""Unless we see new homes starts rise to 2 million homes per year, the seller's market will remain strong,"" Sharon said.

Homebuilders reported more confidence, as lower rates have also attracted more buyers back to the market. With the share of previously owned homes on the market still low — builders can still get away with offering incentives for prospective buyers.

In December, 36% of builders said they offered a price cut averaging 6%. Meanwhile, 60% of builders offered sales incentives of all types, the same as November, but slightly down from 62% in October.

""New construction will continue to play an important role in bringing more options to the market,"" Bachaud said. ""As rates cool off from their peak, homebuilders are more optimistic about the future, increasing the number of projects they are starting this winter. Hopefully those starts translate into more new homes hitting the market to cool competition and provide more options for hungry buyers.""",2024-01-14 18:21:20,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641208,45 days 21:08:31.641208,107,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196mc18/housing_bidding_wars_erupt_as_2024_kicks_off_with/

196a603,stocks,Fed's Logan: Pump the brakes on quantitative tightening,"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/feds-logan-pump-the-brakes-on-quantitative-tightening

A top Federal Reserve official wants the Federal Open Market Committee to start thinking about slowing down its balance sheet reduction.

Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, discussed the Fed's effort to shrink its holdings during a public speech on Saturday, noting that the Fed's current pace of reduction — $95 billion of securities a month — is roughly double the pace of its previous tightening cycle in 2019. 

Logan said the quantitative tightening, or QT, process has been smooth so far, but has benefited from other developments that have caused usage of the Fed's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, or ON RRP, to dwindle faster than the runoff. Because of this, reserves — funds held by banks at the Fed — have not only been protected from mechanical destruction, but have instead been able to increase in recent months. 

""So, given the rapid decline of the ON RRP, I think it's appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow the runoff of our assets,"" she said. ""In my view, we should slow the pace of runoff as ON RRP balances approach a low level.""

Logan pointed to recent fluctuations in the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, or SOFR — an interest rate benchmark derived from spreads in overnight repurchase activity in Treasury securities — as a sign that reserves may be becoming scarce for some banks. 

While SOFR rates typically come in higher than the ON RRP rate, the spread between the two widened noticeably at the end of November and again at the end of December, by roughly one-tenth of a percentage point — indicating a slight uptick in borrowing demand by banks. This type of movement is not out of the ordinary, as banks often adjust their books at the end of months, quarters and years. But such spreads were smaller and less frequent during earlier stages of the QT process, according to Fed data.

""The emergence of typical month-end pressures suggests we're no longer in a regime where liquidity is super abundant and always in excess supply for everyone,"" Logan said in her remarks.

Before taking the top spot at the Dallas Fed in 2022, Logan oversaw the Fed's securities activities as the manager of the System Open Market Account during her tenure as vice president of the New York Fed. Her comments over the weekend echo concerns expressed by analysts who say the balance sheet wind-down could be happening faster than anticipated.

A slower approach to QT could have long-term benefits in normalizing the Fed's balance sheet, Logan said, by ""smoothing"" the redistribution of liquidity in the financial system and thus limiting the likelihood that the Fed would have to cut its reduction plan short.

The Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature without replacing them. This loss of assets is matched by falling government liabilities — including reserves, ON RRP, the Treasury's general account and cash in circulation, among others. The Fed has shrunk its balance sheet by roughly $1.3 trillion since the summer of 2022 and plans to continue doing so until reserves are at just above ""ample"" — a level at which banks can transact normally without feeling compelled to hoard reserves. 

Throughout the process, Fed officials have pointed to the ON RRP as a buffer against reserve scarcity. Little used since its creation in 2013, the facility — which allows money market funds and other nonbank counterparties to get paid interest for parking assets at the Fed overnight — ballooned in 2021, eventually rising to $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022. Logan and Fed Gov. Christopher Waller have argued that ON RRP usage equates to surplus liquidity in the financial system and should be able to return to effectively zero.

Since the start of the new year, ON RRP usage has hovered around $700 billion daily. Also, as Logan noted in her speech, a recent survey of senior financial officers indicates that most banks have more than the minimum amount of reserves they need to do business comfortably. Still, she cautioned that ON RRP usage and the amount of excess reserves are not a one-for-one measure and reserves are not distributed equally within the banking system. 

""While the current level of ON RRP balances provides comfort that liquidity is ample in aggregate, there will be more uncertainty about aggregate liquidity conditions as ON RRP balances approach zero,"" she said.",2024-01-14 07:16:15,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641228,46 days 08:13:36.641228,21,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/196a603/feds_logan_pump_the_brakes_on_quantitative/

1965jj9,stocks,"Morgan Stanley will pay $249 million to settle criminal, SEC block trade probes","&#x200B;

The SEC charged Morgan Stanley with “failing to enforce its policies concerning the misuse of material non-public information related to block trades,” that agency said.  
  
Block trades typically involve large numbers of shares of a company’s stock in privately arranged transactions executed outside public markets.  
  
The SEC said the bank generated more than $100 million in illicit profits as a result of misconduct by Pawan Passi, the former head of the bank’s U.S equity syndicate desk.  
  
Passi, 40, has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors, subject to approval by a judge. If Passi complies with the terms of that deal and demonstrates good behavior, he will not be prosecuted, prosecutors said.  
  
Passi was ordered to pay a $250,000 civil penalty by the SEC.  
  
Passi admitted that “from 2018 through August 2021, he promised sellers of certain equity blocks that Morgan Stanley would keep information concerning their potential sales confidential, knowing that he would disclose that information to buy-side investors and that those investors would use the information to trade in advance of the block sales,” according to prosecutors.

195y55e,stocks,"66% down on alibaba in a rather big position, thoughts?","please don't judge me, don't joke about it and only respond if you're serious.

Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)

around 60k in alibaba, at 185€

Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.

So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66€, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.

I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120€ / 180€, who knows.

Meanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.

For the last 3 years I thought ""let's wait and see"", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120€ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.

195j02j,stocks,"Hertz Wants to Sell 20,000 EVs Amid Low Rental Demand, High Repair Prices","Just over two years after announcing plans to purchase 100,000 Teslas and another 65,000 electric cars from Polestar for its rental fleets, Hertz is planning to sell off 20,000 of its EVs, according to a federal regulatory filing posted Thursday. The rental company noted the high cost of collision repairs and lower demand from consumers as the primary drivers for the EV divestment. Hertz, in turn, plans to use some of the income from those sales to purchase more new gas-powered vehicles.

The electric rental demand issue may have less to do with the cars themselves and more to do with the unique traits of EVs. An average renter is looking for a car that will get them around over the course of a trip rather than a compelling experience in that car. For those customers, the complexities of an EV may prove to be more of a frustration than a charm.

Renting a Tesla Model 3, for instance, comes with all the frustrations of the screen-heavy Tesla user interface without any of the time to get used to those adjustments that a buyer would have. Charging is an even bigger issue: Not only do consumers without EV experience who rent a Polestar 2 or a Tesla Model 3 have to figure out how to charge a car while on the road, they also have to figure out two completely different charging ecosystems depending on which car they get.

Even though Hertz plans to offload much of its electric fleet, the company says it ""will continue to execute its strategy around EV mobility and offer customers a wide selection of vehicles,"" according to the filing. Hertz says it will grow its charging infrastructure, work closer with electric car manufacturers to lower parts and labor costs, and continue to help educate customers about EVs.

Hertz currently lists 548 Tesla Model 3s and zero Polestar models on its direct sales website. The most affordable Teslas are currently selling for just over $20,000, but screenshots shared by Electrek on Wednesday suggest that other Model 3s have previously been listed for as low as $17,700 before a potential tax credit for used EVs.

1955x31,stocks,Critique the flaws in this trading strategy of using earnings reports,"The strategy is buying the stock of a company that will have an earnings report release in the morning. You buy the stock in pre-market at 9am. You then set a 2% stop loss. And finally, if the stop loss is not triggered, you sell it at 10am. These times are entirely arbitrarily chosen.

The strategy hinges on this hypothesis which may or may not be true: over the long-run, in the one hour period from 9am to 10am during the morning of a company's earnings release, there is a higher probability that the stock goes up in that period than down more than 2% (the stop loss). Why? Because of algorithms placing more buy orders during market open on an earnings day as opposed to other dates and times and not just algorithms but people in general. Even if the stock ends the day in the negatives, it could be that the period from 9am to 10am was positive and then it declines later in the day.

I am also aware that alternately, the stock could fluctuate between 9am to 10am leading to triggering the 2% stop loss before 10am, then ending up positive at 10am. So you effectively would have profited if you didn't have the stop loss which was triggered by bad luck. However, my hypothesis also assumes that this scenario is rare enough that the strategy would still work.

Obviously, I have no empirical data to back up that this hypothesis is true, it's just a hunch. I would love to have that data though and with enough work it's possible to accomplish.

Instead, all I have done is run some simulations to see what parameters are required for you to profit off of this strategy in the long run. Here is how the simulation was run:

**Variables:**

Stop loss %: 2% below purchase price at 9am

Probability of stop loss being triggered between 9am and 10am: 50% (arbitrarily chosen). This is the chance that the stop loss is triggered and includes the scenarios where the stop loss is triggered leading to a loss despite the stock ending up in the positive at 10am.

Average return if stop loss is not triggered: 1% (arbitrary)

Standard deviation of returns if stop loss is not triggered: 4% (arbitrary). With these two numbers, plugging it into a normal distribution, there is a 1.22% chance that a stock makes a 10% or higher return at 10am if you bought at 9am and didn't trigger the stop loss in between. I thought a 1.22% chance for a 10% or higher return was a reasonable assumption.

Commission: $10 USD for buy and sell

Starting Cash: $1000

**Steps in the simulation:**

1. Purchase the stock at 9am (subtract $5 commission). Cash is now $995
2. Generate random number between 0 and 1. If it is equal to or less than the probability of the stop loss being triggered then that means you triggered the stop loss and lost 2%. Subtract the commission of selling which is $5.
   1. Cash ends the day at $970.10
3. If you didn't trigger the stop loss, then generate a random number from the normal distribution with mean return of 1% and standard deviation of 4%. If the random return is 2% or below, regenerate a random number until it is not 2% or below. This is because if it were 2% or below then that would trigger the stop loss and at this stage we are assuming the stop loss was not triggered. Let's say the random return is 1.5%. Subtract $5 commission for selling.
   1. Cash is now $1010.00
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for 100 trials (each trial representing a different stock and day so like if you did this strategy on 100 different earnings days for 100 different stocks)

**Results:**

At the end of step 4 above, I calculated the return after the 100 days. Doing 100 days will count as 1 ""simulation"". I ran 100 simulations, so doing steps 1 - 4 100 times and calculated the average return at the end of doing the strategy for 100 days. Here are the results:

1. With the variables I mentioned above, the average return was -99.7% so not a very good strategy.
2. If we change the numbers to be more optimistic. For example, 2% stop loss, 20% chance of triggering the stop loss, 3% average return, 2% standard deviation of returns. In this extreme, the average return would be 351%. That's pretty crazy for doing 100 earnings report days. But, 20% chance of triggering the stop loss is pretty optimistic.
3. For a 50% chance of triggering the stop loss, what average return would we require to make a good profit? With an average return of 4.5% and standard deviation of 4%, after 1000 simulations, the average return at the end of the 100 days is 46% which is excellent. However, how realistic are these numbers? Probably not close to reality.
4. For an average return of 3.5%, standard deviation of 4%, and probability of triggering the stop loss of 40%, running 1000 simulations of the 100 days again, the average return at the end of the 100 days would be 64%
5. Changing the starting cash and stop loss % significantly affects the results too. With a starting cash of $1000, the $10 commission is a pretty large % of the cash you have and it's likelier that you hit $0 and lose. With $10,000 starting cash it's less likely you hit $0 and can withstand downturns during the 100 days to come out on top at the end of the simulation. If you change the stop loss from 2% to 1%, this drastically increases the chance that you will win. However, if you decrease the stop loss to 1% then the probability of triggering the stop loss prematurely increases too so there is a balance.
6. For example, with starting cash of $10,000, stop loss of 1%, stop loss probability of 50%, average return of 2%, standard deviation of returns of 4%, and running 1000 simulations, the final result is an average return of 52%.
7. Same parameters as #6 but with a probability of triggering the stop loss of 60% which means that on 60% of the days you will be losing 1% of your money, even with this you would make an average return of 11%.
8. With a starting cash $10,000, stop loss 1%, stop loss probability of 40%, average return 1%, standard deviation 2%, the average return at the end of the 100 days would be 12.6%. 

**Takeaways**

It is possible to collect enough data to find out the empirical answer to the variables above. You can find out historically, what the probability of triggering an X% stop loss between 9am and 10am on earnings days is. You can find out the average return and standard deviation. All of this is possible. You get the empirical numbers and plug them into the simulation, find the optimal stop loss % and then potentially this could be a very profitable strategy.",2024-01-12 21:10:31,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641287,47 days 18:19:20.641287,10,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1955x31/critique_the_flaws_in_this_trading_strategy_of/

194yz88,stocks,Citigroup cutting 10% of it's workforce,"Citigroup
 said it was cutting 10% of its workforce in a bid to help boost the embattled bank’s results and stock price.

About 20,000 employees will be let go over the “medium term,” New York-based Citigroup said Friday in a slideshow tied to fourth-quarter earnings. While it wasn’t immediately clear how long that is, the bank has previously used that term to denote a three-to-five-year period.

Citigroup had roughly 200,000 workers at the end of 2023, excluding Mexican operations that are in the process of being spun out, according to the presentation.

Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser announced a sweeping overhaul of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets in September. The company has been left behind by peers since the 2008 financial crisis as Fraser’s predecessors couldn’t get a handle on expenses, and is the lowest-valued among the six biggest U.S. banks.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

194o9yo,stocks,Nintendo Analysis_3 Management Team,"After reviewing the current management team of Nintendo, I really think Nintendo may have the best team in the game companies.   
The current President of Nintendo Shuntaro Furukawa is an experienced professional manager, he has rich experience in overseas operations and a strong financial background, the good successor of Kimishima Tatsumi, who led Nintendo at a difficult time. I think Kimishima has three material contributions to Nintendo, The first is the lead of Nintendo Switch, and published successfully. The second was to change Nintendo's competition plan and focus on product differences, which was called the new blue strategy. The Third is the most important, that was complete the company management generation change. He gave the right to Shuntaro as his success in Europe business and Switch released. And he promoted Shinya Takahashi, the talent of development team management and technology innovation, as the leader of EPD. Although Shigeru Miyamoto is still the leader of Nintendo game development, Nintendo has already formed a younger team including Koopa Troopa, Aonuma Eiji, and Nogami Hisashi.   
The new leader Shuntaro has new ideas on Nintendo development and thinks the IP international expansion is important. He accelerated Nintendo’s IP content development through more methods like mobile games, movies, and theme parks. This strategy succeeded after the Super Mario Movie brought good financial returns, and the short movie enhanced its game sales.   
Shigeru is a legendary game developer and still makes contributions to Nintendo, including IP content development. But I want to say more about Shinya, the current leader of EPD. Shinya is an experienced worker at Nintendo, joined in 1989. He was always responsible for Nintendo software development and focused on team coordination and development technologies innovation. He promoted 3D game content development and built a workable process of motion capture for Nintendo. I think Shuntaro and Shinya are good composites for Nintendo management, and in recent years Nintendo’s performance, including financial and share price, has proven that.  
The current marketing leader Satoru Shibata and hardware development manager Ko Shiota are experienced technicians, who can reinforce Nintendo’s overseas expansion and new console and parts development.  
In conclusion, Nintendo completed the management generation change in 2018, and it has a great management structure and rich human resource deposit. I think Shuntaro Furukawa and Shinya Takahashi can lead Nintendo better.",2024-01-12 06:22:36,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641321,48 days 09:07:15.641322,5,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194o9yo/nintendo_analysis_3_management_team/
194kuu0,stocks,Why does USFR have such a higher yield than all other money market funds?,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining, I hold USFR myself, but I can’t understand how it pays currently net 5.43% (**after** 0.15% fees) yet VMRXX which has **lower fees** (0.1%), pays 5.29%, in the market of risk-free rates that’s a huge difference. I can’t figure out how it’s able to yield such a higher amount, we’re talking about (before fees), consistently +0.25% more. How?

EDIT: I have figured it out, USFR is a FRN (floating rate note) treasury fund, very similar to short term treasuries & repos (MMFs) but it is a different product that *does* naturally pay a little bit more. MMFs are risk free because the price is locked in at $1 par, USFR is a traded ETF so its price isn’t locked (still extremely low risk such as short term treasuries), in consequence, slightly higher yield",2024-01-12 03:16:13,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641325,48 days 12:13:38.641326,13,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194kuu0/why_does_usfr_have_such_a_higher_yield_than_all/
194k7pd,stocks,How important is a stock being OTC + Sin? $EVVTY,"Hey everyone, just found out about $EVV.TY, an OTC online gambling company. 

On paper, it's an amazing company. 100% Gross margin. 63% EBIT margin. 58.4% Net Margin (No debt).

Revenue CAGR over past 5 years: 47% (Not organic, multiple acquisitions but core product is ~30%)

EBIT Margin Expansion over past 5 years: 26.5 points

EPS CAGR 5 yrGrowth: 58.8%

No Debt. Massive dilution due to acquisition.

Foward P/E is roughly 21x. You could expect a 10 yr CAGR of ~20% organically. Margins continue to expand. Capex light as it creates games so the cost to add another customer is close to 0.

 Sounds like the perfect company right? What am I missing?

Off the top of my head, my main concerns other than poor future revenue growth/margin contraction are

 1) Shareholder value (or lack thereof). The company as aforementioned as no debt but acquires companies using shares. While this isn't technically ""terrible"", I'd prefer not to get diluted.

2) Sin stock- Gambling regulation could cripple the company. The market generally dislikes vices.

3)FX risk. The Swedish Krona has been weak and creates yet another risk for the stock.

4) OTC- While not necessarily bad liquidity, nowhere near as liquid/transparent as public companies on nasdaq/nyse. I really wanted to see a 10-K but of course, they don't have one.

194ahz9,stocks,HIMS is undervalued and has a lot of potential,"Fellow bag chasers,

HIMS has the potential to be a game-changer. This is professional financial advice. Kidding ! I'd just like to hear your thoughts and opinions on the stock.

Why I'm Bullish on HIMS:

1) The company is well-positioned for growth in the healthcare industry. HIMS operates a telehealth platform that connects consumers to healthcare professionals. It offers a range of health and wellness products and services on its mobile app.  
  
The reason it’s going to be huge is because it provides prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. It’s the Amazon of healthcare. Most (70-80%) of doctor visits can be treated with prescription medication. HIMS allows clients to see doctors much faster and delivers their prescription to their homes. It’s cheaper, faster and more convenient than the traditional healthcare system. HIMS is going to disrupt pharmacies the same way Netflix disrupted Blockbuster.  
   
2) Strong product: HIMS boasts an impressive revenue growth of 52.6%, which proves their product is in high demand … and the demand keeps growing.  
  
3) Excellent balance sheet. No debt. Assets exceed liabilities.  
   
4) Currently undervalued : Considering HIMS solid performance, it remains undervalued compared to its peers. Simply Wall Street’s DCF Model has them 70% undervalued. This could be an excellent buying opportunity for investors looking to get in early on a potential breakout.  


Risks to consider :   


1) Competition. HIMS has no direct competitor. No one offers eConsultation and ePharmacy combined. Teledoc would be the closest thing to a direct competitor. That being said, Amazon is interested in delivering prescribed medication. Huge companies have a harder time with rapid innovation and competing is easier said than done, but one has to respect a player like Amazon.  
   
2) Share dilution (HIMS is currently unprofitable)

I am going on vacation starting tomorrow and won’t be able to post until Tuesday- best of luck to you all!

No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and **are NOT predictions of stock price EOD**. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.

**SPEC, liquidity 7/10** – Has partnered with MLab to bring Airecore emissions measurement system to European trucking market. (small cap stock under $500M, be careful with this one)

**HTZ, liquidity 7/10-** Confirmed that it is selling 1/3rd of it’s global EV fleet (20K car), reported Q4 prelim earnings as well/.

**NVDA, liquidity 6/10**\- Broke all times highs- worth watching additional all time highs and seeing if there’s a short in there anywhere.  Likely going to start a “starter” short today.

**DCGO, liquidity 7/10 - Reported earnings and is currently the target of a short report- DCGO employees have claimed that it is engaging in Medicare fraud. Worth looking at the chart yesterday and looking into a small swing trade long in this.**

**JNPR, liquidity 9/10** – HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.

1944428,stocks,Starbucks has to open a new store every 3 days to reach its goal in India,"With India poised to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030, Starbucks is doubling down on the burgeoning market.

Tata Starbucks, a joint venture between Starbucks and Tata Consumer Products, plans to operate 1,000 cafes in India, the company announced yesterday (Jan. 8).

Starbucks currently has 390 stores across India. To meet the new lofty goal, the coffee chain will need to execute one new store opening every three days, CEO Laxman Narasimhan said during a visit to India.

It sounds like a herculean task — but it’s only a little bit more of a push than what Starbucks has already been doing. “We have opened one store every five days,” Narasimhan said in a CNBC interview published today (Jan. 9).

Starbucks needs the push now more than ever. A win in India is especially crucial after China relegated the US-based coffee giant to the No. 2 spot there, behind the homegrown Luckin Coffee.

1941upw,stocks,Ubisoft(UBI) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADIVCE*** 

# Introduction:

Ubisoft has been the fortunate party to be on the benefiting end of the Microsoft-Activision merger. Essentially receiving the catalog of ATVI's IPs including new releases up till 2038 to add on to their subscription service Ubisoft+. However, complaints of the lack of originality of new releases from UBI, delayed/canceled releases of games, and a subscription service that is priced too high for the value it provides are all issues that UBI faces. It seems that new releases are re-modeled replicas of the previous release. Ubisoft is starting to become less like a video game developer and more like a video game factory assembly line.

# Revenue:

Overall, for forecasting revenue I took into account that UBI has many of their highly anticipated mobile titles such as “Rainbow Six Siege Mobile” and “Tom Clancy The Division” being released in 2024, this is a strong step into the large mobile market for UBI. I ran 3 possible scenarios 1) UBI continues growing their player base Y/Y 2) UBI hemorrhages players somewhere in my forecast, and the ones that stick around are the players that are subscribed to Ubisoft+ 3) Market Scenario, the scenario that the market expects.

***SCENARIO 1***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/MSvHt3W)\]

For scenario 1, I assumed that the player count would continuously grow.   
When forecasting the number of active players, I assumed there would be a spike in player count for the first half of my forecast before tapering off as UBI acquires a significant portion of their most eager customers.  
When forecasting Revenue/Active Players, I believe that a significant portion of active players will come from the purchase of Ubisoft+. So I assumed that the revenue/active players would experience significant growth in the first half of my forecast before tapering off as customers purchasing Ubisoft+ may just be trying it out or may end up not like the Ubisoft+ service.

Ubisoft would be priced at $202.75 per share for Scenario 1.

&#x200B;

***SCENARIO 2***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/undCbK0)\]

For scenario 2, I assumed that the player count would grow for the first half of my forecast before facing a slight decline.  


When forecasting the number of active players, I assumed there would be a spike in player count for the first half of my forecast as UBI rolls out ATVI's IPs and their anticipated mobile IPs. Before it begins to hemorrhage to reflect that certain customers are just trying out Ubisoft's IPs.

When forecasting Revenue/Active Players, I assumed that the revenue/active players would experience meager growth in the first half of my forecast before tapering off.

Ubisoft would be priced at $187.06 per share for Scenario 2.

&#x200B;

***MARKET SCENARIO***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/dXaL0mP)\]

For the Market Scenario, the player count and average revenue/active player continuously declined.

The market expects Active Player count to decline from 133M to 27M reflecting a growing negative sentiment around Ubisoft's new IPs and they are mainly propped by a few notable IPs that are strongly supported by a small loyal fanbase. It also shows how little faith the market has in UBI given its negative history of canceling releases, not hitting forecasts, and poor plans made by management. 

# Cost:

When forecasting cost, I took into account that UBI believes AI can be used in areas such as developing NPCs or making maps more interactive. There are 4 main costs that UBI faces Cost of Goods Sold, R&D and Marketing, and SG&A.  
  
When forecasting the Cost of Goods Sold, I assumed that it tended downwards as AI gets more involved in the development process reducing the total number of developers needed to make a game.   
  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Marketing, opting for less granularity I assumed that they would follow historic trends and took the historic average.  
  


# WACC:

France has a bond rating of “AA-”  
AA Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 0.58%  
France 10Y Treasury Bond yield (1M Avg)  3.24%   
RFR = 2.66%  
  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xlsx)) = 4.60%  
France ERP = 5.18%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://www.infrontanalytics.com/fe-EN/30289EF/Ubisoft-Entertainment-SA/Beta)) = 0.54%  
COE = 5.46%  
  
UBI has no bond rating so I took a look at synthetic rating. ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ratings.html))  
FY22 operating profit was negative so I used FY21’s interest coverage ratio instead.  
FY21 Interest Coverage Ratio = 14.3x  
Based on Synthetic Rating UBI should be rated “AAA”. However, a company cannot be more stable than the government in the country they reside in. So UBI is rated “AA”  
AA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.88%  
France Marginal Tax Rate = 25.00%  
COD = 3.66%  
  
Stock Price (5D Avg) = $22.75  
Shares O/S = 121.15M  
Market Value of Equity = 2756.16M  
As UBI doesn’t break down their “Bank Borrowings” by duration other than <1 Year or >1 Year I assumed that >1 Year meant <6 Years.  
Weighted average maturity = 4 Years.  
FY22 Interest Expense = 36.00M  
Market Value of Debt = 1947.89M  
%Debt = 41.4%  
%Equity = 58.6%  
WACC = 4.71%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately, I believe that the large market pessimism surrounding UBI can be attributed to its unreliable release date and consistently negative performance in the past few years. These factors create a lot of uncertainty around UBI on whether or not they can fully utilize their IPs. I believe that UBI's plans into the mobile market was a good move as the mobile market has very large untapped potential. But, considering the current trending titles on the mobile market, UBI's mobile entrants do not fit that bill. UBI has to reconsider its current IPs and allow innovation rather than releasing games that feel similar to each other or bump up its efforts in creating new IPs.

1941aun,stocks,Bitcoin ETF Approvals Are Bad for MicroStrategy,"Microstrategy is an inefficient structure for Bitcoin ownership.  Bitcoin gains are taxed as capital gains and can get long-term capital gains treatment if owned by an individual through an ETF.  MSTR is a C corp and must pay income tax on realized Bitcoin gains.  They must repurchase shares or pay dividends to return that capital to a shareholder.  At the top marginal tax rate, an incremental $1 of bitcoin gains through MSTR is worth $.63 to a shareholder.  Using a Bitcoin ETF in a normal account, an incremental $1 of gains is worth $.80.  In a tax-advantaged account, the gain could be worth up to $.79 through MSTR and $1 in an ETF.  It doesn’t matter if they don’t plan to sell the Bitcoin.  The government has a claim on the gains; Bitcoin with an unrealized gain through a C corp will always be worth less to an investor.

Some claim MSTR is a profitable software company that can plow its earnings back into more Bitcoin, which is valuable.  While there might be a benefit here, one doesn’t need to consider it.  On an LTM basis, MSTR has not generated operating cash flows in excess of stock compensation for 7 quarters.  LTM operating cash has been negative for three quarters, even with stock compensation.  MSTR can currently only use equity offerings and debt issuance to add more coins.

|Report date|9/22|12/22|3/23|6/23|9/23|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LTM Stock Comp ($M)|59.7|63.6|66.8|67.0|66.9|
|LTM Op CF ($M)|24.7|3.2|(3.1)|(0.7)|(6.7)|

In light ETF approvals, MSTR has lost its luster.  It used to be a quirky vehicle through which one could get BTC exposure in public markets.  Now, it has all the tax disadvantages of a C-corp and the liquidity issues of the Grayscale Trust.  There are better ways to get Bitcoin exposure now; MSTR’s experiment is obsolete.

MSTR is also less liquid than an ETF.  ETFs have authorized participants that use arbitrage to ensure the market price reflects the value of the underlying assets.  MSTR cannot do this efficiently.  If shares were to fall below NAV, the best method of establishing price/value parity would be repurchasing shares.  As previously mentioned, MSTR’s software business does not generate sufficient cash flows to do this.  They would need to sell assets, potentially realizing gains.

The title may be a touch misleading at first, while they do talk about a Canadian specific financial stuff such as TFSA's ,RRSP's, Canadian real estate ect, the vast majority of the show is based around equities. They do talk about some (very good) Canadian companies, but more so US equities, a bit of crypto ect. They get guest on the show from time to time that have some awesome hot takes.

I would love to hear what podcasts you guys are into. As long as it's not motley fool, or mad money lol.  That shit is trash.

Edit: damn, tons of feed back. Looks like I have a lot of podcast to check out. 

I was planning on checking out a few podcasts on my way down to Edmonton. I started off with acquired. Listened to the episode on visa. This podcast blew me away. It's impressive  how they made a 4.5 hours long podcast that kept me intrigued the entire time. Brilliant stuff. Due to the length, this was the only one I have been able to look into so far, but I will definitely dredge my way through the recommendation.

Thanks for all the great content suggestions! ",2024-01-11 05:37:25,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641414,49 days 09:52:26.641414,86,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/193u6z6/what_are_your_favorite_financial_podcasts_these/
193rji9,stocks,Nintendo Anysis_2 Comparison,"Sorry, I can't upload pictures here.

**Growth**  
Nintendo 3 years average growth is 7%, and EPS growth is 20%. The revenue growth is lower compared with its peers, like Play Station and Xbox. The EPS growth is good, but not outstanding, lower than game developers Capcom, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix. Koei Tecmo and Capcom have delivered impressive growth in the last three years. Play Station and Take-Two achieved high revenue growth but did not drive their profit increase.  
From the growth data comparison, I think Nintendo needs new drivers for the next generation. It plans to increase capital investment in IP expansion and initiate more people access to its dedicated game platform, but I think it not be the main driver in the next competition.  
**Profit**  
Nintendo has good profit margins with a gross margin of 55% and an operating margin of 32%. This is higher than most competitors. Koei Tecmo and Capcom are more attractive, but they don't have a platform. Compared with Sony Play Station and Sega, Nintendo's performance is better. I can't find the margin data of the Gaming business from Microsoft's financial report, so I use the personal segment data, maybe this is not exact.  
Although Nintendo has a decline in cash turnover compared with its history, Nintendo did much better than its competitors. Considering its good margins, I think Nintendo has strong profitability and return.  
**Returns**  
Nintendo has an outstanding investment return of 46% and an equity return of 21% compared with its competitors, especially in investment return. I think this benefited from a great composite of solid margins and a high cash turnover rate.  
Again, I use the company's whole business ROE of Microsoft as I can't get the gaming sector number to calculate it. Considering Microsoft's main business is office software and cloud, this ROE number may not be comparable. ROIC is re-calculated by gaming sector data, and so is Sony Gaming & Network business, Nintendo is performing much better in ROIC than Microsoft Xbox and Sony Play Station.   
**Capital Structure**  
All game companies here have low financial leverage with a leverage ratio below 0.5 except Sony. Nintendo has no debt on the balance sheet and strong solvency ability.   
Every company's Debt to EBITDA is below 4, which means their financial is health and has no insolvency risk.  
**Valuation & Dividend**  
Nintendo has a better valuation compared with its main competitors, after the recent soaring of price, Nintendo's current EV/EBIT is 13.68x, it's a little higher than the median line of 13x. I think Nintendo's valuation is not expensive considering its current solid financial performance in the first half of FY2023 and the potential to open another growth cycle through new console releases.  
As a potential new Switch release this year, we can see some clues from its data in history. Nintendo's EV/EBIT was 15.03x and 30.8x in 2006 and 2016, which is the year the new console was released. Of course, I assume Nintendo's next Switch will perform like Wii and Switch, not Wii U. After the new console is released, Nintendo's market cap increased by 2.5x and 1x in the following 2 years, its EV/EBIT is stable and declined little compared with the released year, which means Nintendo delivers rich profit returns after the new console is released. Back today, Nintendo's valuation multiple is lower than in history, but its market role is still strong, and financial performance is solid, this is not a very high risk to bet its good returns on the eve of a new Switch release.  
Nintendo has a good dividend payout ratio of around 50% compared with peers, which will define Nintendo as a value stock. I think Nintendo is not very attractive for buy-and-hold investors as it has highly volatile growth and market value, but it's a special opportunity you should consider when it prepares to add fuel to its tank, and you already know it's not too expensive, and has a stable dividend payout.  
**Big Three Comparison**  
As a game company with hardware and software, Nintendo's main competitors are Sony's Play Station and Microsoft's Xbox. To compare more clearly, I searched some data focusing on the three companies and their gaming business operating results, this can help me get a clear picture to understand the market position of the three companies. As Microsoft's gaming business data is not disclosed too much, the comparison focuses on Sony and Nintendo. All data used from the last quarterly financial report.  
From growth data, Play Station has the highest revenue growth but the lowest profit growth, while Nintendo has the highest profit growth and moderates revenue growth. Microsoft has the lowest revenue growth and higher profit growth. I think all three companies perform well, but I prefer Nintendo because it balances well in revenue and profit growth, you can see more growth in revenue can drive higher profit growth. Xbox X & S has bad sales compared with Switch and PS5. Microsoft may release its new console this year and maybe increase some market shares, especially after it acquired Activision Blizzard. But I don't believe this can change the market structure. Maybe Microsoft has another idea to get money from gaming competition, providing cloud technologies and promoting cloud gaming development. You know, Nintendo online playing uses cloud services from Azure.  
Play station's revenue was boosted by PS5 sales. Sony finally prepared enough stock to sell in the shop, you can find PS5 in every gaming shop and Costco. Sony's G & N business doing well this year, but its margin is too low compared with the other two. Sony has tonnes of popular IPs and first-party studios, I think it can do better in the gaming market and up its margin.  
Moving to hardware and software sales data, Sony has the highest volume sold in console and software which is driven by PS5. Nintendo achieved surprising console sold and solid software titles sold, but I think Switch volume growth will not persist, and Nintendo needs to prepare something to compete with PS5 and the new Xbox. Microsoft's Xbox X & S has walked to the end of its life as the lowest console sold compared with others. I hope to see its new Xbox this year.  
For Player and platform member data, Xbox has more active users but I think this is surpassed by Play Station as Sony has said its active users achieved 123m in its CES two days later. Sony currently has bigger subscribers compared with Nintendo Online and Microsoft GPX. Nintendo has 38m subscribers, which is in the middle.   
The cumulative console sold data tells me Nintendo is the biggest one in the market, but considering the Switch is a very old console, I decided to add PS4 and Xbox ONE back, after adding, Sony is the biggest one with a total of 157m units sold, and Nintendo is 132m sold, Xbox is still the lowest units sold of 77.6m. The video game market is still dominated by Sony and Nintendo.  
**Conclusion**  
Nintendo is doing well compared with its competitors with high-quality growth, strong margins, turnover and investment return, lower insolvency risk, and fair valuation. But Nintendo's growth is already showing signs of weakness, and I think the recent growth in Switch is driven by Legend of Zelda Tears of Kingdom. This trend will not persist in the next year without new console or titles, especially at the time the PS5 Slim has been released and the new Xbox coming. Sony and Nintendo have dominated the video gaming world, and from market shares, Sony is even better than Nintendo. But Sony Play Station's low profitability is putting it in the shadow of Nintendo.

In terms of the stock, it is currently trading at $26.81. Its 1-yr target price (via yahoo and tipranks) is at $32.25. Alphaspread has its intrinsic value and dcf value well above its trading price as well, both at around $43. Overall, most analysts have it as a moderate-to-strong buy. Other reasons to look at it is its eps growth compared to the industry average, at 8.1% vs -14.6% predicted for this year (it has also outperformed historically if that counts for anything). It's free cash flow has also increased at a rate of 24.3% over the last 3-5 years compared to the industry's -.8%.

193o61e,stocks,How can I know — Which underlying security does an F share represent ?,"""F shares"" are created by US broker-dealers to show quotes of foreign securities in USD ([source: FAQ on F Shares - OTC Markets](https://money.stackexchange.com/q/137969)). If I know the symbol of an F share, is there a way I can know exactly which foreign underlying security the F share represents? By ""exactly"", I mean country/exchange/ticker information or even the ISIN of the underlying.

For example, I happen to know that RBGPF is the F share of the London Stock Exchange listing of Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. (LSE symbol: RB, ISIN: GB00B24CGK77), but that is only because there is lots of information about this company around the internet. If I am looking at the F share of a thinly-traded and obscure security, it may be difficult to conclusively determine what the underlying security is, especially when the issuer also has multiple share classes, preferred stock issues, exchange-traded warrants, or rights issues. Previously, I used FINRA's [OTC Daily List](https://money.stackexchange.com/q/137969) to find the underlying securities, but not all F shares are on the list (probably because some of those F shares were created decades ago).

In other words, is there a central regulatory authority that registers F shares? If so, are the registration documents publicly available? If so, where can I obtain those documents?

193it8c,stocks,TSMC posts flat Q4 revenue but beats expectations,"TAIPEI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) reported a largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and market's expectations.  
The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.  
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.

That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.

193goz9,stocks,Wondering about ethical investing,"Hello everyone 

I started investing a few years ago and made really great returns 20-40% a year. Which is amazing.

But, further research led me to know these companies practice what i consider to be unethical.

What's not ethical?

Wages below founding countries minimum/adjusted for other equivalence in other countries. No slave labor or slave gathering of resources. Aka Apple

Killing of innocent. Animals or people. ( Ethical farming is fine, even the slaughting of animals im referring to factory farming or arms companies. Id say even hunting weapons are fine ) 

Fucking up environment. Water sources, air, etc

Fucked up working conditions

The only thing that comes to mind is building your own ethical company, reits in a country with high standards or potentially bitcoin.

I dont care that people use money for drugs. Tobacco is fine, we're adults who make our own decisions. I think making someone harvest your tobacco for a dollar an hour is unethical, though.

All currency is used for crime. I do wonder about the environmental impact on crypto vs like physical gold mining. 

Basically, it feels like im stealing other people hard worked underpaid hours so i can retire earlier.

When the reality is i didn't choose to be born in Canada, this is complete luck. Just as the chinese man didn't choose to be born there, it was just complete luck.

So is it ethical to steal his hard earned wages so i can retire early?

Any thoughts and words are appreciated.

Indeed, EV market has been developing very fast over the last couple of years, there are many players in the market competing for a larger pie as a whole.

While different brands may give different values to its customers, suppose more competition will lead to thinner profit margin and probably higher R&D as well as SG&A costs. 

That said, business performance / profitability of EV companies may experience pressure in 2024.

I’ve since made a few thousand off of it and now seems like a great time to buy before Q1 of 2024. They’ve had a lot of contracts come in due to China’s desire to invade Taiwan. They have good sales and have been exceeding expected EPS. Also their financials like net profit and revenue are very promising. They spiked to $16 in August of last year but are sitting at $10/$11 right now. It seems likely China is going to take Taiwan it’s just a matter of when and that is going to result in domestic production of superconductors/microchips to drastically rise.[Taiwan makes 65% of the world’s semiconductors and almost 90% of the advanced chips](https://www.voanews.com/a/race-for-semiconductors-influences-taiwan-conflict-/6696432.html#) so if China is able to take over Taiwan the whole world would have a drastic shortage.

No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and **are NOT predictions of stock price EOD**.

**GRFS, liquidity 8/10** – Though this has mostly come back from the selloff from the short report, still worth watching for additional spikes down to potentially counter.

**NVDA, liquidity 7/10- Stock has hit all time highs, interested in reversing some up-spikes. Next major level I’m watching is 550.**

192rw11,stocks,Home price gains are surging from a decline in mortgage rates.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/09/home-prices-surge-detroit-gains-beat-miami.html

* Home prices are rising faster and faster each month, fueled by a decline in mortgage rates.
* States in the Northeast led the gains, with Rhode Island (11.6%), Connecticut (10.6%) and New Jersey (10.5%) seeing the strongest growth. 
* Home prices are surging — and Detroit gained the most in November, beating Miami for the first time
* Home prices jumped 5.2% on an annual basis in November.
* Detroit saw the largest annual price gain, surpassing Miami.


On a national level, home prices jumped 5.2% in November compared to the same month a year earlier, according to a new report from analytics firm CoreLogic. That’s up from a 4.7% annual gain in October.

States in the Northeast led the gains, with Rhode Island (11.6%), Connecticut (10.6%) and New Jersey (10.5%) seeing the strongest growth. Areas seeing year-over-year price declines in November were Idaho (-1.3%); Utah (-0.4%); and Washington, D.C. (-0.2%).

“This continued strength remains remarkable amid the nation’s affordability crunch but speaks to the pent-up demand that is driving home prices higher,” Selma Hepp, chief economist for CoreLogic, said in a release. “Markets where the prolonged inventory shortage has been exacerbated by the lack of new homes for sale recorded notable price gains over the course of 2023,” she added.

The lower the mortgage rate, the greater the buying power for consumers. While prices are expected to soften slightly later next year, much of that will depend on supply. At current low supply levels and demand increasing due to lower mortgage rates, for now at least, prices have nowhere to go but up.

After hitting more than a dozen record lows in the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, mortgage rates began rising sharply in 2022 and hit a more than 20-year high in October last year. The average rate on the 30-year fixed loan briefly crossed over 8%. It has since fallen back and is now in the high 6% range.

**Detroit topples Miami**

On the city level, Detroit saw the largest annual price gain at 8.7%, surpassing Miami, which came in at 8.3%, according to CoreLogic. Miami had held the top spot for 16 months.

“Detroit lagged appreciation during the pandemic so some of this was a catch up,” said Hepp. “Other Mid-west areas [are] seeing stronger appreciation because they’re more affordable.”

While the median price of a home in Detroit is still among the most affordable in the nation, the market is considered overvalued due to local income levels.

Roughly 82% of the nation’s 397 metropolitan housing markets surveyed by CoreLogic were considered overvalued. That means Detroit’s home prices are overly high compared with local household incomes. Notably, large cities considered “normal” in valuation were Boston; Chicago; Los Angeles; and Washington, D.C.

“It really depends on who is buying in the area, and we’ve seen more higher income folks buying in those areas,” Hepp said.",2024-01-09 22:36:43,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641508,50 days 16:53:08.641509,179,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/192rw11/home_price_gains_are_surging_from_a_decline_in/

The complaint, filed on December 19 in federal court in New York, was filed on behalf of investors in Spirit AeroSystems, which was originally a manufacturing unit of Boeing until it was spun off in 2005 (The company has no relationship with Spirit Airlines.) According to the suit, Spirit relies heavily on Boeing for orders and manufactures much of the aviation giant's jet fuselages.

...

The lawsuit is noteworthy because of its allegations of manufacturing problems, including a complaint from one Spirit employee who alleged an ""excessive amount of defects"" in an email to one of the company's executives.

192of49,stocks,Analysis: Why solar is the best place to mark your money in 2024.,"Disclosure: I am heavily invested (200k) in $TAN shares and calls and opened a position in December.  


  
Right now, $TAN is criminally undervalued with an aggregate P/E ratio of 11 in contrast to the S&P which is nearly 25 and QQQ which is 33. There are significant near, mid and long term tailwinds are it relates to the industry. I have a price target between $90 - $120 for TAN at the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025. One could pick an individual solar stock for higher upside (FSLR, SEDG, ENPH) but an ETF limits your downside risk.  
Short-term bull cases:  


  
\#1: The Fed has signaled that it will cut interest rates soon which is a massive driver for residential solar stocks, which are heavily influenced by borrowing. In other words, most people in purchasing a solar system for their home borrow money in order to do so. Lower interest rates = less expensive loans = more solar system purchases.  


  
\#2: The upcoming election. Biden is a big proponent of the solar industry and there are massive subsidies under this administration that could continue in the coming years. The younger generation (millennials and generation z) consistently ranks climate change and green energy as their most important voting points. Additionally, these generations are now of home-owning age (meaning more customers to purchase residential solar systems).  


  
\# 3: The war in the middle east. At this point it's pretty clear that the war in Israel and the surrounding Arab countries is escalating and the war in Ukraine might also be related, given the alliances between Russia & other major oil exporters. When the middle east has gotten in wars, what has it historically done? Cut oil production. Guess what is a major driver for solar investment? Oil prices.  


  
\# 4: There is currently an oversupply of solar materials as a result of elevated interest rates in the past couple of years. Solar producers have tightened up their productions lines as a result. When interest rates come down and other factors (such as increased oil costs as a result from # 3, and increased subsidies from # 2), I believe people will flood into solar as they have already done in the past. This means that the short term price of solar could increase, driving up company revenues and sales.  


  
Long-term bull cases:  
\# 1: The future of energy is green, and most people unilaterally accept or agree with this premise. Solar energy is by far the cheapest and fastest way to decarbonize our energy sources.  


  
\# 2: Solar materials are becoming cheaper, which opens up to a broader consumer base.  


  
\# 3: In the last decade the adoption of solar as a power source has grown annually at an average of 24% with no signs of slowing down in the longer term.  


  
\# 4: The growth of crypto mining (particularly bitcoin) has made solar farms crop up like toadstools after a hard rain. There are literally farms in western texas that exist ONLY to supply electricity for bitcoin mining rigs. Given the increases in bitcoin price -> more mining -> more solar purchases to fund mining operations.",2024-01-09 20:18:29,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641525,50 days 19:11:22.641525,44,0.49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/192of49/analysis_why_solar_is_the_best_place_to_mark_your/

HTZ seems crazy to me, the company is in and out of bankruptcy and the rumors on the internets about its service failures are plentiful.  BNTX, by contrast, seems like a stock that could well justify the risks, and the company actually has net earnings, which is nice.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

19296f7,stocks,Nintendo Analysis_1,"**Revenue & Profit Growth**  
The revenue growth of Nintendo is highly volatile depending on the new consoles and titles it released.  
Nintendo has two big revenue growth records in the past 23 years. The first was in 2007, Nintendo achieved big sales in Wii and NDS Lite with their software worldwide after it released them in 2006. Wii was a success in the 7th console competition as it attracted more people to convert to players and expanded the whole game market, especially Wii has a high-profit margin compared with Xbox360 and PS3. But after that, Nintendo lost the whole next-generation competition. Nintendo's revenue and profit declined from 2010 to 2017, because the sales were full for Wii and NDS, and the successor Wii U failed in competition with PlayStation 4. Nintendo was too conservative in products, and its share price crashed in those years.  
Nintendo released its new console Switch in 2017 and achieved big success in the market. Nintendo has had the highest revenue and profit growth in the past, but again, the growth only persists for 4 years, and the new OLED Switch cannot inject much fuel for Nintendo compared with PS5. Although the last half-year financial report showed Switch and its software still have growth in its seventh year, especially in software, benefitting the Zelda successor release and the hit Super Mario Movie, I think it's time to update the new console and open the next growth cycle.  
The other good thing is Nintendo's revenue and profit growth are high  
a positive relationship, which means its revenue growth can drive profit.   
From the growth data, we know we can invest in Nintendo when it releases new console and titles, but we don't know if the new console will succeed in the market. I hope Nintendo can bring us new fun in the future.  
**Revenue Quality**  
Nintendo's cash conversion rate is bad because most time the rate of operating cash flow to net income is below 1. And this ratio has been around 0.5 in the last 2 years. The reasons are an increase in inventory and profit, and gains in equity investment and foreign exchange. I know some of them are not regular things, but this conversion rate is not good for me.  
**Margins**  
Nintendo's profit profit-earning ability enhanced after Switch was released in 2017. Its gross margin climbed to 55% and its operating margin jumped to 31% in 2023, much higher than the average of the past 20 years.  
I think Nintendo's margin is volatile too, not like Bandai's stable expansion, its margins are high related to new consoles and titles released. I don't like much volatile margin for a company, which means its advantage is thin and weak.   
Nintendo finds a way to compete with Sony and Xbox. Not just the console's functionalities, it is the integration of console, IP, and games, and keep expanding user scale to enter their IP world. Of course, Nintendo has seen the fuel in the console and game sales through its IP expansion strategy.  
I still notice the total tiles sold in the Switch platform has declined from last year, even though it is a high number compared with years before COVID-19. Nintendo must think about new drivers for the next generation competition, although they want to break the rules of console life. I believe the Switch will perform well in its eighth year as a scale console sold and keep releasing new titles in 2024. I would like to see some news about the new console from Nintendo this year, not only from the player but also the investor.  
**Turnover**  
Nintendo has a good cash turnover rate which expresses its dominant role in game title issuing before 2010. But things changed after Sony and Microsoft entered this sector. Nintendo's cash and inventory turnover has declined in recent years, which is the second-highest level in its history. I think this is some affected by capex increase recently. Although this number is good for game developers, I would like to see more efficiency in cash use.  
**Asset & Capital Structure**  
After Nintendo's domination breakdown by Sony and Xbox, Nintendo's AR increased in the last ten years but declined recently, and inventory climbed in the Covid period, similar to peers.  
I think Nintendo's operating and fixed assets are stable with business and PPE will increase in the following years as the new R&D headquarters develops.  
As a Japanese company, Nintendo has very low financial leverage with strong solvency.  
**Returns & Valuation**  
Nintendo has had good investment returns in the past as most time its ROIC exceeds its WACC. Equity return is not outstanding, most times below 12%, but moved better in recent years, I think it's benefitted the Switch sale and IP expansion.   
Nintendo's return data is express cycle character too and decline slowly in the past 2 years. This is another signal of the need to refresh its product portfolio.  
Nintendo's valuation is good as its profit increased around 6x and the price has just increased 1.8x in the last seven years. I think Nintendo's price is fair, but maybe expensive after its price soared after the second-quarter results were released. 

  
**Conclusion**  
Nintendo is a great company with high innovation ability, evergreen IP, and an expanded client base. However, its financial result is highly volatile and relies on its console and title release. This makes Nintendo like a cycle stock. The Switch has given Nintendo the confidence to say no to the console life rule in this sector, and it achieved another strong sales half year. This is impressive but I am still concerned about some data, like declined equity returns and cash turnover, and its low cash conversion.   
As 2024 is the eighth year of Switch and many rumors about the Switch2 release plan, I think Nintendo has a high probability of opening a new growth tunnel if it new console is released this year. Maybe this is the right timing to build some positions and wait for that, compared to Wii, Switch's long life and good performance have decline many investment risks.",2024-01-09 07:32:02,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641577,51 days 07:57:49.641577,8,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19296f7/nintendo_analysis_1/

191zpze,stocks,United Airlines finds loose bolts on several Boeing 737 Max 9s after grounding,"Edit: Alaska is reporting that more of their 737 Max 9's have loose bolts: https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/ (thank you to AP9384629344432 for linking this)

**Original post:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/united-airlines-737-max-9-inspections-turn-up-loose-bolts.html

United Airlines said Monday that it has found loose bolts on door plugs of several Boeing 737 Max 9 planes during inspections spurred when a panel of that type blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight at 16,000 feet last week.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday grounded dozens of 737 Max 9s after the panel blew out midflight on Alaska Flight 1282, calling for inspections.

United has 79 of the Max 9 planes in its fleet and is the biggest operator of the jet model.

""Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug — for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,"" United said in a statement. ""These findings will be remedied by our Tech Ops team to safely return the aircraft to service.""

Plane manufacturer Boeing said earlier Monday it issued instructions to airlines to conduct the inspections of the Max 9s in their fleets. United had begun some preliminary inspection work in the past few days.

No one was seriously injured in the accident aboard the Alaska Airlines flight, though the blown-out panel produced a force so violent that some headrests and seatbacks were ripped from the cabin and the cockpit door was flung open, according to initial details of a federal safety investigation. No passengers were seated in the two seats next to the panel.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the accident would have been worse at cruising altitude when passengers and crews are walking around the cabin.

But the accident places fresh scrutiny on Boeing, which has spent years trying to clean up a host of quality defects, while also ramping up aircraft production, including of the 737 Max. CEO Dave Calhoun has spent months trying to assure airlines, investors and financial analysts that the company is improving its supply chain and working to resolve its quality problems.

Calhoun canceled a company leadership summit this week and plans to hold an all-employee call on Tuesday.

Alaska Airlines, which is set to inspect its fleet of more than 60 737 Max 9s, didn't immediately comment on whether it, too, has found loose bolts.

The FAA declined to comment on United's findings. Boeing didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The 737 Max is Boeing's best-selling aircraft, with more than 4,000 orders to fill. However, the more common Max 8, which is not affected by the grounding, makes up the majority of those orders.

Aviation publication The Air Current first reported that United had discovered the loose bolts.",2024-01-08 23:35:26,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641592,51 days 15:54:25.641592,218,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191zpze/united_airlines_finds_loose_bolts_on_several/

191y0f6,stocks,Offices Around America Hit a New Vacancy Record,"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record-166d98a5

* A staggering 19.6% of office space in major U.S. cities wasn’t leased as of the fourth quarter, according to Moody’s Analytics, up from 18.8% a year earlier. That is slightly above the previous records of 19.3% set in 1986 and 1991 and the highest number since at least 1979, which is as far back as Moody’s data go.

America’s offices are emptier than at any point in at least four decades, reflecting years of overbuilding and shifting work habits that were accelerated by the pandemic.

The new record shows how remote work has upended the office market. But that is only part of the story. Much of the market’s current malaise traces its roots to the office-market downturn of the ’80s and ’90s.

That surge in office vacancies in the 1980s and early 1990s followed years of overbuilding. Easy lending fueled a construction boom, particularly in the South where land was cheap and red tape sparse. Banks often financed speculative office projects that didn’t have any tenants signed up.

“The building I built was almost a million square feet—100% empty,” said developer Bruce Eichner, who built the Manhattan office tower 1540 Broadway in the 1980s.

The result was a glut of office buildings that couldn’t find tenants when the economy went into recession in 1990 as the country suffered from the savings-and-loan crisis, when many S&Ls failed.

That glut weighs on the office market to this day and helps explain why vacancies are far higher in the U.S. than in Europe or Asia. Many office parks built in the 1980s and earlier struggle to find tenants as companies cut back on space or leave for more modern buildings.

“The bulk of the vacant space are buildings that were built in the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s and ’80s,” said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York tri-state region at real-estate brokerage CBRE.

And just as in the early ’90s, it is the overbuilt South that is hit hardest. Today, the three major U.S. cities with the country’s highest office-vacancy rates are Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas, according to Moody’s. In 1991, Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale in Florida and San Antonio held those positions.

Companies, eager to cut costs, also began ditching spacious private offices for open floors and cubicles, meaning they needed less space per employee.

“You had a shift away from the ‘Mad Men,’ Don Draper era of some of these large, large offices,” said Thomas LaSalvia, head of commercial real-estate economics at Moody’s Analytics.

That helped push up vacancies and started a gradual shift toward smaller offices that continues to this day. The Covid-19 pandemic merely sped up the shift as companies realized they needed even less space per employee because of remote work.

For all the similarities, there are also important differences between the two downturns. The crisis of the early 1990s ended abruptly after the economy started booming again. Vacancies plummeted, and companies gobbled up space. This time, most analysts expect offices to stay emptier for longer because vacancies have less to do with economic cycles and more to do with the growing popularity of working from home. 

Meanwhile, winners and losers have switched places. In 1991, San Francisco had the country’s third-lowest office-vacancy rate, according to Moody’s. Today, the city has some of the country’s emptiest offices, partly because its large tech sector has enthusiastically embraced remote work.

Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale had the highest vacancy rates among major U.S. markets in 1991. Today, they are among the lowest. Palm Beach’s vacancy rate fell from 28.8% in 1991 to 14.2% in 2023, the steepest drop among major markets. Fort Lauderdale saw the second-steepest drop during the period, from 28.1% to 18.9%.

West Palm Beach, Fla., had a “growth spurt” in the 1980s as developers plastered the city with giant office buildings, said Kevin Probel, a senior managing director at real-estate brokerage JLL. It took a long time to fill all that space.

Today, the area is once again in the middle of an office-construction boom. Developers are building high-end, hurricane-proof offices with landscaped outdoor terraces and pickleball courts. But unlike the 1980s, West Palm Beach is now a destination for major finance companies seeking low taxes and warm weather.",2024-01-08 22:24:54,2024-02-29 15:29:51.641599,51 days 17:04:57.641599,22,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191y0f6/offices_around_america_hit_a_new_vacancy_record/

Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading provider of space launch services and advanced satellite technology, today announced it has been selected by and is under contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and build 18 Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta Data Transport Satellites (T2TL - Beta).

Rocket Lab will act as prime contractor for the $515 million USD firm-fixed price agreement, leading the design, development, production, test, and operations of the satellites, including procurement and integration of the payload subsystems. The contract establishes Rocket Lab’s position as a leading satellite prime contractor, providing supply chain diversity to the Department of Defense (DoD) through vertical integration. The contract comprises $489 million base plus $26 million of incentives and options and will be carried out by Rocket Lab National Security (RLNS), the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary created to serve the unique needs of the U.S. defense and intelligence community and its allies.  
  
The SDA is procuring satellites in two-year ""tranches"" to build out a proliferated constellation in LEO to deliver needed space-based capabilities to the joint war fighter. The T2TL – Beta satellites, part of the Tranche 2 program, will be integrated into SDA’s Transport Layer to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to meet DoD needs.  
  
“This contract marks the beginning of Rocket Lab’s new era as a leading satellite prime. We’ve methodically executed on our strategy of developing and acquiring experienced teams, advanced technology, manufacturing facilities, and a robust spacecraft supply chain to make this possible. It’s exciting to now be delivering this capability for government and commercial customers alike,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “SDA’s acquisition approach favors speed, schedule certainty, and affordability to deliver next-generation space capabilities to the nation. We’ve proven Rocket Lab is capable of delivering this across our launch and spacecraft programs and we look forward to delivering it for SDA.”  
  
All 18 satellites will integrate subsystems and components built in-house by Rocket Lab, including solar panels, structures, star trackers, reaction wheels, radio, flight software, avionics, and launch dispenser. This high degree of vertical integration gives Rocket Lab a rare level of control over supply chain, enabling efficiencies and certainty on cost, schedule and quality. The satellites will be built at Rocket Lab’s advanced spacecraft development and manufacturing complex within the Company’s Long Beach headquarters. The facility includes a 12,000 sq. ft. cleanroom and 40,000 sq. ft. of streamlined production & test facilities designed to support constellation class manufacturing and satellite assembly, integration and test for commercial, civil and national security customers. The satellites are scheduled for launch in 2027.  
  
As a leading provider of advanced spacecraft and components, Rocket Lab has a backlog of more than 40 satellites in development and production. Rocket Lab satellite technology and components have been integrated into more than 1,700 satellite missions globally.",2024-01-08 21:27:55,2024-02-29 15:29:52.168882,51 days 18:01:57.168883,8,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191wkte/rocket_lab_makes_its_defense_prime_debut_with_05/

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and **are NOT predictions of stock price EOD**.

**BA, liquidity 8/10** – FAA grounds dozens of 737 Maxes. There have historically been problems with this plane, stock is down 6% as of writing. Back in 2019 it took over a year for this to fully resolve, so worth researching more into and looking into what made the stock move incrementally. 

**TNP/ZIM/FRO/Shipping Stocks, liquidity 8/10** – Shipping stocks that can move from any more Red Sea catalysts (don’t really expect anything more to move but still good to be cognizant of these). These HAVE made a decent move over the past week. 

**AMD (+5%), liquidity 10/10** – Reveals new “extreme” gaming chip, all chip stocks look green today regardless. (NVDA/SMH/SOXL).

**RIOT/MARA/BTC stocks- liquidity 8/10** – As always, still worth watching these for the ETF decision. The edge is in a rejection.

191osc6,stocks,JNJ to Acquire AMAM for $2B,"The first day of the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference brings news of JNJ's acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma for $2 billion at $28/share. AMAM is up 95%+ as folks chase the news; the deal is expected to close in the first half of the year.

It is super hard to pick the right companies that are potential acquisition targets that will see quick gains like AMAM is today, but maybe there are sources we can share to look into potential targets. This is a year of pent up acquisition demand to solve pipeline challenges before patent cliffs hit.

191byh0,stocks,"There’s a Shortage of Electrical Wires, Transformers. That’s Good for These Stocks.","https://www.barrons.com/articles/power-transformers-evs-grid-capacity-505cf143

Data centers, electric vehicles, and heat pumps are all creating more demand for electricity. The result is that the utility industry is having trouble getting the gear it needs to pump out the power.

Builders are running into shortages of transformers—those buzzing boxes at the top of power poles—and transmission wires.

“We’re…seeing extended lead times for transformers,” said David Schulz, CFO at electrical distributor Wesco at a conference in September. CEO John Engel said on the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call in November that the wait to get transformers was still longer than normal.

On Friday, the National Association of Home Builders announced plans to seek $1.2 billion in government funding to boost U.S. transformer production.

It isn’t just transformers that are needed. Power lines are hard to source, too. “Prysmian 
[lead time] is about 50 weeks plus,” said Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor. TS is a start-up making higher-tech transmission wires designed to carry more juice.

Prysmian is one of the dominant producers of cables globally. Its backlog of orders sits at about $11 billion, up from about $2.3 billion at the end of 2019.

Those data points are three canaries in the coal mine—so to speak—signaling that the U.S. isn’t quite ready to expand its electricity grid.

“You already have a tight supply situation,” added Huang, in an industry he said is poised to double its capital spending. The industry is “not even seeing that increase in your capex spending yet,” he said “This is just today’s environment.”

Overall, electricity demand growth is projected to accelerate, thanks to EVs and everything else that is going electric. The Energy Department sees electricity generation capacity expanding at a rate of about 2.6% a year over the coming 20 years, about double the rate since 1990.

Electric utilities in the U.S. have spent roughly $135 billion a year on average for the past few years to maintain and increase their capacity. That number should be near $170 billion in a couple of years, according to the Edison Electric Institute.

Growth is something the industry has to gear up for. Transformers are manufactured by the likes of Eaton and Hubbell, but most of the business is repair and replacement of existing infrastructure, explained RBC analyst Deane Dray. There hasn’t been a lot of investment for growth.

The good news is that will change. Companies such as Eaton and Prysmian can make good money as the grid grows.

Their numbers have already started to improve. Prysmian earnings have risen at about 57% a year for the past three years—between 2020 to 2023, including fourth-quarter estimates. Eaton has grown earnings at about 29% a year on average for that period.

For Prysmian, Wall Street expects earnings to rise at about 5% a year for the coming three years, according to FactSet. Analysts project 9% average annual earnings growth at Eaton over that time.

Wall Street sees earnings growth decelerating at both, but that doesn’t mean the peak is in. Analysts are loath to assume that good times will last forever, so they tend to forecast what they see as normal results.",2024-01-08 04:01:38,2024-02-29 15:29:52.168938,52 days 11:28:14.168939,7,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/191byh0/theres_a_shortage_of_electrical_wires/

190nwmk,stocks,What incentive does the market have to accurately value companies?,"Hi there, I'm very new to investing and I'm still trying to learn the fundamentals. So, this post could sound somewhat uninformed (because it is).

Now, Apple is worth $3T because of the price that its stock is trading at. That's the price that the people interested in buying Apple stock are willing to pay for it because they believe that's how much the company is worth. The same goes for every other asset like houses, gold, paintings, currencies etc. They're worth as much as people value them.

Now, when it comes to houses, I can understand why people value them; they can actually live in them and better houses provide for a greater standard of living. People have an incentive in buying houses other than the fact that their prices will go up. Gold also has aesthetic and scientific value. Paintings have aesthetic value. Currencies enable you to trade with countries that operate in them.

However, I don't fully understand why people value stocks and how buying stocks is different than buying worthless rocks.

What's the market's incentive in trying to get the market value of a company closely resemble its perceived value? Now, if dividends was the only motivation at buying stock - a better company generates higher profits in the long run and gives higher dividends - it would answer my question. However, most companies give very low dividends and high yield savings accounts are often a better choice here.",2024-01-07 08:47:36,2024-02-29 15:29:52.168977,53 days 06:42:16.168977,65,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/190nwmk/what_incentive_does_the_market_have_to_accurately/

As a result they can cut costs like crazy. The only checking is done by the state board of pharmacies, which is nowhere as stringent and hence as expensive as FDA.   
Also they basically only have generics so that means they don't really 'invent' anything going through Phase 1, Phase 2 etc. and most conditions don't really need any medical research. And earlier US companies used to do most of the cutting edge medical research, but now all the research has moved to Europe. Pfizer has Biontech in Germany, J&J has Janssen in Swiss, Sanofi is in France mostly, I guess Moderna is the only one still in US but might also move soon.

Plus they're online, so they don't need to maintain expensive equipment equipment like freezers or even deal with theft. They can also share liability with the shipping companies like UPS , Fedex incase of spoilage, so in case a patient sues them they can involve the shipping partners.

Also compared to physical pharmacies they don't have to call the cops or do any verification of patients before sending the drugs (not sure about this), so there are labor cost savings

I guess Rite Aid has already 'bit the dust', and now Walgreens is next.

1903hcj,stocks,Aren't Nelson Peltz/Trian and Ancora the most beloved and well-respected by/among shareholders/investors in Wall Street?,"So remember about how Disney will completely cease to exist by early this year?:

https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18zo7bu/disney_will_completely_cease_to_exist_early_this/

You see, Peltz has a history of completely hacking off General Electric until there was nothing left and Perlmutter has a history of saying this:

> If Disney's stock price keeps falling, Iger also has to worry about agitating more investors.
> 
> Iger is already tangling with ex-Marvel exec Ike Perlmutter, one of Disney's biggest individual shareholders, who has joined activist investor Peltz's fight to try to improve Disney's results by getting a bigger say over its strategy and operations.
> 
> **Perlmutter has told people he wants to break up Disney as much as he can and gain control of some of the IP, and ""people underestimate Ike at their peril,"" said a source familiar with Perlmutter's conversations.**
> 
> Disney's largely liberal stance on hot-button social issues could bring out other activist investors with political as well as financial motivations, like Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management, a big GOP donor. There are people who ""would love to take down the 'woke' company,"" the source added.

https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-iger-ceo-disney-return-insiders-anxious-losing-faith-2023-11

And at least according to some people, Disney is in much worse shape than General Electric ever was (like this guy - at least seemingly: 

> Actually it would be about fuckin time somebody gets that company sorted.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18zrbp1/as_ive_said_before_disney_will_completely_cease/kgkr9fw/) and the chance of Peltz/Trian/Ancora/Perlmutter/ taking over Disney and its board entirely is 100% because Nelson Peltz/Trian, Jay Rasulo, and Ancora the most beloved and well-respected by/among shareholders/investors in Wall Street while Iger is the most despised, are they not?

Also, given how anime is the biggest entertainment form in the world nowadays that are beloved by just about every kids and teenagers while Pixar/Disney is/are most despised, isn't it time to have them shut down entirely and have anime to take their places instead? I mean, for one, I've heard people saying that no one ever talks about Pixar or Disney anymore in positive manner while they always talk about anime.

18zyl4u,stocks,Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) DCF Analysis,"**NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

LYV is involved in a huge chunk of the ticketing portion for events such as concerts, clubs, and parties. They are either the direct promoters for these events or offering their ticketing platforms to other parties. LYV manages to wrest and maintain its control over other ticketing companies globally as LYV enters into multi-year contracts with venues or outright owns these venues. Such anti-competitive behavior has been the subject of much scrutiny from consumers, artists, and the government. This legal uncertainty of whether LYV may get broken up is the main focal point for every discussion around LYV's Valuation.

For my forecast, LYV management believes 2019 is the norm “2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results.” - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.

# Revenue:

Overall, for revenue I took into account “we didn't promote the Taylor tour, so I don't have that comparable to worry about in '24. Beyonce was our tour, wildly successful. But when we look at any artists across Ticketmaster, Live Nation, no artist is going to account for more than 1% of the tickets. So no one tour will ever hurt us year-over-year.” - 2023 Q3 Earnings conference.  
  
When forecasting the Number of Events, Number of Fans, and Fans/Events, I considered that Y/Y 2021 and 2022 results were accelerated due to the poor comparable year of 2020 and the post-covid recovery revenge spending. I assumed this triple-digit Y/Y growth did not continue and the accelerated growth only goes on for 2 years before LYV switches back to organic growth.   
  
When forecasting revenue/fans taking into account the high potential for legislation action if LYV raises their prices too much I assumed only meager growth till the end of my forecasted period.  
  
When forecasting the total number of tickets sold and revenue/ticket, I assumed that the total number of tickets sold recovered at a similar trajectory as the events held by LYV.   
  
When forecasting advertising revenue, as this area is a relatively new area being reported there isn’t much information to use for my forecast. Opting for less granularity I assumed that the Y/Y growth rate would be halved before being tapered off into perpetuity.

# Cost:

Overall, when forecasting cost I took into account “I expect margin expansion of least 50 basis points relative to last year, so making good progress, verging on halfway back towards the 2019 levels.” - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
  
When forecasting COGS, as COGS is a highly variable cost “These costs are primarily variable in nature.” - 2022 10-K. And given how COGS fluctuates very wildly with output as seen from FY20, I opted for less granularity and kept COGS as a % of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, as LiveNation ramps up for the first 3 years of my forecast the SG&A as a % of revenue declines before tapering downwards.  
  
When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I took Others as a % of historic averages.

# Change in NWC:

When forecasting Change in NWC, FY20 - FY21 is an inaccurate measure due to the restricted supply chain and covid restrictions. I took only the average for FY19 and FY22.

# WACC:

US has a bond rating of “AA+”  
AA+ Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 0.58%  
US 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.14%  
RFR = 3.56%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LYV/)) = 1.29  
4050 = (4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%) / (1+R) + \[((4050 \* 4.25%) \* (1+16%)) \* (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)\] / (1 + R) \^ 2   
R = 10.30%, ERP = 6.74%  
COE = 12.25%  
  
LVY has a bond rating of “BB-” ([SOURCE](https://cbonds.com/news/2363459/))  
BB- Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 2.33%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.65%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = 91.36  
Total shares outstanding = 231.59M  
Market Value of Equity = 21158.06M  
Given that only the 2022 10-K was released, assumed that 2023 debt was refinanced and lumped together with <1 Year.  
Weighted Average Maturity = 3 Years.  
2022 Interest Expense = 278.48M  
Market Value of Debt = 5959.31M  
%Debt = 21.98%  
%Equity = 78.02%  
%WACC = 10.58%

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case I value LYV at $72.84 per share. I believe that the large legal uncertainty looming over LYV makes it a risky stock. The stronghold LYV has over the ticketing industry is undeniable, however, this stronghold is a double-edged sword that could add more risk to the overall company.

18zwfkn,stocks,Alaska Airlines is grounding all Boeing 737-9 aircraft after a window blew out mid-air,"Things seems to be going pretty well when I bought BA end of 2017. 

Bounced from 290s to as high as 420. Then the Max groundings. It’s been issue after issue. This grounding is just one of a slew since 2019.
I wouldn’t be surprised if this extends to FAA and all 737-9s.

23 shares down 27% in my retirement account, I would have taken the loss if I could, but just bag holding as seems no point in this account, just sit it out till recovers. Yet i feel like I’m one grounding away from closing and just putting the money into SP.

18ztr47,stocks,How is Robinhood as a stock,"I know a lot of retail investors dislike Robinhood because of the whole GameStop, AMC meme stock thing, but keeping that aside (for a moment), it's a pretty decent product-
-Their charts aren't the best but they're okay, it's fluid, fast, intuitive and make sense to a huge genz population
-They have 24 hour trading on quite a few stocks
-The Robinhood gold actually gives you 5% interest rn or even more and also a lot of insights about a company (it set apples price target to 160$ almost 5-6months ago)
-The app is fun to use, and for someone new it's quite intuitive, the way they have the options UI makes sense to me 
-They also have a bunch of IRA stuff and stock lending (which I haven't explored)

Their equivalent in India called Zerodha is one of the biggest hits rn, so am surprised their American equivalent is so unrecognized.

This made me think it would be interesting to create some sort of Hate Index where we list the top most-hated stocks on Reddit (or on the internet in general), and then measure it against the S&P500 after a year or two. Or maybe it's been done already? Either way, it wouldn't shock me if the Hate Index turned out to outperform the market in the end.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

A problem I see is that the volume is very low, but it seems as if the company itself bids 10$ at every auction which could give high returns if you are the only one selling votes for a particular stock even if you don’t have a lot of shares but I haven’t used it yet so if anyone has used it I’d appreciate it if you could give some insight.",2024-01-05 09:55:07,2024-02-29 15:29:52.169093,55 days 05:34:45.169094,6,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18z3be0/has_anyone_used_shareholder_vote_exchange/
18z2rw8,stocks,What are your controversial stocks you’ll never own?,"I personally will never invest in oil and gas, tobacco or nestle because of their controversies.

 What are your stocks you’ll never invest in? I personally hate Nestle because of their child labour issues but what do you think?

Tobacco seems like an obvious choice for people killing themselves (oh but the dividend).

Please let me know!",2024-01-05 09:18:07,2024-02-29 15:29:52.169097,55 days 06:11:45.169097,529,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18z2rw8/what_are_your_controversial_stocks_youll_never_own/
