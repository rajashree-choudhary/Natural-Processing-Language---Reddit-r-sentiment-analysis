""Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""

“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.""

""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""

la3bft,investing,"Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved.","First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. 

I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. 

And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.

To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.

So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): 

>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.

>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1

>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)


>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.

>What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”



So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  

**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  
You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  

This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    

**Emotions**
The problem with this whole ""strike back at wall street"" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. 

Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.

TLDR: 

1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. 

2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.

3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  

Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole ""fight the hedge funds"" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.  In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong.

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).

# Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market.  I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday.  If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip.  Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making.  No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said!  Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always.  ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print.  Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164).  Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before.  Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action.  Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass.  There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL.  I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening.  Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case).  Outside the market, however...wow.

# You Thought Yesterday Was Fear?  THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you.  Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11.  What's even better?  Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit.  That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties.  Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites.  Other brokerages do the same.  Even for people on 0% margin.  Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note:  I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade.  You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week.  No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention.  And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you.  I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood.  Seriously WTF.  I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment.  Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action.  That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide.  But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures.  It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it.  Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around.  So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price).  This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well).  For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit.  So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000.  $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT.  Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange.  Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions.  If so... OUCH.  Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot.  And someone did.  If you're on the winning side, great.  It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side.  My recommendation: Just don't try it.  I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

**edit** *so while I was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot, /u/piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this: https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu

Ok, so I guess my in-the-moment mental math was off by about 10%. Man, that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade.*

Back to the market action..

# A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail.  All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok.  What did I see, you ask?  Why, the glorious  $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread.  WSB Reddit is down?  Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape.  I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move.  THIS is how I knew.  For sure.  It's in the market data itself.

**edit** *So, there's feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch.  Man, at least it was hilarious in the moment.  But also now I know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide.  Maybe a technical limitation of TOS*

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through.  I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on  I'm sure others tried the same thing.  Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing.  First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions).  More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000.  Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried.  Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear?  How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried.  They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack.  Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder.  You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape.  Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask?  Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

# The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly.  Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time.   I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

&#x200B;

|Date|Volume|Price at US Market Close|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Friday, 1/22/21|197,157,196|$65.01|
|Monday, 1/25/21|177,874,00|$76.79|
|Tuesday, 1/26/21|178,587,974|$147.98|
|Wednesday, 1/27/21|93,396,666|$347.51|
|Thursday, 1/28/21|58,815,805|$193.60|

What do I see?  I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks.  Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading.  Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday?  Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope.  It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out?  How is it that price being lower is bad for them?  Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly.  Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point.  The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably).  You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares.  It doesn't matter what those shares cost.  If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to?  Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price.  Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively.  They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster.  That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again.  Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting.  Much more thoughtful and informed.  Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible.  A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them.  And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

# Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this.  How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model.  This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing.  The model is not a real market.  There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too!  You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow.  But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented.  Remember?  That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero.  Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people?  They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment.  You guys know this.  It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short.  If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe?  I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade.  The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME.  Great.  Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market.  I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right?  I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered.  And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME.  In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything.  They just dug themselves right in there.  Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover?  They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower?  You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses.  Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price!  Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it.  So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared.  Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do?  They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on.  And then they need to hold on to them.  They can't be weak hands either.  They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter?  Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow.  They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts.  Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore.  You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly.  Only shares.  No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops?  Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday.  Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually.  You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+.  I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well.  Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out.  Maybe it works out, but maybe not.  There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember?  But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else.  In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?**  Do we get the infinity squeeze?  Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions.  I don't know.  No one does.  That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further.  Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

# The Market and the Economy.  Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend.  Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to.  I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months.  How can that be happening during a pandemic?  Because The Market is not The Economy.  The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for.  Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year.  We think.  We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway.  Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow.  That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do.  I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.  

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!).  Now I too get to dream the dream.  I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy.  Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle.  Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else.  At least I'm playing the same game.  Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times.  I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before.  This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right?  I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank.  I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades.  Wow... this actually might work.  I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade.  I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number.  Do I punch out now?  No?  Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks.  We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now.  Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby!  And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew.  At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off.  Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen.  We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears.  Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume.  We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair.  The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be.  This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in.  However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched.  GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose).  It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself.  Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME.  If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens.  I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point.  This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved.  Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation?  From GAMESTOP??  And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with??  We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation...  This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway.  Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

# A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back?  It's a scary question to have to face personally.  Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful).  Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control.  In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008.  Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too.  Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc.  Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons.  Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement.  I could actually, genuinely buy that.  I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart.  Scary smart.  Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do?  Do you take your losses and try again next time?  Hell no.

You're elite.  You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn?  Obvious double down.  Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here.  Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out.  F'in Elon Musk and his twitter!  You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow...  Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return.  You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right?  The masters of the universe!  Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple.  Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work?  You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too.  Ah well, that was a long shot anyway.  So where were you?  Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again.  Anyone even keeping track anymore?  Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic?  Man, that chart gives me goosebumps.  All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew.  Never though it'd come.  Where are you at now?... Over $9000^(\*)!!!  Wow.  You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

^(\*)*side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

The first reason I thought it worth sharing is because the teacher (Andrew Lo) is probably the best and most passionate finance professor I've ever seen. Really hooks you into the lectures. 

The second is that the course is filmed during the height of the subprime crisis, and each lecture starts with a discussion of recent events and how they relate to concepts in the course. Very interesting to hear perspectives and how they progress throughout the crisis.

It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.

l97jbo,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Market Mechanics,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).

I felt that Scott Wapner was pushing for him to admit  that GME is horribly mispriced, which it really is on  massive scale, but Chamath did not give him that, instead pushing the narrative that the hedge funds being 200% short the float is what is really wrong and the time has come where retail traders are leveling the playing field.

l8jwsl,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Technical Recap - 1/25 - 1/29," *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Wow, what a week.  All I'll say on that for now.  I'll maybe do a recap of Friday at some point this weekend if I can.

For this post, rather than a narrative recap, I'll go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim and Ortex.  I don't have a lot of time to go very deep into everything I normally do, but I wanted to give the newer traders an example of how I go about coming to some of my conclusions.

Some of the conclusions I came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data.  In my opinion, at least, it's very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time.  Please feel free to use the charts I'll show to challenge some of the assumptions I may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action, social media, and other high-frequency sentiment indicators (things I might rely on for a hyper-realtime momentum monster trade like GME has been this past week).  Maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well.

I realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me \~$300k in momentum trade opportunity LOL, since I used all of my free non-trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in-depth version of what I'm going to show you now.  That being said, if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on, and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors, that to me is well worth it--maybe one day you too can pay it forward!

# Fundamentals - Ortex Short Interest

First, lots of questions on the prior post about Short Interest remaining on GME so I'll start with this one.  Looks good to me.  I think Ortex will update end of trading Friday data just before/around Monday market open.  I consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data, as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze.  This is the type of data you'd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded.  Note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a 'fundamental ' attribute, and normally I'd agree, but I think GME and maybe some of the other high SI plays are an exception to that.

If any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart, make sure to look at the axis values on the left.  The chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period, so the bottom of the axes are not 0.

A few things to note:

1. Short interest drops substantially from 1/26 into 1/27
2. Volume is shrinking
3. Remaining free float on loan has gone down, but at 66% as of Thursday, is still quite high

# Overview - Daily Chart & Summary of the Week

A few things going on here

1. The big volume days on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred.  The battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra-day charts.
2. Big picture here, what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below $148 on huge volume.  That means the core of your retail support, and the majority of shares in WSB diamond hands would have been bought probably between the $30 and $148 price range.  My guess is that Only DFV the DFV early acolytes, Dr. Burry, and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below $30.
3. Given points 1 and 2, I'd consider the $148 price level as the critical defense level of your earliest, hardest retail support.  You can dive deeper into the 1/26 trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well, but I'll roll with that for now.
4. Ok, so maybe the Melvin guys weren't really lying.  The Ortex data showing short interest drop from 1/26 to 1/27 coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on 1/27.
5. If new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs, possibly selling into the forced buying of what I'll just assume was the overnight Melvin squeeze and into the early market  hours on 1/28.  Possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the Robin Hood BS, the bots, and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that HFT ladder attack on the vertical dive.  Wow--no wonder that thing was so intense.
6. As you can see on that downside wick on 1/28, the huge momentum briefly pierced the Retail line before being slammed back up.  We'll take a closer look in the fibonacci chart.

# Analysis - Mini Squeeze Hourly

Just a few notes. I checked and the after hours volume here was sudden, quite unusual, and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position.  Rather than slamming it all out at once, the broker spread it out quite a bit.  Some takeaways:

1. If you wanted to take money from Melvin, this was the chance, and a lot of people (or a few whales) certainly did.  The numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading
2. The price didn't break away as aggressively as it probably could have, which means there was some carefully calibrated pre-planning to unload a bunch of shares, laddering up to the $350 level.
3. I am genuinely sorry to have to conclude, therefore, that the WSB bros with the $420.00 limit got scooped. Something on the order of 17 million shares worth of Melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a HFT whale with access to firehose shares at Melvin's broker all the way through overnight trading.  few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window, and certainly not on the order of 17 million shares anyway.
4. Another important takeaway: 17 million shares is a lot, but it's nowhere near the entire original SI in GME.  The Game hasn't necessarily Stopped yet (heh).

# Technical Analysis - 1/28 to 1/29 Fibonacci Retracement

For those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call ""technical analysis"", it's really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines, bars, etc. on charts to try to figure out what's going on.

One particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement.  It sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it is extremely useful, and extremely commonly used by momentum traders (which is partly why it's useful--if everyone is trading off of the same thing, it's a self-reinforcing bias in the market).  There is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic--I recommend it.  You'll be a better trader and even investor for it, as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts.  Kind of uncanny really.

Looking at this chart I realize I probably should have plotted the 'retail line of defense' here too.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Takeaways:

1. I figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume.  That happened to be the top to bottom move on the Robin Hood news.
2. Using that for the fibonacci retracement, you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the 50% - 61.8% channel in after hours trading.
3. it's quite possible that short-term equilibrium on this battleground stock is $300 to $350 until either side makes a strong push.  Price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume.
4. Probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement (or something very similar) for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense.  In all honesty it's hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook, making it self-reinforcing.  All that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it.
5. Below the price graph, pay attention to the volume bars below.  It's especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price, as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship.  For example, when price is moving around a lot, is it doing so on high volume or not much volume?
6. Traders tend to overshoot a little on each push, so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike, if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push, that actually tells you that it's likely to go higher a little later on.  There are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing (patterns, volume and price analysis, etc.), and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live.

Lots more going on here, but this post is getting pretty long already.

# Other Takeaways

* The whales in the pond obviously do their homework (that's how they got to be that big, after all), and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload 17 million shares at the upper end of the trading range when Melvin got blown up.  That's how you make big bank on big volume--do your homework.
* My thesis in the [part 2 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l6xc8l/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_2/) that the big early drop before retail pre-market was a short-side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong.  You could make a case either way that it was a new short-side player diving in at a higher price point, a  long-side whale making bank, or a combo of both.  if you check the Ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate.  If so, apologies to the CNBC Squawk Box crew--probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting (though the tone did make a lot of retail panic)
* Ironically, it might very well have been the continued unwinding of Melvin's short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long-side heavy hitter.  LOL.
* Thursday afternoon and Friday were low volume, low-conviction momentum sloshing around.  Dueling HFT algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess.
* Contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week, so I'm not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful.
* I'm sure if I go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully I'll find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts.  It's key when trading, at least in my opinion, that you are willing, able, and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions, no matter how much you liked them. Challenge and verify with data whenever possible.  Not doing that is how Melvin got blown up, after all.
* My worst case scenario thesis in the [part 3 article](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into GME at these newer highs.  I remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting GME at the $400 as a stabilization mechanism.  Wow.. short something with the most hyper volatility of any $1bn+ stock I've ever heard of... for stability.  That's not a word I'd ever associate with a WSB meme momentum rollercoaster stock.
* An infinity squeeze is still totally on the table, as long as sufficient short interest remains.  The strategy and tactics you'd use to get there may have to be different though, as price ratchets up into higher bands. I'll keep those thoughts to myself--for sure those WSB guys have a plan.  They've proven to be scary effective so far after all.

There are other things you can take away, or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to.  Hopefully, for you newer traders I've given you a useful glimpse into how I might try to use readily available data to improve/challenge/refine a working thesis to ensure I'm better prepared for the days ahead.  You should find the tools that seem to work best for you.

lh2by7,investing,I am no longer picking stocks. It's ETFs for me.,"I've been investing for a couple years. Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.

About a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I've noticed a surprising trend:

My ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.

I guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.

lt7oop,investing,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

l5l413,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

There are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.

There has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.

Short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.

Short sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.

That being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.

GME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).

There is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.

Previous short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.

In order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).

So what is happening now, and where do we go from here?

Right now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.

Even as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.

GME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.

At this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.

ldrsgq,investing,"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","
[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).

Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. 

“St0nks” were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). 

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. 

Everybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).

Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

The ""dip"" came. Eli figured ""st0nks only go up"" - I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).

Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.



So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.


1. I  usually don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. The riskier the stock the earlier and more I scale back.

Compound that interest, bitch.

2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That’s money. Money pays bills, capital grows.

3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit in riskier playa. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. 

So let’s say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. 

Obviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer, but for me it’s a lot about maintaining that cash position.


So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. 


1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They’re now up 15%. 

Compound that interest, bitch.


2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. 


3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. 



Moral of the story or TLDR;

Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. 

Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.

Disclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it’s inspiration.

PS Eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies. I believe one of them is going to IPO soon DS

lujnvo,investing,S&P 500 since 1950 - graph showing all crashes,"[S&P 500 Since 1950 - 7 crashes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v3WOgbWL/)


Hi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement. 

I've summarised a list all stock market crashes since 1950. There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. 

The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.

The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.

The S&P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). 

I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a 'fear of overvaluation' was only the dotcom crash where the PE's were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.

I'm not saying a crash / correction won't happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. 

By no means am i an economist but I didn't include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.

Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.

No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let's say) you'll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it's more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of > 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There's roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.

Edit: Changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake.

Edit: Further Log Graph explanation (why log is preferred) If the scale has a large range (i.e. 100 to 3000) then log should be used because its important to show the % changes as opposed to the point changes. A 1 point increase in the SP500 now is only 1/3811 = 0.02% whereas a 1 point increase 10 years ago was 1/1000= 0.1%. It's important to look at it in terms of % change because companies grow in terms of % as well. For example you don't quote apple has grown its business by 30 billion this year ( random number), instead you say apple grew its sales by 20% this year. Its so that its comparable.",2021-02-28 16:15:43,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319552,1092 days 06:17:06.319553,910,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/
l3z5jq,investing,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.

A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration’s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.

The president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump’s order while it crafted its new policy framework.

The move is part of Biden’s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world’s two most powerful countries.

Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.

Senior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating “repression or serious human rights abuses”.

“We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,” a second senior administration official said.

Investors would have time to “unwind” investments, a third official said.

The new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.

But some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.

In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China’s military.",2021-06-04 04:08:46,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319563,996 days 18:24:03.319563,268,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nrw7cv/biden_bans_us_investment_in_chinese_military_and/

This article is short and doesn't elaborate much on what the effects of giving public access to supply and demand data are. Sueing the SEC seems like another way to stifle access to information for retail investors disguised as a means to protect them.

I have a lot of bias right now against institutional entities and I'm interested in what people have to say about this and whether or not this is more sensational news for clicks.

lcftzc,investing,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

lqfhuz,investing,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.",2021-02-23 10:42:56,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319585,1097 days 11:49:53.319585,1593,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/

n6dh3d,investing,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner.

ihlam2,investing,"I graphed whether Reddit panics before the stock market does, or vice versa","So I did some quantitative sentiment analysis to see if News websites/Reddit/Twitter panics before the stock market does, or if the stock market panics before Reddit/Twitter does.

I have written an algo determining (stock specific) sentiment, I ran this on a dataset with (financial) news headlines (about 900k headlines), Twitter headlines en (stock related) Reddit headlines. From that I compared sentiment to the SP500 and I compared the intensity and volume of negative headlines to the VIX. This resulted in the two plots shown.

Since the plot is somewhat full, I made it interactive so one can show for example only Reddit sentiment and zoom in and out of datapoints. This is in html, but Im not sure whether its allowed to share the link here so in case one is interested to play around with it shoot me a pm.

lasgrh,investing,"Gamestop Big Picture: Theory, Strategy, Reality","*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

Apologies for the lengthy post again.  Good luck in the market!",2021-02-02 10:11:57,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319620,1118 days 12:20:52.319620,1213,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lasgrh/gamestop_big_picture_theory_strategy_reality/

9o9w1u,investing,Sears files for bankruptcy,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

Its key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

Now, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html).

lm2mry,investing,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.”

“We’re holding a lot more cash than we’ve held historically,” he said. “It’s because duration doesn’t work, interest rates don’t work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn’t espouse a certain allocation or target holding.”",2021-02-17 19:34:47,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319710,1103 days 02:58:02.319710,1459,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/

t8taem,investing,Biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports.

The White House is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation banning Russian imports, a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline, a source told Reuters

**A senior U.S. official told Reuters that no final decision has been made but ""it is likely just the U.S if it happens”**

Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the United States and European allies consider banning Russian imports.

Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products. read more The United States relies far less on Russian crude and products, but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch U.S. consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump. read more

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Sunday letter that her chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbor.

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched.

So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.

Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said.

At the same time, the White House did not deny that Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. Axios reported that such a trip was a possibility.

""This is premature speculation and no trip is planned,"" a White House official said.

A year ago Biden shifted U.S. policy away from a focus on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman.

fp4vxy,investing,My experience of the 2008 bailout,"I wanted to share my experience of the 2008 bailouts because we are among friends. Right? And friends help each others, and share their experiences. Right?


During the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.


It was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?


Then came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it. A lot of back and forth for days for politicians to get a chance to pass it. (They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).


Finally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. ""About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.""


I remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?


Well, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.


As the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.


After we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.


Well, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.
This time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.


So today:

- People were losing their jobs. Check.

- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.

- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.

- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.


I am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.
Unlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?


Unlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?
As we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.
Hopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.
Hospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).
Esp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!
And even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.
Expect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.


I understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.


From my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.
This time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.


And most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.
My sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.
Hang in there!

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

lmk8f3,investing,Due Diligence of Bitcoin Mining stock valuations: RIOT and MARA,"# Due Diligence of Bitcoin Mining stock valuations: RIOT and MARA

Unlike the 2017/18 rise of Bitcoin, the 2020/21 Bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand.

With institutional demand comes institutional products. We have seen bitcoin derivatives, bitcoin trusts, and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action: publicly traded bitcoin mining companies.

There are two bitcoin mining companies which I'd like to review for you here. Both trade on Nasdaq; they are [**RIOT**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-RIOT/) and [**MARA**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/).

Lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining.

---

## **What is Bitcoin Mining?**

To mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). The cryptographic combination of the nonce + next block content must be numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target (more on this below). Generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive. There is no shortcut, miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. They are trying to find the answer to a math problem; a nonce that hashes correctly with the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) (cryptographical hashing function).

The bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. This is called the [difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty). The aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes. This means that if the mining power is doubled, the difficulty is made 2x harder. Double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin.

We can see an estimate for the [total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate).  Notice that it is about 150m TH/s right now (150 million trillion nonces tried every second). So for every block (every 10 minutes) 9*10^22 attempts are done (90 sextillion) until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can ""mine"" the next bitcoin block. In doing so they get rewarded 6.25 newly generated bitcoin + some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network.

You can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block. In fact, this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done. However, these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin. This is because people have developed special ASIC chips designed specially for brute forcing the SHA-256 function. These chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer.

## **Mining on an ASIC Bitcoin Miner**

The biggest producer of ASIC Bitcoin Miners is a Chinese company called [Bitmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmain). They produce miners, run many of the miners, and even run many [mining pools](https://antpool.com/) where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits.

Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin. This is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit.

So lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an ASIC miner today.

The [Antminer S19 Pro](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) is one of Bitmain's latest machines.  It can run an impressive 110 TH/s and uses 3250W of power. On their website Bitmain is listing them at $3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as $2333 (notice they are sold out until at least August).

So:

* **$2333 machine cost**
* Using $0.08/kWh electricity costs ([benchmark for electricity cost in China](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html)) we get 3.25kW * $0.08 = $0.26 per hour in electricity costs. Assuming we run 24/7 this gives us $0.26 * 24 * 365 = **$2278 in electricity costs per year**
* And how many bitcoin will we mine? Well at 110 Th/s on an ASIC machine we are capturing 110/150,000,000 = 0.0000733% of the total bitcoin network per machine **at current total hash rate**. 52,560 bitcoin blocks mined per year; 6.25 bitcoin reward per block + ~1.25 bitcoin in transaction fees (avg right now) -> 7.5 bitcoin per block * 52,560 blocks -> 394.2k bitcoin per year for the entire network. 0.0000733% of this is **0.289 bitcoin per machine per year = $14,450 revenue (at $50k per bitcoin)**
* **$14,450 - $2278 = $12.2k profit per year**

You can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels. For example, **if the total hash rate doubled to 300m Th/s, profit per machine would drop to $5k per year.**

Also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin (sending and receiving transactions). See [historic transaction fees](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees). 

And how long can you run a machine for?

Running so many calculations slows a machine quickly. Additionally, new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly. **As a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years.** This is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet.

In Year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially.

There have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through IP address analysis of miners working in pools. The University of Cambridge has a [real-time map](https://cbeci.org/mining_map) in which we can see that in 2020 mining was:

| Country    	| % Total Hash Rate 	|
|------------	|-------------------	|
| China      	| 69%               	|
| Russia     	| 6%                	|
| US         	| 5%                	|
| Kazakhstan 	| 5%                	|
| Malaysia   	| 4%                	|
| Iran       	| 4%                	|

## **RIOT and MARA**

Now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works let's look our new investment phenomenon: publicly traded NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining companies.

## **RIOT**

Incorporated in July 2000, the company was renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017. The company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with Coinmint LLC in New York who operate the miners. RIOT was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020.

How many miners do they have?

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [11.5k miners in operation and 10k more to be delivered](https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Oct 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000871/riot_s3.htm))
* In December 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin ($3->$15 in 1.5 months). They took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering [raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). With this money [they ordered 15k more miners for $35m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001096/ex99x1.htm). Expected delivery starts in May 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in October 2021.

**Summary: 37,640 machines at full deployment. 11.5k machines today and won't be running the rest until Q3/Q4.**

So ignoring the cost of the machines:

* Operational 11.5k machines at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $137m
* Full capacity (Q3/Q4) 37.6k machine at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $459m

And assets

* Maybe $150m in cash/btc left over from secondary offering and past assets


Note: They may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as $0.014 per kwh in some releases.


## **MARA**

Incorporated in 2010, the company has a wild history. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium, then real estate in Southern California, and most recently patent trolling. The company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence. In 2019 (I think?) the company began delving into bitcoin mining.

In September 2019 they purchased 6k S9 Bitmain miners (13.5 TH/s) for $4m. Notice that at 13.5 TH/s: these machines are far from profitable today (I'm not even sure they were profitable back then!).

So more recently they own:

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [6.5k miners in operation and 30k more to be delivered](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Aug 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220014870/forms-3.htm))
* In December 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from $2->$14 in a month. [They raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm). With this money they ordered 70k more miners (delivery of 7k in July, 63k in December) for $168m
* In January 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising [$300m more](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000864/forms-3asr.htm). They used $150m of this to buy 4.8k bitcoin at $31k per coin

**Summary**

* **Operational 6.5k miners = $79m per yr**
* **Full capacity (Dec 2021) 103k miners = $1.25bn per yr!**

**They also made ~$90m on their bitcoin holdings so far ($150m -> ~$240m)**

Impressive numbers right? Well..

---

## **Too good to be true?**

So what are RIOT and MARA trading at you may ask?

With the recent jump of bitcoin to $50k, RIOT and MARA have rocketed.

* RIOT closed at $77.90 per share, **a market cap of $5.3bn**
* MARA closed at $47.90 per share, **a market cap of $4.5bn**

Investor euphoria is at all time highs. So much so that their price action has rapidly [outpaced](https://i.imgur.com/VjQTaA3.png) and [diverged](https://i.imgur.com/wwzoTn6.png) from bitcoin.

So is it because they have such huge potential? If RIOT gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making $459m per year? And MARA $1.25bn per year!?!

Well, probably not..

* As bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware. From Oct to Dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from $4k to $20k. Total hash rate went up about 60% during this time. [However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) with a lag.
* As the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money.
* Both RIOT and MARA are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and won't be taking delivery until late 2021/early 2022. What will the network's total hash rate be by then? What will bitcoin price be by then? Chinese miners won't be sitting by idle.
* And we ignored the cost of the machines! In the future RIOT and MARA will need to buy new machines. Regardless of the market the old ASIC miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability. Bitcoin is closed system; There will only be a maximum of 328.5k + tx fees of bitcoin mined per year. In fact, this will reduce in 2024 with the next ""halving"". A company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin/capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same. How many $100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch?
* Take a look at the [past financials of these companies](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000948/riot10qq3-0920.htm). RIOT mined an ""impressive"" $2.4m worth of bitcoin in Q3 2020. Their costs were $1.3m in electricity/rent/etc. + $1.2m depreciation ($2.5m!). Once you add in their $2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of -$2.1m for the quarter. Their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool $385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at -$1.7m.
* Of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins Q4 2020 price action. But this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions.


The bull case:

* Bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back. The total hash rate doesn't catch up and $50k btc becomes $1m btc. MARA's $1.25bn revenue next year becomes $12.5bn before ASIC miner production catches up. Investors doubled their money.


Of course, if it becomes so profitable one wonders if Bitmain decides it is better value to use the miner's themselves and breach their contract.

## **Tobin's Q**

Simply stated, when you invest in a RIOT or MARA you are investing in the profitability/unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 1-2 years.

It could be hugely profitable, or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns.

In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

So perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these NASDAQ companies is the [Q Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q). The Q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets.

RIOT

* Market Cap $5.3bn
* Current btc miners 11.5k ($27m)
* Ordered btc miners 26k ($60m)
* $150m cash remaining (guess)
* **A whopping Q ratio of 22.4! And 63% of that is cash, 25% in orders!**

MARA

* Market Cap $4.5bn
* Current btc miners 6.5k ($15m)
* Ordered btc miners 96.5k ($225m)
* $240m in bitcoin
* $100m cash remaining (guess)
* **A ""value"" Q ratio of 7.75!**

With this approach, RIOT is trading at a 22.4x premium today and MARA a 7.75x.

A criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged. Just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and won't have most of their machines online until 2022. Is it really worth such a premium?

---

## **Other factors to consider**

These companies have questionable management. **The CEO of MARA has awarded himself [compensation in excess of $300m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000469/form8-k.htm) over the last few months. Realise that the market cap of MARA was less than $300m just 3 months ago.**

Both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices. MARA has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from $20->$48 in the time RIOT has gone from $20->$77.

A read through both of their 10-Qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims, shareholder class actions, and past investment write-offs due to corruption/shady circumstances.

These companies have no moat. They have no IP. They have no key talent hires. They are simply ordering ASIC miners, plugging them in, and having the biggest pay-days of their lives.

## **Trading strategies**

So is there a trading strategy I would recommend?

### **Bear**

**The challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk/reward is there for betting on the downside.**

Right now the market doesn't care for your fundamentals. Bitcoin has passed $50k, the narrative is that its going to $100k. The market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month.

It sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening. It is far too dangerous to be short these stocks. Or worse, short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intra-day move.

So that leaves you with puts. Average implied vol nearing 300% does not make them cheap.

If you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads.

Longer DTE plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target.

Another interesting idea would be a relative trade. If you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at <20x premium your long run earnings could net out. However, all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so you'd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some ASIC miners yourself.

More simply you could go long bitcoin and short RIOT/MARA. This should converge in the long run. The risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings.


### **Bull**

Buy as far OTM weekly calls as you can at 400% IV and hope that momentum market continues. Fundamentals are for the 2010s.

---

### **Other**

Both RIOT and MARA's stock price spent some time consolidating down from ~28 to the 16-22 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial $45k run up back to to $30k.

It is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback. However, the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being.

Ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum/hype/technical and probably retail driven. Long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser. But be careful; that doesn't seem to matter right now.

**TLDR; Bitcoin mining stock valuations are about as crazy as the valuations of all growth stocks in this market.

kjgtuc,investing,Reminder: BABA stock does NOT entitle shareholders to equity in Alibaba,"Been seeing a lot of users posting DD on Alibaba and making a bullish case for it. Seems like the massive drop in share price now should be a fantastic opportunity to pick up the Amazon of China at only a forward P/E of 18 right? Not exactly.

This has been posted before in less detail, but I think it's important to remind investors of the current circumstances arising during the anti-trust probe with China.

The reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn't even have ownership of Alibaba's equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.

Chinese law forbids foreigners from owning strategic assets in the country, and Alibaba wouldn’t be able to keep its licenses if, say, a U.S. hedge fund directly bought into the company.  Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba's Chinese assets but will not actually own them. This structure is called a VIE.

So think about this, if Chinese laws prohibit foreigners from owning/investing in these kinds of assets in China, what would protect the shell company in the Caymans from enforcing their contract to receive profits from Alibaba if shit hit the fan with the CCP? If Alibaba gets broken up during anti-trust probes, how do we know which subsidiaries BABA ( the shell company in the caymans) will be contractually obligated to receive profits from? Heck, is this contract to receive profits even enforceable in China, where the law clearly states foreigners can't own strategic investments?

Is this VIE structure even legal in China? Beijing has never acknowledged the legality. According to Harris Bricken, an international law firm:

"" VIEs are illegal. We disagree with those who are saying that what is proposed is a two tier, foreign/Chinese system. ""

We don't know the true answers to the above questions. BABA could easily be worth 0$ if investors one day decide that the ""contract"" to receive profits from Alibaba is basically BS.

Alibaba and Chinese executives come out a winner either way. Alibaba was able to raise billions from foreign investors without giving up a single bit of ownership.

Oh, by the way, all Chinese listed companies on US exchanges are listed as Cayman shell companies, this isn't specific to Alibaba. Baidu and JD are set up the same way.

EDITS:

1. Since many of you are asking, yes NIO is also set up this way. When I said all Chinese companies are listed this way, I literally mean 100%.
2. I don't know why so many high-profile investors still buy these ADR's. My favourite value investor, Bill Miller, also holds a huge position in BABA. I guess you're either in the camp that believes China won't enforce their own laws on foreign ownership so BABA's VIE is undervalued, or that one day they will and so the intrinsic value of BABA's VIE is 0$ because profits can never legally flow to foreign investors.
3. The SEC just last month in a report published in November expressed serious concerns: ""These China-based Issuer VIE structures pose risks to U.S. investors that are not present in other organizational structures. For example, exerting control through contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct equity ownership, and a company may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements, including those relating to the distribution of funds among the entities. Further, the Chinese government could determine that the agreements establishing the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could subject a China-based Issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interests. "" Source: [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers)
4. After some further research, Mainland Chinese companies listed on the HKE are also VIE's and considered ""offshore"".

But most people in states that it is not legal in will get to enjoy edibles that were previously unavailable to them. Also edibles are easy to scale up the manufacturer and distribution of.

2. Cresco is an American company. I think believe that the Canadian companies don't have as much potential for growth as American ones do. Just my opinion.

3. Cresco is the nation's largest wholesale distributor. This will be huge when every Tom, Dick and Joe starts opening cannabis shops like starbucks.

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.",2021-03-25 04:19:11,2024-02-25 22:32:49.319794,1067 days 18:13:38.319795,340,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/

fhdt30,investing,"Warren Buffett, as always, looks like the smartest guy in the room.","If you've paid any attention to the financial news over the last 2 years, you've seen the questions and critiques about Warren Buffett's cash position. In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. 

Take this article by CNBC from November of last year:

*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett’s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*

*“He pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can’t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that’s alright,” said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*

*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett’s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.""*

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html

I can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. 

As stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.

TLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline.

lih6ee,investing,Full Diligence Post on Palantir (PLTR) - Earnings Next Monday (2/16) & Lockup Expiration (2/19),"Hello! Wanted to share my thoughts on Palantir ahead of its earnings next TUESDAY (Edit: sorry I got the day wrong in the title but the date 2/16 is correct). Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn’t realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

Take a look at this account's [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/) and you'll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like /r/aww, /r/nextfuckinglevel, /r/MadeMeSmile, /r/funny, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.

Take a look at the post content and you'll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free 'analysis' about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of 'pitch' paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.

I've been noticing this happening in /r/investing and /r/stocks over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about 'mining', 'copper', 'gold', and other such keywords.

This is just quickly scanning over posts in these two subreddits over the past month - it's been going on longer than that and I'm guessing is probably in other investing-related subreddits as well that I just don't see.

ngamt2,investing,Can we please throw out the idea that Bitcoin is an asset that protects against inflation?,"Throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin, I've heard this statement over and over again. ""Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century""... ""Bitcoin is protection against jpow's printer"".... ""Bitcoin prevents against USD debasement""...

I have nothing against blockchain tech on its own. I think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology. With that said, the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid. And given today's selloff, it's a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality.

**Bitcoin As Inflation Protection = Bad Narrative**

I have said for a long time that bitcoin is a RISK ASSET. It's yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation. In this light, it's not that different from the growth investing asset class.

If bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection, then why in the world did it tank 12% on the day that we got the highest YOY CPI print in over a decade? And nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising... since they haven't risen in any significant way since that inflation print. And it's now tanked almost 40% at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class. Something... doesn't add up here.

Why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something, when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that aren't dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and ""money printing""? And for whatever it's worth, Gold suffers from some of the same problems, although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto.

**Bad Economic Narratives Dominate Bitcoin Beliefs**

* How many times do people need to show you M2 charts before they actually take a minute and compare M2 to the actual inflation levels? Hint for those who aren't aware, growth in M2 is 100% meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money.
* How many times do people need to call quantitative easing ""money printing"", without understanding how quantitative easing actually works? Hint: the ""money printing"" comes from temporary fiscal stimulus, not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks' balance sheets.
* How many times do people misunderstand that ""asset inflation"" (which is just another word for a bubble) is different than consumer price inflation? Hint: Real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets (such as bitcoin).
* How many times do people need to suggest the US dollar is ""getting killed"" before they actually look at a price history chart of the US Dollar? Hint: the US dollar is more or less right in the middle of it's price range over the last 50+ years, is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from 2005-2015, and hasn't even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus + fed swap lines used since the Covid pandemic. You would think that if the US dollar was ***actually*** debasing, we would get more than a 5% drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever. 

&#x200B;

My personal subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets. This IS actually in part a product of quantitative easing, but the irony here is that QE is not actually causing inflation. I think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses, but I have no clue whether Bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership. Note: I do not own any crypto or crypto-oriented stocks, so I don't have anything to either gain or lose here.

And by the way, this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin.

I wanted to chat a bit about options here. I realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online, but many are either overly complex, oversimplified, trying to sell you some products, etc. I figured I would explain some of it here, in order to reduce the learning barrier. After all, knowledge is power. And given the **recent** [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss) **with Robinhood**, I figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood, and don’t end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later. If you are interested in trading options, I invite you to look for more details online.

I have been trading options since 2008. I made some mistakes, so many, especially in the beginning. Over the years, I kinda reduced my option trading activities, but these past few months, I have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile, which helps with my trading style.

This **first** post is to explain how options work in general, the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will go into some more details, the third posts [3a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/) and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/) will explain some standard strategies, and the fourth posts ([4a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/) and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how I approach option investing. If you are looking at r/wsb style of investment, please skip these posts, they are not for you. I am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles, but I will still take some calculated risks. So I say. :) It is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard ETFs / mutual funds / Real Estate. So, my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth.

It is often perceived that options are extremely risky, and one of the best ways to get ruined. For some trades, this can be true. To dispel a myth, in reality, options can also be used to be extremely conservative. Even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market. Unlike for shares, where you can only control the diversification, with options you have a much bigger control on the risk / profit profile. Time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit (or lose) from.

One thing to note is that not all companies or ETFs provide options for their shares.

**The basics: CALL and PUT contracts, strike, and exercise**

Options are split into two groups: CALLs and PUTs. Both have a strike, an expiration date, and a number of shares attached to it. We’ll talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later. When you buy a call or put option, you buy a contract with a 3rd party through your broker and the stock market. Usually, one contract represents 100 shares.

The strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument. So for SPY that is worth $308 today, you will have options with strike $308, but also $300, $301, $310, etc… From $5 to $525. Options strikes are created as the underlying instrument SPY goes up and down. For SPY, strikes have a granularity of $1 around the share price, but can also be $5 or even $10 farther from the current price. Some other instruments have a $2.5, $5 or even $10 granularity. It can even have a $0.50 granularity. (Hello Hertz! It dropped so much that the lowest strike is $0.50 right now).

A CALL is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you buy a call with a $150 strike, and the share price went up to reach $200, this allows you to buy some shares at $150 that are now worth $200. The action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call. When you exercise your call contract, you are buying shares into your account.

Remember that, in most cases, 1 contract will buy 100 shares in your account. When exercising each call contract, you will need $15k of cash in your account in this example ($150 for the strike, multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $20k (at $200 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the call option (more on this later), this means you will make a profit of $5k if you sell the shares.

Conversely, a PUT is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you bought a put with a $200 strike, and the share price went down to $150, this allows you to sell some shares at $200 that are now worth $150 each. Similarly to a call, the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put.

When exercising each put contract, you are selling 100 shares from your account. When exercising each contract, your 100 shares will be sold for $20k ($200 for the strike multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $15k (at $150 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the put option, this means you made a profit of $5k. If you did not have the 100 shares per contract in your account, you would be actually short selling the shares, and you could make the $5k profit by buying these shares back.

In summary, a call buys shares when exercising. A put sells shares when exercising. Most importantly, in the vast majority of the cases, you should actually not exercise your contracts, but instead, you should sell your call or put at the market price, as you will increase your profit (see extrinsic value later).

Brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money. In other words, you can’t exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call (you want to buy low when the value is high), or current value is above the strike for a put (you want to sell high when the value is low).

Most brokers do auto-exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised. If the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date, and you did not sell your contracts before, they will be worthless, and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost.

Although I am mostly talking about American style options that can be exercised at any time, there are also European style options that can only be exercised at expiration. In the US markets, pretty much all stocks and ETFs are American style, But the cash-settled indexes, like SPX and RUT, are European style.

**The basics: Intrinsic and extrinsic value**

A call or a put contract costs money to buy, called a premium, so a 3rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put. After all, they won’t take the other side of this contract for free, and they have to be remunerated. The minimum for a contract is $0.01 per share for some very liquid ETFs, but for most instruments, it is $0.05, thus $5 per contract for 100 shares. When you buy a call or put, this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date. The 3rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses (see below).

The value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike, on the share price going up and down, the share’s volatility (how fast / far it goes up or down), and the time passing.

When you buy a contract, the strike and the expiration date is known. However, the share price and volatility will constantly change. All the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing (closer to the expiration date).

The intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price. It is above $0 only when you can exercise the contract. The extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time. For pretty much all options, this extrinsic value is above $0, and will slowly drop to $0 as we get closer to the expiration.

Let’s take an example with a share price of $150.

Say, you buy a call with a strike of $145 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($150 - $145), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5). Said differently, if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date, your call contract would bring you $5 per share. You would have lost $2 due to the time passing.

Similarly, you buy a put with a strike of $155 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($155 - $150), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5).

It is worth noting that any call with a strike price at $150 or above has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $155 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. If the stock price does not go over $155, you will lose the full $4 per share (so a $400 loss per contract). Similarly, a put with a strike price at $150 or below has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $145 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. Your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under $145.

Note that, in these examples, I use the same price for the call and put options that are $5 away from the strike price, but it’s not always the case. The call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility, market expectations, potential dividends, cost of money, etc.

**The basics: ATM, ITM, and OTM**

There are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls.

An option is ‘At The Money’ (ATM) when the current share value is matching the strike. The share price is $150, and the strike of $150 for both the call and put contracts will be considered ‘at the money’.

An option is ‘In The Money’ (ITM) when the contract has some intrinsic value. The share price is $150, so a call at $140 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value. A put at $160 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value too.

An option is ‘deep in the money’ when the option is ITM and the strike is far from the current share price (for example more than 20%). For example, with a share price of $150, a $100 call will be considered ‘deep in the money’. Same for a $200 put.

Conversely, an option is ‘out of the money’ if there is no intrinsic value. With a $150 share price, a $160 call is ‘out of the money’. A $140 put is ‘out of the money’. The money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value, there is no intrinsic value. An option is ‘deep out of the money’ when the option is OTM and the strike is far from the current share price. For example, with a share price of $150, a $200 call will be considered ‘deep out of the money’. Same for a $100 put.

As the share price goes up and down, depending on the option strikes, it can switch between ITM, to ATM, to OTM. The option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility.

Few key things to note:

* The deeper ITM an option is, the more expensive it is. As it gets deeper ITM, the intrinsic value increases, the extrinsic value decreases. You have a higher chance for the option to be worth something, and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value. The price of Deep ITM options will move very closely to the underlying shares (a positive correlation for calls, a negative correlation for puts).
* The deeper OTM an option is, the less expensive it is. Again, OTM option price is pure extrinsic value. You have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration.
* The maximum extrinsic value is when the option is ATM. It is purely extrinsic value, with barely any intrinsic value. These option strikes are the most sensitive to time, volatility and share price.

Here is an example, with the same share price of $150. For a call, you could get something like this:

Strike = $100 / Premium = $53 / Intrinsic = $50 / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep ITM

Strike = $125 / Premium = $30 / Intrinsic = $25 / Extrinsic = $5 ← ITM

Strike = $150 / Premium = $9   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $9 ← ATM

Strike = $175 / Premium = $5   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $5 ← OTM

Strike = $200 / Premium = $3   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep OTM

You can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction.

It is worth noting that if you have a $100 call and you decide to exercise it, you would directly get $50 of proceeds per share, but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to $0, losing $3 of proceeds. Instead of exercising your call, you are much better off selling your call for $53. In general, there are not many reasons to exercise your options. Selling them is more advantageous.

ucp8pg,investing,Robinhood Lays Off 9% Of Full-Time Employees After Decline In Users,"[https://blog.robinhood.com/](https://blog.robinhood.com/)

*Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev shared the below to Robinhood employees following a company-wide meeting to discuss the changes.*

Today we made the difficult announcement that we are letting go approximately 9% of our full-time employees. While this decision was necessary, it was not one we undertook lightly, and I’d like to share our rationale. 

As you know, throughout 2020 and H1 2021, we went through a period of hyper growth accelerated by several factors including pandemic lockdowns, low interest rates, and fiscal stimulus. We grew net funded accounts from 5M to 22M and revenue from \~$278M in 2019 to over $1.8B in 2021. To meet customer and market demands, we grew our headcount almost 6X from 700 to nearly 3800 in that time period.

This rapid headcount growth has led to some duplicate roles and job functions, and more layers and complexity than are optimal. After carefully considering all these factors, we determined that making these reductions to Robinhood’s staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers.",2022-04-26 23:02:50,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259318,669 days 23:30:01.259318,260,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ucp8pg/robinhood_lays_off_9_of_fulltime_employees_after/
lbnqg1,investing,$CRSR Corsair DD - The Q4 results are basically already out and nobody is talking about it!,"*“While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. \[…\] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked”.* (Big Short)

I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business. 

What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**

Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). 

Here’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33) 

**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document 

  **For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:** 

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million** 

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**   
 

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect: 

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. 

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)): 

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.  
 

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

&#x200B;

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). 

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10): 

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*   
 

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). 

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

   
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).

This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).

\-----

Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!

I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! 

No f\*\*\* way!!!

Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). 

Someone shared it on reddit

[https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0](https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0)

   
They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Corsair is a great company and its results are already out!

m4ojn2,investing,"PSA: If You recently left Robinhood, double check your transferred cost-basis!","If you, like me, used recent events as an excuse to leave the clowncar Robinhood, double-check that the cost basis for the transferred shares is correct. Robinhood apparently managed to send Vanguard random numbers for my portfolio.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong? For my entire portfolio, plus a few dollars/share here, minus a few dollars/share there, not really any reasoning for any of it, but definitely an overall much lower total cost basis than actually should have been there.

If you haven’t left Robinhood yet, get out. This kind of technical incompetence isn’t just embarrassing, it’s scary. You don’t want to keep your money in a clown car.

Edit: For those saying they never received cost basis, note that I only received mine more than a full month later and after I sold some shares - the transfers went through on 2/5-2/8 and I got a statement indicating cost basis was updated on 3/10 for shares which I'd sold (and cost basis information appeared on all other shares). Somehow the date in the cost basis is correct on Vanguard, but the amounts are wonky (roughly the date of the transfer, but the purchase date is correct for some, for others random values). For example, 4 shares of EA came through as 141.50, but my entire history with RH only has one purchase for 147.25 - https://imgur.com/a/GwvQRSH",2021-03-14 05:09:58,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259329,1078 days 17:22:53.259330,676,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m4ojn2/psa_if_you_recently_left_robinhood_double_check/

mj8jqg,investing,Lumber Prices are Up 250% in the last 3 months,"
This weekend I went and bought some Plywood for the house. I couldn’t believe how much I had to pay for some simple 2’x4’s.

The price has gone up by 250% in just the last few months. With the housing boom happening and everyone trying to remodel their house I see this continuing on for a while.

Is anyone else noticing this and trying to take advantage of it?


The two lumber stocks I found are Weyerhaeuser(WY) and Rayonier (RYN) both of the stocks are up slightly but don’t seem outrageous in terms of evaluations.

You can see WY doesn’t have a crazy evaluation. It also peaked in 2007 during the last housing boom.

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

kpeffw,investing,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",2021-01-03 05:19:22,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259390,1148 days 17:13:29.259390,890,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpeffw/reasons_we_may_not_be_in_a_bubble/

If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he'd be selling. He'd just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out.

ix957m,investing,Nikola founder Trevor Milton forfeits $166 million in stock he would have lost any way and gets to keep $3.1 billion under separation deal,"Nikola founder Trevor Milton agreed to forfeit up to roughly $166 million of equity as well as a two-year, $20 million consulting contract as part of his abrupt departure from the company he started. However, the EV executive gets to walk away with more than $3.1 billion in stock as part of a separation agreement reached over the weekend.

Milton, who’s come under scrutiny in recent days, agreed to give up his position and duties as executive chairman of the board as well as all other board seats on the company’s subsidiaries, according to the agreement dated Sunday. The deal strips the 39-year old entrepreneur of any say in the company’s operations and blocks him from attempting to influence any decisions for at least three years, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Milton agreed to advise the company as an unpaid consultant on an ad hoc basis through the end of the year, but he cannot comment about the company on social media, blogs or other online platforms without legal approval from Nikola, according to the deal.

The value of his exit package will vary over time as the start-up’s shares have swung wildly since it went public on June 4. The agreement requires Milton to give up roughly 4.9 million in restricted, performance-based shares valued at $166 million as of Friday’s closing price of $34.19 a share while allowing him to walk away with more than 91.6 million shares that were worth over $3.1 billion.

Nikola declined to comment on Milton’s exit package.

‘Continued service’

The company also accelerated vesting on 600,000 restricted shares worth more than $20 million, allowing Milton to sell stock that was previously locked up until June 3, 2023 sometime within then next six months. Milton really didn’t give up much since the restricted shares he forfeited were contingent on the stock’s performance and his “continued service” at the company through that same date, so he would have lost that equity regardless, according to a separate securities filing.

Milton’s resignation sent shares of the company plummeting in premarket trading before opening at $24.97 – their lowest opening price since the company went public. Shares were trading down about 20% during trading midday Monday.

&#x200B;

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks.",2020-11-03 17:45:13,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259521,1209 days 04:47:38.259522,213,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jnexf3/stop_stressing_about_which_party_is_better_for/

""The order finds that, from at least 2008 through 2016, JPM, through numerous traders on its precious metals and Treasuries trading desks, including the heads of both desks, placed hundreds of thousands of orders to buy or sell certain gold, silver, platinum, palladium, Treasury note, and Treasury bond futures contracts with the intent to cancel those orders prior to execution. Through these spoof orders, the traders intentionally sent false signals of supply or demand designed to deceive market participants into executing against other orders they wanted filled. According to the order, in many instances, JPM traders acted with the intent to manipulate market prices and ultimately did cause artificial prices.""

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",2021-03-17 18:44:24,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259543,1075 days 03:48:27.259544,615,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/

nfhan1,investing,Why do passive investors frequently say “past performance does not guarantee future results” but they also say to invest in index funds and use past statistics to predict a future return rate of 10%?,"Passive investors say not to pick an outperforming mutual fund or ETF because you don’t know that it will outperform in the future. However, they look at market returns from the past to predict or expect returns in the future. Just because businesses have grown at a rate of 10% annually since 1926, why should investors expect 10% in the future?

It seems illogical to have your retirement rely on a system that is based on past performance from only the past 95 years. If a 20 year old starts investing today until retirement at 65, that’s 45 years. 45 years is 47% of the S&P 500’s existence, yet people say there’s enough evidence to expect a certain future return. If we had 1,000 years of historical data showing that the S&P returns 10% annually, I think that it would be ok to say that 10% can be expected for a 45 year window of retirement investing.

Saying that 10% returns can be expected in the future because thats what’s happened over the past 95 years is just using past performance to project future results. The passive investor frequently says that it does not make sense to expect certain future results because of past results.",2021-05-18 17:52:08,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259591,1013 days 04:40:43.259591,546,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nfhan1/why_do_passive_investors_frequently_say_past/

gndux9,investing,"Number of unpaid credit card accounts in April increased 10,000% from a year ago. Number of unpaid auto loans up 350%.","From WSJ:

Millions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s financial devastation.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.

Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.

The numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.

The spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people’s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.

As coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.

eo5ie9,investing,Tesla hit $500 and 90B Market cap. If it grows 10% more Elon will get hist first portion of his compensation which is 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding shares.,"**CEO Performance Award Details**

The performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.

* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.
* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.

For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.

7sjdij,investing,Today was the day. This has been a long time coming.,"https://i.imgur.com/NaBz0ll.jpg

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

fauzs4,investing,My Coronavirus Stock Portfolio strategy,"Thought I would add something for a change, take this FWIW. Here is my strategy: 

1 - DCA
I am buying this week. I will be buying next week and the week after. Catch a falling knife, wait for the bottom, blahs blahs blahs. I am buying. I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well

2 - Unsubscribe from this sub
Seriously. This place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately. Last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs. Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.

Take a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.

Just my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental & physical health is key.

https://www.nme.com/news/music/hundreds-k-pop-releases-removed-spotify-worldwide-2890528

> Spotify launched in South Korea on February 1, 2021, but did so without music from artists with licensing deals under Kakao M, including IU, Zico and more.

> Now, releases distributed by the Korean label have been removed from Spotify around the world. Kakao M distributes a large share of Korean popular music, with 37.5 percent of the songs featured on the 2020 Top 400 Yearly Song Chart from Gaon Music Chart under the company.

[Also on BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56237626).

Kakao M claiming it was Spotify removing it:

https://www.soompi.com/article/1456887wpp/kakao-m-releases-statement-explaining-that-spotify-was-the-one-to-end-their-licensing-agreement

> [...] later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M’s part.

While this is clearly over compensation, Spotify needs to rectify this asap. From their [own news release](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-02-24/from-bts-to-blackpink-the-power-of-k-pop-has-no-bounds/), K-pop is a huge part of why people use their service:

> Between January 2014 and January 2020, K-pop's share of listening on Spotify increased by more than 1,800%.

> Since Spotify released its first K-Pop flagship playlist, K-Pop Daebak, in 2014 (and then a massive hub dedicated to the genre in 2015), there have been more than 41 billion K-Pop streams on Spotify. From rising artists to international collaborations, there’s something for both new and old K-Pop lovers on the platform.

> Top-streamed K-Pop artists on Spotify include BTS, BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE, and Red Velvet. In 2019, BTS was the first group from Asia to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. And, as of February 2020, the boy band reached a new milestone: more than 8 billion streams (8 billion streams!) on the platform.

g7cza6,investing,I lost 25% of my savings this week. Here is what I learned.,"After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and ""hit it big"".

I spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in.

Tuesday morning was not fun.

Here's what I learned:

* **Don’t ever buy something you don’t FULLY understand.** On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world’s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn’t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn’t know that the real risk was that I didn’t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren’t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.
* **Don’t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank.** Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they've said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false: [https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png) I thought this meant that USO had to sell all those contracts and move into May contracts on Monday. I thought USO was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of. But that's not how this works.
* **The word “ETF” is used extremely loosely.** An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are “attempting to track daily movements of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. An ""ETF"" is just a fund. Don’t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.
* **Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there.** As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.
* **Don’t fuck around with leveraged ETFs.** In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF “HOU.to” at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn’t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can’t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn’t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.
* **Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything.** [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) \- which I purchased into - is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it’s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it’s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. Everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, yet millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.
* **The biggest lesson in these oil ETF’s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market.** A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.
* **Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now.** The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - it’s quite certain that there are “sub prime mortgage backed security” equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It’s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there.

mijlje,investing,U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%,"https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.

v96u59,investing,"Inflation rose 8.6% in May, highest since 1981","[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/consumer-price-index-may-2022.html)

 

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.",2022-06-10 12:37:51,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259809,625 days 09:55:00.259810,917,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/v96u59/inflation_rose_86_in_may_highest_since_1981/

CEO Jeff Bezos said in April that 175 million customers have used Prime Video in the last year. Those numbers would put Amazon within spitting distance of Netflix’s nearly 208 million subscribers.

Shoppers paid sharply higher prices for a variety of goods in June as  inflation kept its hold on a slowing U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics reported Wednesday.

The consumer price index, a broad  measure of everyday goods and services, soared 9.1% from a year ago,  above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. That marked another month of the  fastest pace for inflation going back to December 1981.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI increased 5.9%, compared to the 5.5% estimate.

Sterling dipped as low as $1.1032 at 12:00 p.m. London time, around an hour after the measures were unveiled in the House of Commons.

The pound has been on a precipitous fall against the greenback this year, hitting levels this month not seen since 1985.

Friday’s measures were billed by the government as heralding a new era for the U.K. focused on growth, and included a mix of tax cuts and investment incentives for businesses.


Cuts include reduced taxes on property purchases effective immediately, a reversal of the 1.25% National Insurance hike, and a 1% decrease in basic income tax. The highest level of income tax effective at £150k or more (45%) is now completely scrapped.

\- the SAFE act for MSOs to get access to banking  

\- uplisting to NYSE (US MSOs are currently traded as OTC leaving the vast majority of institutional investors on the outside looking in for now)

\- more states legalizing independently 

Decriminalization even without full legalization would be a major boon for growth but is not even necessary for growth to continue with more states legalizing and/or relaxing restrictions on MSOs. The 4 major players (Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve, and Curaleaf) are all on top in this. They maintained solid financials, limited debt/losses, huge expansion across all medical/recreational states and are almost certainly going to remain the big 4 post-legalization. A play across these 4 covers the majority of gains we'll see leading up to and after legalization.

Joint Statement by the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC
March 12, 2023
WASHINGTON, DC -- The following statement was released by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg:

Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system. This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth.

After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.  No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.

We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole.  As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.

Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.

Finally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. 

The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry. Those reforms combined with today’s actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings remain safe.",2023-03-12 22:44:17,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259888,349 days 23:48:34.259888,894,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11pscz8/us_government_guarantees_all_silicon_valley_bank/

fdo19w,investing,PSA to anyone thinking of moving their brokerage accounts out of Robinhood: you do NOT need to liquidate all of your assets before transferring your positions out. Selling your positions triggers a taxable event and creates a capital gains tax liability. Simply submit an ACATS transfer.,"All you need to do is initiate an ACATS transfer at your preferred receiving brokerage and your assets will transfer over in-kind, meaning that your stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc will transfer and cost basis for tax purposes will transfer over as well. 

All of the major brokers such as TD, Fidelity, Schwab, E*Trade, etc support ACAT transfers. 

Note: proprietary or non-transferable positions may still need to be liquidated, but all publicly traded instruments should be fine.  These transfers typically take 5 business days and you should refrain from transacting on the account when you are ready to transfer. Don’t have open limit orders, expiring options, recurring ACHs open otherwise RH will reject your request. 

Godspeed!!

Edit: I am not a tax advisor so nothing I say should be construed as tax advice, so I cannot tell you what you should or should not do.  Please consult a tax professional if you have specific questions.

Edit #2: Again, I am NOT offering advice to anyone. This post should not be interpreted as me telling you to transfer your account. That decision is fully YOURS to make. 

Edit #3: I kind of touched on this, but an ACATS transfer will lock your account for the duration of the transfer, preventing you from trading. You need to be ok with not trading for ~5 business days (this can take longer depending on how long it takes the broker to review) so be cognizant of that given the market’s recent volatility.",2020-03-05 02:06:23,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259907,1452 days 20:26:28.259907,229,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdo19w/psa_to_anyone_thinking_of_moving_their_brokerage/

ukaei2,investing,Nvidia fined $5.5 million by SEC for hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners,"Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”""

[Edit] lots of people asking why this is illegal.

According to the investigation, Nvidia conducted internal research which indicated this was how the cards were being used. Instead of notifying shareholders about this, they claimed to be increasing their market share in the gaming sphere. Of course, this becomes problematic for investors when crypto goes into a bear market (like now), and investors are left holding bags wondering why everyone is buying second hand cards from miners all of a sudden.",2022-05-07 10:22:41,2024-02-25 22:32:51.259926,659 days 12:10:10.259926,261,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ukaei2/nvidia_fined_55_million_by_sec_for_hiding_how/

nabnrv,investing,Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance History,"How could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

Edit as of Dec 2021:

A few months have passed since this original post, and it appears now that ARKK has actually underperformed the S&P on AUM adjusted returns. That means, given every net new dollar she receives...is that dollar best spent invested in ARKK or something like VTI? Some story old as time for financial bubbles. Early investors win, investors that come around or after peak AUM lose. The later investor's inflows where the raison d'etre the holding's prices went up, benefitting those at the top of the pyramid. 

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500** (sort of), but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance. Caveat that this does not consider dollar-weighted returns...ie given every dollar inflow she receives, is she able to beat then S&P 500 with those net-new dollars? Market returns can be misleading if not adjusted for AUM weighting. 

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: -1.96%

-   VGT: 13.73%

-   IWF: 7.01%

-   PRNHX: 7.79%

&nbsp;

**2017: Cathie OUTPERFORMS T Rowe, OUTPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

>""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

Many speculated that 10 year yields were going up due to inflation fears and this was weighing down on companies where earnings are mostly in the future, aka most SPACs.

However, today's data not only reduces the fear of that inflation but it actually suggests that the bond yields might be going up simply because our economy is recovering faster than expected.

x7yo4z,investing,"Porsche IPO is so corrupt that if it goes through, I’m never investing into German stocks again","**TLDR**: the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free. This is the main reason for the IPO. The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this. VW and its long-term strategy are thrown into disarray.

**TLDR (with light details):**

1. The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies. But they want full control of the Porsche company.
2. They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them.
3. The family will get additional 25% of the Porsche, which will give them full control of the company.
4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.
5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.

**Long story**

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.

If this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.

The ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company -> Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company (>50% of voting rights)  
>  
>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> Porsche Company (>50% of voting rights)

The money flow is like this:

>The family “buys” 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  
>  
>VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  
>  
>The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it’s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.

IPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.

Let’s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a “diesel gate” scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.

Now, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?

What’s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.

The right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.

**My positions:**

I owned VW stock for a while and sold at \~2x profit after the war in Ukraine started but was planning to buy back later. Now, however, if the IPO goes through, I’m not touching this stock, or any other German stocks for that matter.",2022-09-07 07:26:43,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439486,536 days 15:06:10.439487,238,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/x7yo4z/porsche_ipo_is_so_corrupt_that_if_it_goes_through/

>The Seattle-based company, which operates a real-estate brokerage and home-listings website, said the decisions were made because it is predicting that the real-estate market is going to be smaller next year and its home-flipping business is losing money.

gal8gs,investing,Elon Musk says orders to stay home are ‘fascist’ in expletive-laced rant during Tesla earnings call,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lashed out at government stay at home orders as “fascist” in an expletive-laced rant on Tesla’s Q1 2020 earnings call.

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month"," [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/herding-by-naive-robinhood-traders-may-be-good-signal-to-short?sref=xTkgnLSf](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/herding-by-naive-robinhood-traders-may-be-good-signal-to-short?sref=xTkgnLSf)

&#x200B;

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

[Read more: Robinhood Users Weren’t as Reckless as Portrayed During Rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/robinhood-users-are-a-bit-less-nuts-than-you-were-led-to-believe)

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

“How information is displayed can both help and hurt investors,” wrote the team, which also included Xing Huang at Washington University in St. Louis and Chris Schwarz at the University of California, Irvine. “The simplified user interface influences investors decision.”",2020-11-22 15:29:49,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439564,1190 days 07:03:04.439564,374,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jyxfkr/when_robinhood_users_pile_into_a_stock_the/
gjo61z,investing,Can we get the old r/investing back? This sub has become a cancerous place for green investors to learn how to lose money.,"The recent surge in popularity of Wallstreetbets sub has brought an influx of people to r/investing peddling harmful information for new investors, and it pains me to see a sub that was such a great resource for me when I started out investing become infested with losing strategies. Study after study shows that 90% of options traders lose money, that the vast majority of people who try to time the market lose out in the long run, and that almost 92% of actively managed large cap funds lost to the S&P 500 over the last 15 year period. Despite these facts, these losing strategies have been all I have been seeing on this sub over the last few months.

If the data isn't convincing for you, I've got a story for you about the smartest man I know. Only person I know who got a perfect score on the SATs. Undergraduate and graduate degree in economics and finance from an Ivy League school, after which he became a CFA. Earned multi, multi, millions as a portfolio manager, before retiring young in his late 30's or early 40's. You want to know how he invests now that he is retired? Index funds. Do you want to know where he told me most of his hedge fund and mutual fund manager friends invest their own money? Index funds. 

Honestly, over the past few months, wallstreetbets has been a considerably less harmful sub for new investors than here. There seems to be an overarching theme over there that they know they are gamblers and dumbasses, where the options traders here seem to think they are the smartest guys in the room. At least they have funny memes over there to help ease the pain when they inevitably lose their money.

I don't know what the solution to this is, I'm not sure if banning advice that has been statistically proven to lose money for most investors is a good idea. All I know is that this sub has become a place that is peddling advice that will lose new investors money, and I think it's atrocious. End rant.

Edit: the amount of disinformation being up voted in this thread is staggering, people not knowing basic things like what the difference between an ETF and an index fund is and people thinking that portfolio managers only get compensated when they are successful. Case in point.

Edit 2: Since everyone seems to think I am saying everyone should just throw everything in VTI and call it a day because they think that is the only index fund that exits, I'll clarify. If you feel like you have very strong knowledge that a particular sector will outperform, or if you have done a lot of homework and think for example growth stocks are going to crash, it's fine in my opinion to use a low cost index fund to overweight your portfolio towards value. For example, if you think large cap growth is going to continue to outperform, feel free to buy some Fidelity large cap growth index at .035 expense ratio. If you think tech is the way to go, dip your toe into some .08 expense ratio FTEC tech index fund. Hell if you have a stiffy for groceries, go ahead and treat yourself to some .13 % expense ratio XLP consumer staples index (I personally wouldn't buy anything with .1% exp ratio or over, but I don't it's a big mistake for someone to do that.) Using cheap indexes doesn't mean only buy things that completely emulate the market. You can diverge from the market as long as you do it cheaply and within reason.",2020-05-14 15:09:54,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439569,1382 days 07:22:59.439569,608,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gjo61z/can_we_get_the_old_rinvesting_back_this_sub_has/

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shares plunged 20% late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.

Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and from macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions. read more

The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, with another $15 billion in value lost from peers Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N).

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more

Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market.

The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""

The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.

Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more

""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

li6vyf,investing,Forgotten lessons of 2008 that are even more relevant today,"In 2010 legendary investor and founder of the Baupost Group Seth Klarman described in his annual letter 20 lessons from the financial crisis which were either never learned or else immediately forgotten by most market participants. With him at the helm the Baupost Group has averaged around 18% and that since 1982 -  a spectacular return. Some of these lessons are even more relevant today. I took the most important ones and updated it for the current market.

>Things that have never happened before are bound to occur with some regularity. You must always be prepared for the unexpected, including sudden, sharp downward swings in markets and the economy. Whatever adverse scenario you can contemplate, reality can be far worse.

Nassim Taleb calls these “Black Swans”:  an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight)hindsight. Examples would be the Internet, the personal Computer, World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and of course the Coronavirus.

These all changed countries or continents for decades.  With shutdown still in place in several countries in the world the economy’s output is much lower than it was at the end of 2019 -  yet we reached an all time high in the stock market. New Mutations are evolving and there might be a sharp downturn in the future or there might not. History taught us that market crashes are much more common than we think. So it is important to be diversified in different asset classes, industries and countries to be protected against those changes.

&#x200B;

>When excesses such as lax lending standards become widespread and persist for some time, people are lulled into a false sense of security, creating an even more dangerous situation. In some cases, excesses migrate beyond regional or national borders, raising the ante for investors and governments. These excesses will eventually end, triggering a crisis at least in proportion to the degree of the excesses. Correlations between asset classes may be surprisingly high when leverage rapidly unwinds.

With interest rates in Europe being partly negative and extremely low in the US, people are lulled into borrowing to get onto the Party of rising stocks, and that on margin. Margin on Portfolio reached an all time high in December of 2020 and the number of retail traders thanks to Robin Hood exploded even with the recent controversy. In addition - central banks in Europe and the US are printing money like there is no tomorrow. These money policies have driven stocks to a new high. And the excess of government debt mirrored that progression. Action always have consequences - but however harsh they may be one thing is certain: If the current price is higher, the returns won’t be as great in the future.

&#x200B;

>Nowhere does it say that investors should strive to make every last dollar of potential profit; consideration of risk must never take a backseat to return. Conservative positioning entering a crisis is crucial: it enables one to maintain long-term oriented, clear thinking, and to focus on new opportunities while others are distracted or even forced to sell. Portfolio hedges must be in place before a crisis hits. One cannot reliably or affordably increase or replace hedges that are rolling off during a financial crisis.

We all chase profits, that is just how it is. However conservative positioning and a long-term oriented perspective is crucial. Most people in 2000 thought they would buy the dip when their favourite stocks started to decline, however the decline didn’t stop. The Nasdaq posted a loss of 77%, which would take 15 years to regain the dotcom bubble. During the financial crisis many couldn’t sell their stock because there were no buyers - even retail investors that thought they could get out couldn’t.

During it Janus Funds were similar to ARK today. Investing in modern technology companies and industry they were one of the top cutting edge technologies. Janus were lauded as great money managers but the end of the bubble resulted in brutal loses. Cathie Wood is one of the smartest investors today, but one has to keep in mind the inherent risk that comes with her investment strategy.

Similarly we saw extreme loses in GME. Chasing after returns purely on performance will not result in great results.

&#x200B;

>Risk is not inherent in an investment; it is always relative to the price paid. Uncertainty is not the same as risk. Indeed, when great uncertainty – such as in the fall of 2008 – drives securities prices to especially low levels, they often become less risky investments.

This is the quintessential art of investing. Your returns will entirely depend on what price you paid. Microsoft was a great company, but buying it during the dotcom bubble would leave you 15 years with no returns and several other well known companies like Cisco or Intel never reached their dot-com peak. Your returns are entirely dependent on the price you pay and so is the risk factor.

&#x200B;

>Do not trust financial market risk models. Reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled. Attention to risk must be a 24/7/365 obsession, with people – not computers – assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time. Despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics, the markets are governed by behavioral science, not physical science.

Because of this behavior we see certain securities being extremely highly valued like Zoom at the moment and certain sectors being very depressed like oil until recently. Yet oil is seen as extremely risky, even though the projected use of oil will increase in the next 10 years. That means that you can find bargains all the time. Those bargains are declared risky -  while the overvalued stocks are declared safe. Microsoft after the dotcom bubble only recovered in 2016. 15 years of no gains at all -  yet now Microsoft is treated like a company that will be a great stock forever. It is a great company, but the same was thought about companies like Polaroid or Kodak - we saw how it turned out.

&#x200B;

>Do not accept principal risk while investing short-term cash: the greedy effort to earn a few extra basis points of yield inevitably leads to the incurrence of greater risk, which increases the likelihood of losses and severe illiquidity at precisely the moment when cash is needed to cover expenses, to meet commitments, or to make compelling long-term investments.

This can be highly dangerous and I see it all the time here on reddit. Someone wants to use the money in 3-5 years to buy a house, yet instead of proposing a portfolio that is safe and diversified in several asset classes, most propose a stock only portfolio and sometimes even sector or ARK ETFs. Research has shown that a stock only portfolio will beat pretty much every other asset allocation -  that is over the long term. Due to the ups and downs of the market it doesn’t guarantee returns in 3-5 years or even worse can lead to loses. From 1929-1954,1973-1982 and from 2000-2013 the S&P 500 has shown long stretches of no absolute return. Investing before a correction that you cannot foresee would result in either big loses or in the inability to purchase that house -  often both. So be conservative when you need the money.

&#x200B;

>The latest trade of a security creates a dangerous illusion that its market price approximates its true value. This mirage is especially dangerous during periods of market exuberance. The concept of ""private market value"" as an anchor to the proper valuation of a business can also be greatly skewed during ebullient times and should always be considered with a healthy degree of skepticism.

This is especially true today. Many stocks are currently at outrageous prices. I don’t talk about the FANGMAN stocks -  these have great growth and while still being historically overvalued not outrageously so. Several EV/Green/Biotech/Weed/Technology stocks are seen as the next big Google without decent cash flows and while competing in the same space.

This is especially true for unprofitable companies at the moment. According to Joel Greenblatt:  If you bought every company that lost money in 2019 that had a market cap over $1 billion, and so they’re about 261 companies, you’ll be up 85 percent so far until today. Something like that won’t be sustainable.Looking at the fundamentals behind the business often makes it clear how unreasonable some of these numbers are - and what returns should be expected of them (often negative)

&#x200B;

>You must buy on the way down. There is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up, and far less competition among buyers. It is almost always better to be too early than too late, but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy.

We saw that during the financial crisis and also again in 2020. Those that bought on the way down were generously rewarded. You never know when the bottom will hit especially since everyone will run around in panic like a beheaded henn. Researching the fundamentals of a company one can score great businesses for cheap. However they might go down a bit in the short term due to market panic.

&#x200B;

>Financial innovation can be highly dangerous, though almost no one will tell you this. New financial products are typically created for sunny days and are almost never stress-tested for stormy weather. Securitization is an area that almost perfectly fits this description; markets for securitized assets such as subprime mortgages completely collapsed in 2008 and have not fully recovered. Ironically, the government is eager to restore the securitization markets back to their pre-collapse stature.

As SPACs and Bitcoin dominate the current market this warning is very important. SPACs and the companies behind them haven’t had the greatest return over the long term. With the explosion of SPACs going public, chances are high that those financial products can be very dangerous. Add the risk that SPAC managers often get big compensation packages and try to hide information to increase the price (DOJ Investigation from Clover), these investments should be taken with the utmost caution. Not only that but they also compete in the same space.

The same applies to bitcoin. While I believe that cryptocurrencies will have a bright future, they have yet to be tested during prolonged market downturn where the market was negative not just a few week but several months or even years. No one know what the price will be then and some investors might wake up to a bad surprise. It is important to know these risks.

&#x200B;

>Ratings agencies are highly conflicted, unimaginative dupes. They are blissfully unaware of adverse selection and moral hazard. Investors should never trust them.

That what makes short seller research so important. While there are a lot of crocks in the financial market (both on the long and the short side), these people often find what the rating agencies or investment banks ignore. If you invest into a company and there is a short report don’t dismiss it - often they include information that was previously overlooked.

&#x200B;

>Be sure that you are well compensated for illiquidity – especially illiquidity without control – because it can create particularly high opportunity costs.

The OTC market absolutely exploded in 2020. Many of these are highly illiquid. Be prepared for the risk.

&#x200B;

>Beware leverage in all its forms. Borrowers – individual, corporate, or government – should always match fund their liabilities against the duration of their assets. Borrowers must always remember that capital markets can be extremely fickle, and that it is never safe to assume a maturing loan can be rolled over. Even if you are unleveraged, the leverage employed by others can drive dramatic price and valuation swings; sudden unavailability of leverage in the economy may trigger an economic downturn.

Everyone takes debt at the moment. It is so cheap that many companies use debt to do buybacks or otherwise increase their price. Other people trade on margin and governments don't seem to care about debt. That can be highly dangerous. No one can control interests rates over the long run and bankruptcy is the most surefire way to delete any investment returns. Peter Lynch said: “If you have no debt it is very hard to go bankrupt”. While businesses with little or no debt might not rise to the same degree, they will reduce the chance of a wipeout significantly.

&#x200B;

>When a government official says a problem has been ""contained,"" pay no attention.

&#x200B;

>The government – the ultimate short-term-oriented player – cannot withstand much pain in the economy or the financial markets. Bailouts and rescues are likely to occur, though not with sufficient predictability for investors to comfortably take advantage. The government will take enormous risks in such interventions, especially if the expenses can be conveniently deferred to the future. Some of the price-tag is in the form of back- stops and guarantees, whose cost is almost impossible to determine.

We saw that in March the Fed stepped in and bailed out the market. A decrease in interest rates and intense money printing. However the question is: How long can it continue and what will happen to those expenses in the future? All action has consequences and we saw that some of them can end quite bad.

Seth Klarman also added some false lessons, that are relevant without commentary.

**False Lessons**

1. There are no long-term lessons – ever.
2. Bad things happen, but really bad things do not. Do buy the dips, especially the lowest quality securities when they come under pressure, because declines will quickly be
3. There is no amount of bad news that the markets cannot see past.
4. If you’ve just stared into the abyss, quickly forget it: the lessons of history can only hold you back.
5. Excess capacity in people, machines, or property will be quickly absorbed.
6. Markets need not be in sync with one another. Simultaneously, the bond market can be priced for sustained tough times, the equity market for a strong recovery, and gold for high inflation. Such an apparent disconnect is indefinitely sustainable.
7. In a crisis, stocks of financial companies are great investments, because the tide is bound to turn. Massive losses on bad loans and soured investments are irrelevant to value; improving trends and future prospects are what matter, regardless of whether profits will have to be used to cover loan losses and equity shortfalls for years to come.
8. The government can reasonably rely on debt ratings when it forms programs to lend money to buyers of otherwise unattractive debt instruments.
9. The government can indefinitely control both short-term and long-term interest rates.
10. The government can always rescue the markets or interfere with contract law whenever it deems convenient with little or no apparent cost. (Investors believe this now and, worse still, the government believes it as well. We are probably doomed to a lasting legacy of government tampering with financial markets and the economy, which is likely to create the mother of all moral hazards. The government is blissfully unaware of the wisdom of Friedrich Hayek: “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”)

ip1731,investing,"Tesla, snubbed by the S&P 500, quickly completes $5 billion stock sale","The old Wall Street adage is to ""sell high."" Tesla did just that.

A week ago, Tesla announced it would sell $5 billion worth of stock at market prices ""from time to time."" Tuesday it announced it had completed that sale as of Friday.

The exact number of shares sold, and thus the average price of each sale, was not disclosed. Tesla shares have fallen sharply in the recent sell-off of tech stocks. Shares reached a split-adjusted record high close of $498.32 on August 31, but have lost 16% of their value since then through Friday's close. And shares were down another 11% in pre-market trading even before the Tuesday's filing.


The sell-off could be because Tesla was not added to the S&P 500 index, as many investors were expecting would happen, given its market value and recent record of sustained profitability. Being added to the S&amp;amp;P would have forced additional purchases by fund managers whose holders must mirror the blue chip index.

Shares of Tesla are still up about 400% since the start of the year, even with last week's sell-off.

The sale of stock is the second such offering Tesla has done this year to take advantage of the skyrocketing stock price. In February the company raised $2.3 billion through the sale of 3 billion shares. Adjusted for the recent split, that stock sale was at an average price of $151.60 a share.

CEO Elon Musk dismissed the idea of the need for sales of additional shares when asked about it by analysts in January.

“We're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly,"" Musk said on a January 29 call, when the company posted its first annual profit. ""There is no artificial hold back on expenditures ... So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money.""

But soon thereafter Tesla decided it didn't make sense to not take advantage of its climbing share price. And if it turns out that its shares hit a peak last week that it might not reach again for a little while, then Tesla apparently sold additional shares at close to that high point.

>Zillow, the digital real estate company, said on Tuesday that it’s exiting Offers, its business that buys and flips homes, and eliminating 25% of its workforce.

>The announcement was attached to Zillow’s third-quarter earnings report. The company’s revenue and earnings missed analysts’ estimates.

>“We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated,” Zillow CEO Rich Barton said in the release. “Continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.”

>The stock dropped about 7.5% in extended trading following a 10% plunge during regular market hours. The shares are now down about 10% for the year as of Tuesday’s close.

>Here are the key numbers from earnings:

>Earnings per share: loss of 95 cents adjusted vs. profit of 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts
Revenue: $1.74 billion vs. $2.01 billion expected by Refinitiv
Revenue in Zillow’s Offers business, which competes with Opendoor, climbed to $1.17 billion in the quarter. That’s way up from $186 million a year earlier, which was in the middle of the pandemic and in a dry period for transactions. However, the homes segment, which is mostly Offers, lost $422 million in the quarter, producing an overall net loss at the company.

>Shares of Opendoor rose 7% in extended trading. The stock plunged alongside Zillow earlier in the day, dropping 15% at the close.

>Zillow launched Offers in December 2019, starting with Southern California markets. The iBuying, or instant buying, product allowed homeowners to sell their home to Zillow for cash, eliminating a lengthy bidding, sales and closing process. They also didn’t have to worry about costly repairs before putting their house on the market.

>“After closing on a home, Zillow will take care of necessary repairs, working with local contractors to complete projects like a fresh coat of paint, servicing HVAC units and other work a typical homeowner would do to get their home ready for sale,” Zillow said in a press release at the time.

>But the home-flipping market proved to be a drag for a company that had built its brand on listing homes across the country and helping buyers and sellers connect through a marketplace. Prior to shuttering the business, the company said on Monday that it would stop buying houses through the end of the year, citing tight labor and supply markets.

>“We’re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,” said Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow’s operating chief, in a statement this week. “We have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings.”

>Barton told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” after the report that Zillow’s ultimate failure was its inability to predict housing prices accurately. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market dried up. It then bounced back dramatically, and prices in many markets have climbed to record levels.

>For the home-flipping business to be profitable, a company has to be able to sell a home for more than the purchase price and have enough margin remaining to cover all the other costs, such as maintenance and sales and marketing expenses. Barton said the company realized that it’s not in a position to accurately predict where home prices will be in six months “within a narrow margin of error.”

>Additionally, Barton said the Offers product reaches only a small sliver of the company’s overall audience, which is effectively the entire market of homebuyers and sellers across the country.

>Zillow’s internet, media and technology business grew revenue 16% in the quarter to $480 million, with gross profit of just over $130 million.

>“We just determined that being an iBuyer was too risky, too volatile and ultimately addressed too few customers,” Barton said. He added that, in closing the business, “the logic is clear, the emotion is difficult” because of the layoffs.

>Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zillow was looking to sell 7,000 homes for $2.8 billion to institutional investors, as it looked to unload its portfolio of properties. Some of those sales would be for below the purchase price, Bloomberg said.

>Barton didn’t confirm or deny the numbers in the Bloomberg report. He told CNBC that the company has always sold to those types of buyers since entering the market, and he acknowledged that Zillow does have properties that it needs to sell. The company bought 3,805 houses in the second quarter and sold 2,086 in that period.

>“We’re not in any kind of fire sale,” he said. “We’ll wind down the inventory in an orderly way.”

w3lp2f,investing,Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers,"* Surging inflation and interest rates are hammering American consumers and weighing on the housing market.

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

j0d46n,investing,FT: Nikola founder bought truck designs from third party,"
* * *
https://www.ft.com/content/9bd5e3f3-4d09-458c-b390-bc94b1f4a024

The original design for Nikola’s flagship truck was purchased by founder Trevor Milton from a designer in Croatia, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, despite company claims in a 2018 lawsuit that the vehicle was initially designed by Mr Milton “in his basement”.

The truck, the Nikola One, is at the centre of a $2bn lawsuit with Tesla, in which Nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents. Nikola claims in that lawsuit that Mr Milton began designing the model in 2013, with other company staff later working on it.

In a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week, Tesla alleged that Nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself, but from Adriano Mudri, a designer based in Croatia.

Two people with knowledge of the transaction told the Financial Times that the Nikola founder bought the designs in 2015 after meeting Mr Mudri while visiting electric supercar maker Rimac in Croatia.

While Tesla’s filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings, it does not contain details about the transaction, explain that money was exchanged, or that Mr Milton himself orchestrated the purchase.

The latest twist comes with Nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own, covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos. Nikola said it never claimed it made the components.

In a report that sent Nikola’s shares tanking, Mr Milton was accused of spreading an “ocean of lies” about the company’s technology and its products by short seller Hindenburg Research.

A little over a week later, Mr Milton decided to leave the company, telling staff he planned to defend himself “against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors”. The 39-year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks.

The lawsuit with Tesla, filed during Mr Milton’s tenure, centres on the origins of the designs for the “Nikola One” truck.

The company claims that Mr Milton worked for two years on the truck before, unsatisfied with his designs, he hired designer Steve Jennes in 2015. The lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process.

When it was finished, Nikola had spent “several million dollars developing the Nikola One”, according to the lawsuit.

In its rebuttal, Tesla said that the designs for the model originated from Mr Mudri, a designer at Rimac, who had dubbed it the “Road Runner”. The design’s origins could raise further questions about Nikola’s intellectual property.

“Trevor Milton chose not to disclose the Road Runner concept truck to the [US Patent and Trademark Office] with deceptive intent,” Tesla said in its filing.

Nikola said: “The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Antonio Mudri’s designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.”

According to several people with knowledge of the deal, Mr Milton sought, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with Rimac on a range of projects in 2015.

On a trip to Rimac’s headquarters on the outskirts of Zagreb, he met Mr Mudri, the company’s designer, who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project.

Mr Milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual 3D model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Mr Mudri, according to two people.

The Road Runner name lingered for months. A person familiar with the development of the Nikola One said that “Road Runner . . . was the internal name for Nikola’s project the entire time we worked on it”.

A screenshot of a Nikola document seen by the Financial Times, shows 13 people being invited to collaborate on the “Nikola Roadrunner Prototype Project”.

Another screenshot shows an early version of Nikola’s website depicting a truck that appears identical to the Road Runner in Tesla’s court filing.

Nikola did not mention Mr Mudri, or Rimac, or say that the designs were purchased, in its 2018 filing against Tesla.

Representatives for Mr Milton declined to comment. Rimac also declined to comment.",2020-09-26 20:22:50,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439670,1247 days 02:10:03.439671,414,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j0d46n/ft_nikola_founder_bought_truck_designs_from_third/
o9lqxk,investing,"Financial Times - US cannot afford housing market ‘boom and bust’, warns Fed official","https://www.ft.com/content/ff83ed04-3bb5-444a-9af0-1b466201ef67

A senior Federal Reserve official has warned the US cannot afford a “boom and bust cycle” in the housing market that would threaten financial stability, in a sign of growing concern over rising property prices at the central bank.

“It’s very important for us to get back to our 2 per cent inflation target but the goal is for that to be sustainable,” Eric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times. “And for that to be sustainable, we can’t have a boom and bust cycle in something like real estate.

“I’m not predicting that we’ll necessarily have a bust. But I do think it’s worth paying close attention to what’s happening in the housing market,” he said.

According to data released by the National Association of Realtors last week, the median price for sales of existing homes was up 23.6 per cent year-on-year in May, topping $350,000 for the first time.

Rosengren said that in the Boston property market, it had become common for cash-only buyers to prevail in bidding contests, and that some have been declining home inspections to gain an edge with sellers.

“You don’t want too much exuberance in the housing market,” Rosengren said. “I would just highlight that boom and bust cycles in the real estate market have occurred in the United States multiple times, and around the world, and frequently as a source of financial stability concerns.”

He said the roaring housing market should be a factor as the central bank considers slowing or removing some of the hefty monetary support for the economy introduced during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Fed has been purchasing $40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities per month alongside $80bn in monthly Treasury debt as part of its asset purchase programme.

Fed officials are now beginning to discuss trimming that bond buying. And Rosengren said that “when it is appropriate” to begin that process, mortgage-backed securities purchases should be reduced at the same rate as Treasury purchases. That would mean the direct support to housing finance would wind down more quickly.

“That would imply that we would stop purchasing MBS well before we stopped purchasing Treasury securities,” he said.

James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, is among those who have called for the Fed to re-evaluate its support for the housing market against the backdrop of what he noted were broader concerns about a nascent bubble.

Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed president, has also advocated for the purchases to end “sooner rather than later”, especially given mounting evidence of financial speculation in the housing market.

The Fed has said that it would begin reducing its asset purchases only once it had made “substantial further progress” towards its goals of 2 per cent average inflation and full employment.

Given the rapid recovery, Rosengren said “the conditions for thinking about whether we’ve attained substantial further progress will probably be met before the beginning of next year”.

The latest economic projections by the Fed showed central bank officials increasing interest rates from their current rock-bottom level in 2023, earlier than previously forecast. They also exposed a greater divide within the Federal Open Market Committee on the expected path of monetary policy than had been the case.

“There’s a great deal of uncertainty in the forecast,” Rosengren said. “Some people are going to have very rapid growth [and] the conditions for tightening policy may be happening sooner. And other people are going to think that the recovery is going to be a little slower.”",2021-06-28 14:47:53,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439676,972 days 07:45:00.439676,1308,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o9lqxk/financial_times_us_cannot_afford_housing_market/
stwrnr,investing,"I've documented every ""major"" reason lumber has skyrocketed. Here is why you should care.","This is not limited in scope to people who invest in lumber ETF's like WOOD.

There is a lot of uncertainty around inflation, supply shortages, and corporate profits. To try to figure out what the hell is going on, I looked into the ""first"" real commodities shortage that made the news - lumber, a year ago.

[LBS](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) is currently near May ATH's. Keep this in mind.

* Now it's pretty obvious lumber shortages were due to [Wildfires on the west coast](https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html) (No ad [version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210202010056/https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/timber/why-is-there-a-lumber-shortage-in-the-u-s/article_70382602-54fc-11eb-a16b-934c0ae1c18f.html)), wiping out wood supply at the source.

* Or is it? Lumber shortages were actually because of [COVID-19 restrictions](https://fortune.com/2021/03/20/lumber-prices-2021-chart-when-will-wood-shortage-end-price-of-lumber-go-down-home-sales-cost-update-march/) at the sawmills, without a doubt. Sawmills are working at reduced capacity - we should see declining profits for these folks.

* Actually, it's due to the [mountain pine beetle](https://web.archive.org/web/20210702170646/https://qz.com/), which infested BC forests, causing massive effects of damage and causing forests to need to regrow.

* No, really. It's actually not a supply-side issue at all - lumber prices got here through [massive demand coming from people creating at-home workspaces](https://www.probuilder.com/blog/look-lumber-prices-supply-side) and moving out to rural areas.

* That's nonsense, obviously. The real contributor is [US tariffs on wood import from Canada](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519002332/https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-home-prices-soaring-11617834557), which has been plaguing us for years.

* But these reasons are all wrong, of course. The *real* reason there's a shortage is because of [chemical shortages](https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/chemical-shortages-limited-freight-capacities-reduce-wood-adhesive) from Texas winter storms leading to a [shortage of resin](https://wjactv.com/news/local/lumber-prices-skyrocket-as-shortage-continues), which is integral for plywood.

* Ha - fooled ya. It's nothing to do with lumber production, it's actually all [transportation related](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2021/05/lumber-shortage/).

### Why should I care?

Even if you're not personally invested in lumber, there is a really concerning reason to care about it.

The vibe you should get above isn't ""gee, that must have been a perfect storm."" It's that no one actually knows what the hell is going on, and why we're basically back to ATH's a year after the ""shortage"" has been resolved.

Articles will look for a plausible reason, latch onto it, and feed it to you as if it's obvious. The above should make it abundantly clear that there was **no** consensus or transparency into why lumber evaporated for months on end.

While sawmills were working at ""reduced capacity"", the combined net profits of the five largest publicly traded North American lumber producers (Canfor in British Columbia; Interfor in British Columbia; Resolute Forest Products in Montreal; West Fraser Timber in British Columbia; and Seattle-based Weyerhaeuser) somehow...

Berkshire repurchased more than $4.6 billion of its Class B stock and about $486.6 million in Class A shares.

>The share repurchase is the most ever in a single period for Buffett, nearly double the $2.2 billion the conglomerate bought back in the final quarter of 2019. In fact, the amount is slightly more than what Buffett spent buying back Berkshire stock in all of 2019. Despite the company’s record buybacks last quarter, the Berkshire’s cash hoard grew to more than $140 billion.

>Operating profits for Berkshire fell 10% during the second quarter, dropping to $5.51 billion from $6.14 billion in the year-earlier period. The company also took a charge of approximately $10 billion from Precision Castparts, Berkshire’s largest business within its manufacturing segment.

>Berkshire’s investments in public markets gained $34.5 billion in the quarter. That gain caused overall second-quarter net earnings to surge to $26.3 billion, up from $14.1 billion a year ago. However, unrealized gains from investments quarter to quarter are volatile and Buffett himself warns investors not to focus on that overall net earnings figure.

I'll try to quote some relevant sections from the NYT article:

> “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.  Mr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic’s effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

> “Firms intend to hire these people back,” Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

>In this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.  Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

\- Late Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank surprised the market by announcing it needed to raise $2.5 billion in stock. The bank had been forced to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.8 billion loss as its startup clients withdrew deposits, it said.

\- It's reported Friday morning that the efforts to raise capital had failed and that SVB had pivoted toward a potential sale.

\- SVB failed on Friday after it couldn't find a buyer, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. taking over its assets and liabilities

qnvzaw,investing,Congress passes $1.2T infrastructure bill,"Congress has passed a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, delivering on a major pillar of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda after months of internal deliberations and painstaking divisions among Democrats.

The final vote was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats in support of the bill, though six Democrats voted against it.
The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, following hours of delayes and internal debating among Democrats on Friday, including calls from Biden to persuade skeptical progressive members of the Democratic caucus.
The legislation passed the Senate in August, but was stalled in the House as Democrats tried to negotiate a deal on a separate $1.9 trillion economic package, another key component of Biden's agenda that many Democrats had tied to the fate of the infrastructure bill.
The legislation will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.
Biden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN. On the call, Pelosi thanked Biden for his help in getting the bill over the finish line as well.

**Edit:** From the Business Insider article: 

""One reason for this is that investor selling has been ""swamped"" by corporate buying, Fraser-Jenkins said. Global corporates have announced $820 billion in buybacks this year, which has exceeded selling by traditional investors. That's been supportive to the market as a whole, since when companies reduce their outstanding share count by repurchasing units, it lifts the per-share value of the remaining stock. In addition, companies have $1.3 trillion in pending mergers and acquisitions, which he says also supports the equity market. ""

> * Continuing claims, week ended February 20: 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week

> Initial jobless claims edged up only slightly after sinking far more than expected during the week ended February 20, though at least some of that drop appeared to have stemmed from data collection issues due to the extreme winter weather blanketing the country mid-month. Still, the stabilization below 750,000 suggested some underlying improvements in unemployment trends.

k3unr7,investing,TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

Disclaimer: I am long TSLA shares and call options. I am also long PLTR(long leaps too) and some other meme stocks which I am not mentioning cause my post gets removed somehow and I am not sure why(so you know I don't give a damn about valuations, although I am kind of an early mover, so all of them are at a very profitable position).",2020-11-30 12:10:56,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439763,1182 days 10:21:57.439763,775,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k3unr7/tsla_get_ready_to_cash_out_from_the_largest/

fl7863,investing,Bloomberg opinion: unemployment due to coronavirus could surpass Great Depression levels,"Article here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-18/coronavirus-recession-is-already-causing-staggering-job-losses?utm_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook 

The federal government is moving at a breakneck pace to respond to the coronavirus recession. In the states, however, the preliminary data suggests staggering job losses, exceeding economists’ expectations of just a week ago. If the pattern holds, it will mark the sharpest downturn in the labor market on record.

A spike in initial claims for unemployment insurance is among the earliest signs that a recession is underway. The most recent official number is from the first week of March, and it shows 221,000 claims, roughly on par with the average of the last several months.

State unemployment offices, however, are reporting huge increases in the volume of more recent claims. Hawaii reported 1,500 claims on Monday, five times the previous Monday. From Friday to Tuesday, Connecticut saw 30,000 claims, about 10 times the average for a whole week. Pennsylvania received a staggering 50,000 claims on Monday alone, compared to 12,000 claims for the first week of March.

All of this implies that, for the U.S. as whole, total initial claims for unemployment insurance for this week could spike to over 2 million. During the worst week of the Great Recession, the last week of March 2009, claims reached 665,000.

Some perspective: Even when the economy is booming, hundreds of thousands of workers file for unemployment benefits each week, and an even greater number find new jobs. In December 2007, by way of comparison, the U.S. economy added 108,000 jobs. In March 2009, it lost 800,000.

The correlation between unemployment insurance claims and the monthly payroll report is not exact. But simple extrapolation suggests that next month’s payroll report could show a total decline of roughly 4 million jobs. The human suffering behind that number is overwhelming. It all but requires Congress to pass without delay an increase the amount workers receive in unemployment insurance.

The macroeconomic consequences are if anything more dire. A typical recession gains steam because all workers reduce their spending: Some because they’ve lost their jobs, others because they expect to, others who are worried they might. This effect ripples through the economy.

The first month of major job losses during the Great Recession was February 2008, when the economy shed 906,000 jobs. The effect rippled throughout 2009, and during the entirety of the Great Recession about 8.5 million jobs were lost. A similar multiplier would place total job losses from the current recession at … 37 million.

Again, using back-of-the-envelope math, that implies a rise in the unemployment rate to about 27% — even higher than the 20% Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned as possible. It would exceed the highest unemployment on record, 24.9%, set during the Great Depression. To repeat: These are rough estimates based on early data.

Moreover, the coronavirus recession is, structurally speaking, unlike any that have come before it. Many of the measures the public is being asked to take are voluntary, so it is possible that economy could bounce back rapidly once they are lifted. On the other hand, because social distancing will have to continue for months, it could be that the initial shock is compounded several times over.

In either case, the government and the public should be prepared for a dramatic and uncertain economy.",2020-03-19 09:29:16,2024-02-25 22:32:53.439820,1438 days 13:03:37.439820,524,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fl7863/bloomberg_opinion_unemployment_due_to_coronavirus/

* Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. 

* ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.""

* Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy. Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.

* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. ""Walled gardens have existed for decades,"" she said. ""Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.""

* Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recommended a jury trial in the case in July. “It is important enough to understand what real people think,” she said. “Do these security issues concern people or not?” (in reference to Apple's argument that tight control over its App Store to keep customers’ data secure and private.)

* In the coming days, Gonzalez Rogers is expected to rule on a temporary injunction forcing Apple to allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic’s software development tools, in the interim.

(oops - title meant to say ""surge"", sorry)

* * *

U.S pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech said their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 among those without evidence of prior infection, according to data published Monday from their late-stage vaccine trial.

It comes as drugmakers and research centers around the world scramble to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in an attempt to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 1.25 million lives worldwide.

Scientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, while White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said one that is 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.

Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, hailed the development as a “great day for science and humanity.”

The results were based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted by an external and independent Data Monitoring Committee from the phase three clinical study. The independent group of experts oversee U.S. clinical trials to ensure the safety of participants.

The analysis evaluated 94 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial’s 43,538 participants. Pfizer and BioNTech said the case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received a placebo indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of above 90% at seven days after the second dose.

It means that protection from Covid-19 is achieved 28 days after the initial vaccination, which consists of a two-dose schedule.

The final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary, however, as safety and additional data continues to be collected.

“The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” Pfizer’s Bourla said in a statement.

“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,” Bourla continued.

“With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”

Roughly 42% of the trial’s participants had diverse backgrounds, Pfizer and BioNTech said, adding that there haven’t been any serious safety concerns reported yet.

The companies said they planned to submit for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration soon after they have two months of data, which is currently on track for the third week of November.

Based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The companies said they plan to submit data from the full phase three trial, which began on July 27, for scientific peer-review publication.

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

mwo3ha,investing,Some advice from a regular dude that will hopefully make you more money...,"Are you making stock purchases based on opinions from analysts, CNBC, stock pickers, and everything in between?

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

Sure, in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term?  No.  Here's a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10-20 years ago...

We live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood, acorns, or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor.  The result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy.  Coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors Millenials and Gen Z, do not own a home and/or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market.  What's interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions.  This seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint.  However, with the rise of 401(k) benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans, millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story.

We live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity.  The historic rise of ETFs approx +6,000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor.  Employers are increasing 401(k) benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits.  The rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like.

We live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search.  Trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor.  Things such as cloud computing, AI, Genomics, blockchain, green/renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren't going away anytime soon.  Access to social media, blogs, investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding.

Who knows what the next 10, 20, or even 50 years will bring?  I don't know but i'm certain that **change is here to stay** so stop worrying and embrace the unknown.

While I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think it's important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10-20 years.  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it.  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is, and always will be, the worst mistake you can make.  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest.

Who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10-50 years?  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it.  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that - heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls!

Edit 1:  Been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so I want to clarify a few things about what i'm tryna say here.

1.  I am not saying invest heavy into Technology/Clean energy or any of the other crazy shit that's been popping cause it will stay that way.  I am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 10-20 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology.  What will the next 50 years bring?  I don't know but i'm excited to find out.
2. I am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now.  You'd be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing we've been doing.  The M1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble.  Invest smart, look for value, average in, don't buy into the hype/FOMO, you'll be setting yourself up for some losses.
3. My post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money.  A lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now.  I am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market - look what we have done in the past 10-20 years as a nation and as a global population.  It's fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop.  Think long term always as a new investors, you're young and can handle losses.  I saw a comment on another thread saying ""take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest"" and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run.  Investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting.
4. Stop calling me stupid/naive it hurts my feelings lol.  I'm a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and I want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future.

Cheers!

mutq93,investing,Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand,"New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

jmfsrd,investing,Massive Wells Fargo layoff coming as soon as this Tuesday,"It has been reported that Wells Fargo is planning a massive layoff. Cutting up to 25% of its workforce, starting as soon as this coming Tuesday. Price of Wells Fargo shares have also hit lows not seen since 2009. The upcoming structuring might be what Wells Fargo needs in order to bounce back from its current lows.

Although Wells Fargo is probably one of the worst managed banks, other banks are also in similar situations. It is rumored that Bank of America is intentionally holding off their mass layoff until 2021.

l47jf5,investing,"Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis","**PLEASE DROP AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

hrwe84,investing,"Warren Buffet: ""If I had never sold a stock, I would be much wealthier""","See: https://youtu.be/MLgn_kVKjCE?t=1027

One of the biggest obstacles to active stock picking (as opposed to indexing) seems to be with all the problems with timing the market. We tend to want to buy when others want to buy, and less when others are fearful (i.e. the worst timing). 

But this strategy seems attractive. You pick high quality companies that you think will surge over the next 20 years (Amazon, Tesla, Disney, whatever you think) and NEVER SELL. 

This takes out some of the issues with active investing where people are getting in and out of the market at all the wrong times. 

What do you think? Would this solve any of the problems with active investing?

edit: lots of awesome comments but I think some people aren't being as charitable to the proposal as they should. Using examples of companies that rose and fall after 30 years isn't very fair to the main idea behind this proposal. Let's say buy and hold for 10 years minimum.

> Uber and Lyft each provide substantial discounts and incentives to riders, which subsidize the cost of trips and encourage usage. But they don’t account for these amounts in their sales numbers. Instead they categorize them as marketing expenses. That inflates reported gross profits and distorts common analyses of the companies’ unit economics.
>
> This distortion is possible because both companies inexplicably assert that their customers are not the passengers but the drivers...

And instead, passengers are called ""end-users"". These definitions allow them to adjust their sales:

> In 2018 Lyft included $338.4 million of rider incentives and refunds in “marketing expenses.” Had it been treated as ordinary sales discounts, reported revenue would have been some 16% lower than the $2.16 billion disclosed. The same year Uber reported that $1.4 billion in “sales and marketing” was for consumer discounts, promotions and refunds. If treated as ordinary sales discounts, sales would have been 12% lower than the $11.27 billion reported.

That move, which reduces the amount of money that banks have to keep in reserve, will unleash some 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) for business and household loans.
The decision — the second cut to that ratio this year — came on the same day China's Politburo signaled that it may take more aggressive actions to protect the economy in 2022. The Chinese Communist Party's leadership team, chaired by President Xi Jinping, said in a statement that ""ensuring stability"" would be a top priority in the coming year.",2021-12-08 08:30:53,2024-02-25 22:32:55.113678,809 days 14:02:02.113679,463,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rbmo7z/china_pumps_188_billion_into_the_economy_to/

> LONDON (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of financial data provider S&P Global Inc, said on Thursday that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, making it the latest major finance company to enter the nascent asset class.

> The S&P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&P’s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.

> “With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world’s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.

> Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.

> Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",2021-03-26 14:20:52,2024-02-25 22:32:55.113717,1066 days 08:12:03.113717,254,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mdppti/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/

**Revenue: $805.2 million vs. $810.7 million expected**

“We anticipated fiscal 2022 would be a very challenging year to forecast, given unusual year-ago comparisons, demand uncertainty amidst re-opening economies, and widely-reported supply chain constraints and commodity cost pressures,” Chief Executive Officer John Foley said in a letter to shareholders.

it7zdv,investing,Hindenburg: We View Nikola’s Response As a Tacit Admission of Securities Fraud,"Nikola Failed to Address 43 of our 53 Questions. Of Those It Touched On, It Largely Confirmed Our Findings or Raised New Questions.

Nikola Admitted That Its Deceptive “Nikola One in Motion” Video Was, In Fact, Video of The Semi-Truck Simply Rolling Down A Hill.

The Company Says It Never Claimed the Truck Was Powering Itself, Despite Deceptive Editing and Claims That it Had “1,000 HP” With “Sports Performance”

&#x200B;

In our report, we explained how the company released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be) called “Nikola One in Motion”, which made it seem that its Nikola One semi-truck was traveling under its own power at a high rate of speed. Angles in the video were edited to make it appear as though the semi was moving on a roadway that was flat, or even uphill.

In Monday’s response, the company acknowledged that its vehicle was not functioning under its own power, and instead, was apparently simply showcasing the power of gravity. It claimed that using the term “in motion” dispelled the deceptive nature of the video.

We disagree. Beyond common sense, the company referred to the Nikola One as “**the 1,000 HP**, zero-emission Nikola One semi-truck” in the description of its video. Obviously, the truck can’t have 1,000 horsepower or even 1 horsepower if it doesn’t power itself.

n93uwi,investing,CNBC: A psychedelic drug boom in mental health treatment comes closer to reality CMPS MNMD CLXPF ATAI by Eric Rosenbaum,"Mental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

m5kkxa,investing,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

so0xph,investing,"Peter Lynch: ""Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, than lost in the corrections themselves""","Wanted to bring back a fantastic quote from Peter Lynch during these turbulent times in the market. I recently have seen a lot of finance ""influencers"", as you would call it, and YouTubers attempting to time the market. It seems reasonable to do so, especially when the market has been wiggly and volatile in the past couple of months. 

But this quote from Peter Lynch is a fantastic reminder of why timing the market is obsolete. Human emotions are imperfect and trying to time the market is no better than a fool's errand. The better thing to do is to simply invest in businesses that you understand at a good price, and continue to DCA through the downturns. 

Making rash decisions such as choosing to sell everything based upon some hunch that you have is probably going to get you nowhere. 

Hope this helps.

After repeated delayed release and confirmed under-performance of EA's latest releases Star Wars: Battlefront II and Battlefield V, compounded with increasing likelihood of complete lootbox bans, which accounts for $1.3 bn of EA's annual earning, will be facing complete bans similar to what it has faced in Belgium.

w9lkwh,investing,Federal Reserve hikes interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.  


In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.  


While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.

More context:

https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/

>Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China's No.2 property developer Evergrande Group (3333.HK) were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

>Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing. read more

>Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country's financial system if the company's $305 billion of liabilities aren't contained.

>""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.

>Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

>On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

>Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

>""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

>But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

>Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

>Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

>In the debt market, Evergrande's Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.

>Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

>On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

>This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

Another (and the one that inspired me to actulay wtrite this) is someone complaining that the S&P is basicly the same as where it was in July of 2021 and wondering why there hasent been a 8% to 10% profit over that time.

Years where the return was exactly 8% to 10% : 1959 1965 2004 2016

When parsed this way, its fairly straightforward to see that when you add up all of the times it was under 8% and put that together with all the times it was over 10% that it balances out to 8%-10%. However, actually getting the 8% to 10% is a rare occurrence, happening only four times over the past century.

Four!

This is one of those counter intuitive things about stats. Kind of like how if a medical test is 99% accurate and your test is positive that does not mean you have a 99% chance of having the condition. Or like how it can be the case that for women medicine A is better than medicine B and for men medicine A is better than medicine B but together for the population as a whole medicine B is better than medicine A. Its just ""common sense"" that if an average is 8% to 10% then that should mean that 8% to 10% is the most common happening. But it does not work that way.

I know I am shouting into the void here. No matter what I say or do it is not going to stop the flow of people thinking that the S&P is a sure bet to return 8% to 10%. But I just had to say something to get it out of my system.",2022-02-18 23:29:58,2024-02-25 22:32:55.113942,736 days 23:02:57.113943,503,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/svvmau/the_paradox_that_the_stock_market_on_average_will/

mh6l6f,investing,Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clients,"Goldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Proposition 22 is unconstitutional as “it limits the power of a future Legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law”, which makes the entire ballot measure “unenforceable”, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch wrote in the ruling.

Gig economy companies including Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Instacart were pushing to keep drivers’ independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.

The ballot measure was meant to cement app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

Known as Proposition 22, it marked the culmination of years of legal and legislative wrangling over a business model that has introduced millions of people to the convenience of ordering food or a ride with the push of a button.",2021-08-21 02:49:23,2024-02-25 22:32:55.113973,918 days 19:43:32.113973,472,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p8jkgh/cnbc_california_superior_judge_on_late_friday/
11nuooj,investing,FDIC closes Silicon Valley Bank after bank fails to raise new capital,"Yahoo Finance: 

Troubled lender Silicon Valley Bank has been closed by the FDIC after deposit outflows and a failed capital raise sent the firm into crisis this week.

In a statement released late Friday morning, the FDIC said: ""Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. To protect insured depositors, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB). At the time of closing, the FDIC as receiver immediately transferred to the DINB all insured deposits of Silicon Valley Bank.""

Shares of the bank's parent company, SVB Financial (SIVB), remained halted for trade on Friday after having lost 60% on Thursday and another 60% in pre-market trading on Friday.

The FDIC's statement continued: ""All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds. As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors.""

vqljwe,investing,Meta is pulling the plug on its failed crypto project this September,"[https://fortune.com/2022/07/01/meta-novi-crypto-payments-wallet-end-september-2022/](https://fortune.com/2022/07/01/meta-novi-crypto-payments-wallet-end-september-2022/)

The remainder of the cryptocurrency project that Meta Platforms Inc.’s Founder Mark Zuckerberg took a beating over from Congress is officially shutting down. Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

vyt06k,investing,Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk’s Claims in Four Trial Days,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. wants a lightning-quick trial to resolve its claim that billionaire Elon Musk wrongfully canceled his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world’s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk’s Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn’t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter’s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Oh the irony lol.”

A judge hasn’t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter’s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter’s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn’t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.

“Litigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,” the lawyers wrote.

That would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don’t bet on it.

“I’d say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,” Elson said Wednesday in an interview. “There’s a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I’d say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.”

Last year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn’t force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.

>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

>The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

>Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvda/amd's surge to capture Intel market share?

mrhrgv,investing,Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders,"""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

---

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter",2021-03-16 22:15:20,2024-02-25 22:32:56.629716,1076 days 00:17:36.629717,274,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6kxvb/dd_ftft_a_400_million_chinese_scam/

Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 4.8 million in June and the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% as the U.S. continued its reopening from the coronavirus pandemic, the Labor Department said Thursday.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a 2.9 million increase and a jobless rate of 12.4%. The report was released a day earlier than usual due to the July Fourth U.S. holiday.

The numbers capture the move by all 50 states to get activity moving again after the virus seized up much of the U.S., particularly service-related industries.

However, because the government survey comes from the middle of the month, it does not account for the suspension or rollbacks in regions hit by a resurgence in coronavirus cases.

The unemployment rate also likely is understated due to counting errors at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers who still have jobs but have not been working are being counted as employed and even though as supposed to be considered unemployed under BLS rules.",2020-07-02 12:32:16,2024-02-25 22:32:56.629731,1333 days 10:00:40.629732,406,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hjw5o6/us_jobs_increase_by_48_million_in_june_vs_29/

mbjmdg,investing,Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|

|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

m1dxar,investing,"Spotify (SPOT) DD. Established company on the brink of profitability, trading at a low P/S relative to the industry.","Let’s get the elephant in Spotify’s room out of the way first, namely Apple Music. While Apple is a formidable competitor, they’re second in the race by a large margin: Spotify sits at 144M subscribers and Apple sits around 60M (likely closer to 70M by now). Despite the services being available in roughly the same number of countries (APM:167, Spotify:170), **Spotify’s been able to capture much more subscriber growth thanks to a few aggressive expansions.**

&#x200B;

You’ve definitely heard of Spotify’s aggressive podcast expansions, including JRE exclusivity and new originals/exclusives such as Michelle Obama’s podcast. This expansion led Spotify to **surpass Apple’s podcast numbers just barely in 2020, with analysts expecting 41% growth in 2021**. Analysts expect that 53.9% of ‘digital audio listeners’ will be podcast listeners in 2021. Spotify’s continuing to expand in this space to meet upstart competitor Clubhouse, by testing paid podcast subscriptions that allow for interactivity. (side note, I’d be interested to know if they’re trying to compete with twitch here too)

&#x200B;

A newer expansion on Spotify’s part is their recent foray into audiobooks. It appears that they’re sticking to public domain works for now to test the waters, but moving forwards, this could create a real challenge to competitors like Audible, a company with an estimated $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and no real competitors. 

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s been aggressively pursuing developing markets**, which has a negative impact on financials in the short term but could lead to greater profitability in the future.  The reason is that they charge lower rates in developing markets in order to build a subscriber base and a presence. 

&#x200B;

Onto some quick financial stats. (figures in EUR) 

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s 2020 revenue clocks in at 7.3B, and a 47.7B mkt cap, which works out to a P/S ratio of 6.53.** 

&#x200B;

Personally, I like to value companies in the context of competitors … which is sort of hard to do for spotify. I’d argue Netflix is the most comparable (software, digital media, subscriber model), and their P/S ratio sits at 8.96. Twitter’s a bit of a stretch, but their P/S ratio sits at 13.5: Adobe, another stretch but closer imo as it’s subscription-based software, sits at 15.9.

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s debt/equity ratio is on a downward trend, sitting at 1.26. It’s got a forwards CAGR of 22%.** 

&#x200B;

The biggest red flag I see on their balance sheet has to do with their **cost of revenue: it’s been increasing almost in lock-step with revenue. Spotify’s very close to being profitable, and they’ve posted a profit for some quarters (though never a full year).** Spotify’s under good management, however, and I’m confident that once their more aggressive expansions mature, profit will follow, especially as they’ve proved they can stave off competitors like Apple. 

&#x200B;

On a valuation play alone, I’d argue Spotify is better suited to a **P/S of at least NFLX,** which would place it at **$375/sh**. With growth taken into account -- that the firm is estimated to grow at 22%, and is well-positioned globally against competitors -- I’d argue a more accurate P/S would place it **closer to 10 P/S**, putting SPOT at **$418/sh**. ^((these P/S ratios are gargantuan, but that’s true for the tech sector in general; my argument is that spotify’s undervalued in the context of the current market.))

&#x200B;

I don’t really do deep dives into companies this much, so let me know where I might’ve gone wrong in analyzing the company (especially if I missed something in the balance sheet).

Very good point that’s been raised by a few comments: Industry structure, namely big labels, might prevent Spotify from improving their margins enough to post profits. This is absolutely a risk, and one that Spotify could overcome in a variety of ways, all involving increased vertical integration. It’s also possible that this is less of a problem than it seems: I’d argue Spotify’s leverage isn’t insignificant, and that they may be able to keep contracts with major labels at current rates.",2021-03-09 19:18:56,2024-02-25 22:32:56.629793,1083 days 03:14:00.629793,473,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1dxar/spotify_spot_dd_established_company_on_the_brink/

11vr7km,investing,UBS agrees to buy Credit Sussie for over $2bln - 75% haircut from Friday’s Market Cap,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crunch-time-credit-suisse-talks-033651935.html

UBS has agreed to buy Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2 billion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, as authorities bid to stave off turmoil when the markets reopen.

Officials have been racing to rescue the 167-year-old bank, among the world's largest wealth managers, after a brutal week that saw the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. As one of 30 global banks seen as systemically important, any deal for Credit Suisse could ripple through global financial markets.

At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion possibly spreading in the region's banking sector and looking to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to step in with stronger signals of support, two senior executives with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

A person with knowledge of the talks earlier told Reuters that UBS sought $6 billion from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

One source previously said the talks were encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combined. The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Sunday called for the immediate creation of a task force to deal with the risk to jobs.

Swiss broadcaster SRF and other media reported that the government would hold an ""important"" press conference later on Sunday. They did not give any more details.

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.",2023-03-19 17:22:24,2024-02-25 22:32:56.629839,343 days 05:10:32.629840,304,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11vr7km/ubs_agrees_to_buy_credit_sussie_for_over_2bln_75/

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood isn't betting on Uber Technologies Inc UBER, -1.55% and LYFT Inc LYFT, -2.42% over Tesla Inc TSLA, +2.44%.

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

Data collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.

ks3xo6,investing,TSLA - Tesla market value today is more valuable than all the world's major auto makers combined - what gives?,"Tesla market value today (716 Billion) is about the same as  the market value of all the world's major car makers combined.  In addition China's BYDDY (86B) and Nio (78B) are both more valuable than Daimler (74B) even though NIO only delivered less than 40,000 cars in all of 2020 with huge loss. China's LI and XPEV combined market value are similar to GM (61B), which has production in China and has a worldwide lineup of EV to be on the market in the next few years.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

fijg32,investing,S&P 500: The shortest bear market in history lasted 3 months. The longest lasted more than five years. The average lasts 14 months.,"For those of you so eager to buy back in, it would be good to get educated on what a bear market actually is. It's not just a term for stocks going down or a particularly deep dip to buy. 

Bear markets act a certain way, last a certain amount of time and certainly don't magically reset back into the last bull market we had. There will be a new bull market (at some point) but it likely will be very different from the nature of the one that is now dead and buried that we all loved so much from 2009 - 2020. Expect different market leadership, different return patterns and certainly a different duration. 

The good news is that typically the sharper the drop into bear market territory, the quicker the recovery is.

> California Attorney General Xavier Becerra requested the injunction as part of a lawsuit he brought in May along with city attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleged Uber and Lyft violated the state’s new law known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which was created as a way to classify gig workers as full employees and ensure benefits from their employers. Uber and Lyft were among a group of tech companies that have previously opposed the bill, arguing their workers enjoy the flexibility of creating their own schedules as contractors.

Our state and workers shouldn’t have to foot the bill when big businesses try to skip out on their responsibilities. We’re going to keep working to make sure Uber and Lyft play by the rules.”

>

u4ht6s,investing,Twitter board adopts ‘poison pill’ after Musk’s $43 billion bid to buy company,"**Note:** The term poison pill refers to a defense strategy used by a target firm to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover by an acquiring company. Potential targets use this tactic in order to make them look less attractive to the potential acquirer: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp

**Article:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/twitter-board-adopts-poison-pill-after-musks-43-billion-offer-to-buy-company.html

Twitter adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a “poison pill,” a day after billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy the company for $43 billion, the company announced Friday.

The board voted unanimously to adopt the plan.

Under the new structure, if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of at least 15% of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s approval, other shareholders will be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.

The plan is set to expire on April 14, 2023.

Such a move is a common way to fend off a potential hostile takeover by diluting the stake of the entity eying the takeover.

“The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,” the company said in a press release.

Twitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.

Musk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter’s CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board. But days later, Musk reversed course and decided not to join the board after all.

If he had joined, Musk would not be allowed to accumulate more than 14.9% of beneficial ownership of the company’s outstanding common stock.

Also on Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources, that Twitter brought on JPMorgan to help respond to Musk’s bid. Twitter had already been working with Goldman Sachs and Musk has been working with Morgan Stanley.

Several outlets including The New York Post reported Twitter was also fielding interest from Thoma Bravo, though it’s still uncertain a bid will materialize, according to sources who spoke to Reuters.

JPMorgan has history with Musk, suing Tesla over a matter related to his 2018 tweet claiming he had “funding secured” to take the company private. Tesla later countersued the bank.

JPMorgan, Twitter and Thoma Bravo declined comment.

In a live-streamed interview at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver on Thursday, Musk laid out his vision for making Twitter’s algorithms more publicly accessible and limiting content moderation.

He also acknowledged he’s “not sure” if he’ll actually be able to buy Twitter, though he said he does have “sufficient assets” to fund the deal if accepted. Despite his fortune, Musk has much of his assets tied up in equity in his companies including Tesla, meaning he’d likely have to liquidate or borrow against his assets to come up with a large sum.

But Musk said “there is” a Plan B if his initial offer to buy the company and take it private, which he called his “best and final,” is rejected. He declined to provide further details in the TED interview.

On Friday, Twitter’s former CEO and current board member Jack Dorsey tweeted that “the real issue” is that “as a public company, twitter has always been ‘for sale.’”",2022-04-15 21:05:42,2024-02-25 22:32:56.629913,681 days 01:27:14.629913,231,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u4ht6s/twitter_board_adopts_poison_pill_after_musks_43/

j6tb9e,investing,Barclays says 15-17% of US malls may need to be redeveloped into other uses,"Barclays: 

""**The COVID-19 pandemic has likely accelerated a long-expected rationalization of retail capacity in the US. Our modeling suggests that 15-17% of US malls may no longer be viable as shopping centers and need to be redeveloped into other uses.** While that is a big number, it is lower than the share of loans that are currently in default in the sector (about one third are delinquent, based on CMBS data). With e-commerce having taken a large chunk of market share, and social distancing reducing foot traffic, 2020 has seen a record number of store closures. Street-front retail will also suffer high vacancies and corresponding rent cuts, but should be a better-performing asset because it does not have the same tipping-point risk that malls bear once a certain volume of stores are vacant.""

""**For failing malls, many of the most likely redevelopment options – conversion to residential or warehouses – could result in valuations falling 60-90% compared to preCOVID appraisals.** While the land that has housed malls may offer better recovery values if used for mixed-use developments, historically that has only happened for about 15% of former malls (and those at a time when a very small number of malls required redevelopment at any moment).""

""**In Europe, the situation is less dire due to a relatively small per-capita retail footprint**. So, while we expect some re-rating of rents, a large jump in malls that require redevelopment seems unlikely.""

""**The bright spot is warehouses, where Amazon might need to triple its end-2019 footprint just to efficiently operate its current business.** And of course, Amazon is only one of a multitude of e-commerce players. However, such growth is unlikely to provide a backstop for malls, due to issues around zoning and building suitability, a limited need for new warehouses compared to the amount of mall space that may need to be retired, and the lower average rents for warehouses compared to performing retail.""

ii8wsu,investing,"With MSFT, AAPL AMZN, GOOGL and FB making up more than 1/5 of the S&P500, what are practical ways to de-risk your portfolio from this imbalance?","For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.

$AMZN is currently up 18% in AH.

Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter results on Thursday and announced it will raise its Prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119 in the U.S. The stock is soaring in after-hours.

These are the top- and bottom-line results for Amazon's fourth quarter.

Earnings per share: $27.75

Revenue: $137.4 billion

This is the third time since the launch of Amazon Prime that the e-commerce giant raises prices for its yearly delivery service in the U.S. It hiked fees in 2014 and 2018 by $20 each time. The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.

The company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.

""Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,"" said the company's earnings statement.

Net sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.

Amazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.

The company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.

j7p1ta,investing,The US debt is now projected to be larger than the US economy," 

As the United States continues its struggle with the pandemic-induced economic recession and a [sputtering recovery](https://www.cnn.com/business/economy), the country's burgeoning debt is not anyone's top concern these days.

&#x200B;

Even deficit hawks are urging a dysfunctional Washington and a chaotic White House to approve another round of [badly needed stimulus](http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/stimulus-pelosi-trump-coronavirus/index.html) to the tune of trillions.

&#x200B;

""The US federal budget is on an unsustainable path, has been for some time,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome [Powell said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/economy/fed-powell-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html) this week. But, Powell added, ""This is not the time to give priority to those concerns.""

&#x200B;

However, when the country eventually pulls out of its current health and economic crises, Americans will be left with a debt hangover.

&#x200B;

On Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that for fiscal year 2020, which ended September 30, the US deficit hit $3.13 trillion -- or 15.2% of GDP -- thanks to the chasm between what the country spent ($6.55 trillion) and what it took in ($3.42 trillion) for the year.

&#x200B;

As a share of the economy, the estimated 2020 deficit is more than triple what the annual deficit was in 2019. And it's the highest it has been since just after World War II.

&#x200B;

The reason for the huge year-over-year jump is simple: Starting this spring, the federal government spent [more than $4 trillion](https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/) to help stem the economic pain to workers and businesses caused by sudden and widespread business shutdowns. And most people agree more money will need to be spent until the White House manages to get the Covid-19 crisis under control.

&#x200B;

The Treasury Department won't put out final numbers for fiscal year 2020 until later this month. But if the CBO's estimates are on the mark, the country's total debt owed to investors -- which is essentially the sum of annual deficits that have accrued over the years -- will have outpaced the size of the economy, coming in at nearly 102% of GDP, according to calculations from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

&#x200B;

The debt hasn't been that high since 1946, when the federal debt was 106.1% of GDP.""Debt is the size of the economy today, and soon it will be larger than any time in history,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas said.

&#x200B;

The problem with such high debt levels going forward is that they will increasingly constrain what the government can do to meet the country's needs.

&#x200B;

Spending is projected to continue rising and is far outpacing revenue. And interest payments alone on the debt -- even if rates remain low -- will consume an ever-growing share of tax dollars.

&#x200B;

Given the risks of future disruptions, like a pandemic, a debt load that already is outpacing economic growth puts the country at greater risk of a fiscal crisis, which in turn would require sharp cuts to the services and benefits on which Americans rely.

&#x200B;

o93fz5,investing,People who say “value investing” is dead are idiots,"Value investing, at its core, is essentially buying great businesses at prices lower than their intrinsic value. Combine good analysis of intangibles, and you can find some really good plays. I feel, however, people have chosen to ignore the potential of lower priced, lesser known companies for companies trading well over their intrinsic values. Apple was trading at around 100$ in the early 2000’s, and the fundamentals made sense for a buy back then, but people didn’t buy it until it became mainstream. There are still many companies TILL THIS DAY that have amazing fundamentals, are in up and coming industries, and also have competitors doing decently well. If you can find these companies and hold on to them, then how is value investing dead? Is it easy to find the next Microsoft or Johnson and Johnson? No. It wasn’t easy in 1995, it wasn’t easy in 1965, and it’s not gonna be easy in 2021. But the notion that value investing is some how less effective would mean that fundamentals don’t matter long term. I think that’s a very dangerous narrative to push. If you’re not betting on a companies fundamentals for the long term, then what are you betting on exactly?

These fabulously rich Americans, whose ranks have more than doubled since the depths of the Great Recession, are younger than less wealthy millionaires. 
The average age of those with at least a mere $1 million is 62, a number that hasn’t budged in years.


About 172,000 U.S. households have net worths of at least $25 million, Spectrem estimated last year. That’s up from 84,000 in 2008.


About nine in ten investors under 38 attributed their success to “inheritance” and “family connections” in the Spectrem survey. But the same proportion also said “hard work” and “running my own business” played a role. 
About 70 percent of the richest investors said they’re still working.

vp5yxc,investing,BofA analyst sees Tesla market share of EVs falling from 70% to 11% by 2025,"https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-general-motors-ford-shares-analysis-car-wars/

>Tesla has held about 70 percent of the EV market share in recent years. That is forecast to drop to a mere 11 percent over the next four years, says John Murphy, the Bank of America analyst behind the annual Car Wars report that looks at the auto industry and predicts which companies are on a winning path and which are not.

>Musk's apparent idea that the supposedly unsophisticated auto industry didn't know how to manufacture came back to bite him when he learned firsthand how hard it is to make cars, learned that those legacy techniques work, and was forced to adopt them. ""That was a big miss on his part,"" Murphy says.

I have said before that I won't touch Tesla stock either way, because underestimating has proven a mistake, even in the face of obvious headwinds... but other manufacturers are releasing _135 EV models_ over the coming years, so something is going to stick. We've already seen demand exceeding supply for the F150 and Mach E.

>""He is launching new product at a slower rate, he does not have a full product portfolio, so there is a huge opportunity for other competitors to shoot the gap and catch up,""

Tesla does not have a real SUV, they have hatchbacks. There is a huge market miss there. They don't have a truck, and that is a _huge_ moneymaker for auto manufacturers. They don't have anything compact or ""cheap.""

It's important to note after all of this that the share of cars being EV is increasing, so even with falling market share expect their production to increase. But I don't think it's going to be 90% of the market as some Tesla bulls predict.

Tesla's EV market share in Europe declined from 31% in 2019 to 13% in 2020. Last month it was 10% market share.

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

In an attempt to contain raging inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. And it’s going to keep on raising them till something breaks, says John Stepek. The **“Fed put”** is dead. Or at least, the stock market level at which the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, will intervene with the soothing balm of looser monetary policy, has been lowered substantially. That much is very very clear. If anyone had any doubts, yesterday’s monetary policy decision should have set them right. The Federal Reserve isn’t playing games anymore. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point. It’s now targeting a Federal Funds rate of 1.5-1.75%. When you think about how unthinkable that would have been just a year ago, it’s staggering.

c5vo2c,investing,A buy and hold approach for 24 years,"As a conservative growth dividend growth investor, I wanted to do a short study on what buying and holding 25 well known blue chips would have done for an investor over the course of approximately 24 years. We’re making the following assumptions.

* The Investor is not an expert, but has a basic understanding of how to evaluate a stock.
* They invested $1000 into each of the 25 companies in their portfolio.
* They refused to sell any of their holdings. Even when the tech bubble burst and during the housing crisis.
* We will stick to American blue chips that have been around for at least 15-20 years and pay a dividend. This excludes tech stocks from our portfolio. (You can try replacing one of the companies with IBM if you’d like.)
* Emphasis will be on companies that the investor has experience dealing with in their day to day lives. So the portfolio will be skewed towards consumer staples and retail a bit.
* All dividends have been reinvested as soon as they were paid out.
* Any special dividends and spinoffs were sold and the cash proceeds were reinvested into the parent company.
* We’ll include 3 famous former blue chips that have gone bankrupt. Any spinoffs and dividends were reinvested into the company that went bankrupt. Feel free to include a company of your choice (Sears, Toys R Us, Eastman Kodak etc).
* For simplicity’s sake, I haven’t included companies that got acquired or taken private.

I’ll be using this calculator [https://www.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator/](https://www.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator/) with a starting date of Aug 1 1995 (as far back as the calculator goes) to the present day. Please feel free to point out any inaccuracies.

SPY has a CAGR of **8.97%**  (with dividend reinvestment) over the last 24 years. A $25,000 in SPY on 08/01/1995 would be worth **$196,475** today.

Our portfolio of 25 stocks has a CAGR of **11.77%** and a present value of **$361,178**.

Picking our 6 biggest winners and assuming the other 19 go bankrupt would be in line with market performance with a present value of **$198,329**.

Some thoughts for those who would like to build a similar portfolio

Look for companies that

* Have a business model that you understand properly.
* Consistently generate excess returns on invested capital compared to the market as a whole.
* Companies that maintain a clean balance sheet. Metrics to look at would be NetDebt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity and Interest Coverage ratio.
* Many boring consumer staples have historically outperformed the market because they grow earnings reliably and tend not to be overpriced in general.

Buy said companies when

* They are trading at a discount compared to historic levels. Metrics to look at would be EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, FCF yield.
* However, avoid buying companies that have heavily compromised their balance sheet. If the free cash flow barely covers the dividend, stay away. If the interest coverage ratio is in the low single digits, stay away.
* Avoid buying overpriced stocks. Even the best companies will offer subpar returns when you overpay. KO has slightly underperformed the market because it was trading at a PE in the 50s during its peak in the late 90s.

You can get all this information from Morningstar or Value Line that most public libraries provide free access to. Or you can calculate it from the sec filings [https://www.sec.gov/](https://www.sec.gov/).

Keeping this in mind will keep you from panic selling when the market sees a downturn. In fact, it’ll even help you buy excellent companies at a nice discount. **This isn't a guarantee to outperform the market, but it's a fairly straightforward approach that increases your odds of doing so**.

&#x200B;

EDIT: To people who feel like it's easy to pick a winning portfolio in hindsight are missing the point. I'm trying to show you can build a winning portfolio from large cap blue chips without taking on unnecessary risks. The worst a company can do is go to zero. At best, the sky is the limit. You can try replacing the big winners (MO, BF.A, CHD) with a few more bankruptcies or try other names such as TGT, CPB, CLX etc and see how the portfolio performs. You probably won't be able to repeat Lynch or Buffet's performances, but a couple of hundred basis points is realistic in the long run.

For people asking why I chose the stocks I did, a professor from Wharton picked the top companies from the late 50s to see what types of companies provided the best returns. Over the past 50 years, consumer staples were some of the best performers because

1. They are generally not very capital intensive.
2. Their earnings are the least cyclical
3. Consumer staples generally trade at a lower valuations because they have lower earnings growth. This often translates to lower price to earnings growth ratios. MO and PM are two such stocks that fit that criteria today. GIS below $45 a share would also fall into that category.

o7nkbu,investing,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns SP500(1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-a-market-correction-coming/) 

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

lk688l,investing,Is now the time to jump ship? 50% of NYSE/NASDAQ equities posted a TTM EPS <0,"So I was listening to an interview with Howard Marks & Joel Greenblatt, called ""Is It Different This Time?"" (google it if you haven't, its fantastic) and one of  Joel's talking points about the euphoria we've reached in the stock markets is that:

* He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)
* As of early 2021 all 100 companies have posted a 100% return
   * (Share price at end of 2019 -  Share price End of January 2021) / (Share price at end of 2019)

I thought that statement was bonkers, so I took a list of NYSE + NASDAQ companies \~ 6500, excluded SPACs/warrants and anything that through an error in google sheets (lazy I know), which left around 5000 equities.

&#x200B;

* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a >100% return from their 52 week low
* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 500 have posted a >500% return from their 52 week low

So I try to rationalize these as buying opportunities as a result from COVID but when I filter the 5,000 equities to only include companies w/ a TTM EPS of <0, I am left with 2,500\*\*.\*\*

**2,500 unprofitable publicly traded companies.**

So 2,500, or \~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS <0).

What blows my mind is of these 2,500 ""unprofitable companies"" :

# 1,795 have had a >100% return from their 52 week low

# 500 of the  have had a >50% return YTD

WTF?

* 50% of all publicly traded NASDAQ/NYSE companies are not profitable
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Result = 2500
* Yet 35% have posted a 100% return from their 52 week low
   * Filter 1  = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 +  only list equities where ((current price - 52weeklow)/52weeklow) > 100% )
   * Result = 1795
* And  10% have had a **2021 YEAR TO DATE RETURN OF > 50%**
   * Filter 1  = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 + only list equities where ( (currentprice - price on 1/1/21) / price on 1/1/21 ) > 50%)
   * Result = 500

&#x200B;

I mean guys, do this yourself if you don't believe me - it's literally 5 GOOGLEFINANCE functions a bunch of pivot tables in excel.

What I dont have is a relative basis for comparison, e.g if these numbers are normal in a pre-covid environment, e.g. 5 years ago, 10 years ago, etc.

I mean I love a good rally, and i'm definitely in some risky small caps but when I see companies like SOUTHWEST AIRLINES posting negative quarter-over-quarter earnings, **yet its trading back at pre-pandemic levels** I have come to one of two conclusions:

&#x200B;

1. **My math is wrong and I am in a moron**
2. There will be a ""major correction""  in 2021

I would love to get feedback from the community at large, especially from the contrarians and old timers. Also, if one were to ""capitalize on a major correction in the next 12 months"" what would you recommend? Buy VIX?

153uopg,investing,Yesterday I officially hit $100k invested in 401k at 29 years old.,"Just wanted to share to demonstrate to the newer investors that consistent contributions paired with a strategy that you are confident in will pay you back over time.

Since i joined the work force in 2016, my 401k was mostly in target dates funds, and company stock, getting miniscule returns. Additionally i messed around a few times with a few thousand doing my own stock picking in a brokerage account (almost exclusively losing money).

At the end of 2021 i backed off from the brokerage account, and moved 100% of my 401k into an SP500 tracker. During this time i was contributing 10% of my salary ($101,000) with a 5% employer match. Even with the turbulent market the past year and a half, this was by far my best investment decision ever, other than buying my house in 2019.

I plan to continue this strategy for the next 15 years or more. My only question is when do i start moving money into a less volatile investment product as i approach retirement?

17yaktc,investing,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",2023-11-18 16:51:37,2024-02-25 22:32:56.630371,99 days 05:41:19.630371,291,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17yaktc/7_years_from_0_to_100k_3_years_from_100k_to_200k/

fggids,investing,"Options Basics: Intro to Puts, Calls, and the Volatility of the Underlying Asset","**Before You Read:** This is part of an ongoing series on the basics of options trading and valuation, focusing on stock options. This is the second post in the series. You do not need to read the first part for this part to make sense, but if you are not familiar with the concept of equity, you may find it helpful.

The first post, which goes over the concept of equity, can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)

This post will explain what put and call options are. From there, it will delve into our first valuation and trading concept, which has to do with volatility as the title suggests. There is an opportunity to apply your knowledge at the end.

This is a bit of a long post because it introduces a lot of new concepts. I will try to make subsequent posts shorter. I suggest taking a break and coming back to this post later if you start to get tired or confused. You can take this in bites, so no need to swallow it like a snake.

**Puts and Calls**

**A put is the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset for a specific price.** The asset the put holder has a right to sell is called the **“underlying.”** The price at which the put option allows the option holder to sell is called the **“strike.”** Put options have an **expiration date**, after which they cannot be exercised, which is to say you owner of the put option can no longer invoke their right to sell after the option has expired. Now, let’s put it all together into once sentence: **When a person trades a put option, they are trading the right to sell the underlying at the strike price, subject to the eventual expiration.** 

That sounds great, but how could the right to sell something at a certain price be valuable? At this point, you need to have a notion of what “market price” means. Let’s review for a moment before we dive in, using stocks as an example. When you trade a stock, you buy or sell that stock based on an agreed upon price. Traders can bid (offer to purchase) or “ask” (offer to sell) a stock at any price, but only when one trader’s bid to buy is higher than another trader’s ask to sell does a trade actually occur. That point of overlap is called the “market price.” In reality, the bid involved will end up being slightly higher than the ask, and a series of financial institutions ultimately make their money by pocketing the difference, but for our purposes, we’ll say that the market price is just where bids and asks collide. For our purposes, we may also refer to the market price as the “spot price” for now. Either term is fine for the moment.

**Puts have value because the strike price of a put may be different than the market price of the underlying.** For example, if you own a put with a strike of $5, and the underlying has a market price of $3, you have the right to buy the underlying for $3, and then turn around and exercise that put to sell the underlying to collect $5, ultimately making $2 of profit. That $2 is called the “intrinsic value” of the put option. **The intrinsic value of an option is how much you could theoretically profit at a given moment if you exercise it.**

Here is another way to look at intrinsic value: at the very moment when the option is just about to expire, and there is not enough time for the underlying price to change before expiration, the option would be worth $2. In other words, the option holder could theoretically sell their option and collect $2 instead of exercising it. Why an option holder might choose to sell rather than exercise an option will become clear as you read this series. What it comes down to is that the amount you can sell an option for may be greater than the amount you could stand to profit by exercising it. In other words, **an option may be worth more than its intrinsic value except at the exact moment of expiration**; just how is discussed later in this post.

For now though, it’s alright to be content with the notion that put options have value and that an option holder may choose to sell a put option rather than exercise it. Remember, the definition; a put is “the right, but *not* the obligation” to sell.

Now, let’s define call options, using what we have learned about puts: **A call option is the right, but not the obligation to buy (not sell) an underlying asset at a strike price, subject to expiration.** It should come as little surprise that call options also have value for reasons similar to put options. See for yourself. **Question 1:** if you had a call option with a strike of $5, and the underlying had a market price of $10, how much could you profit by exercising your call option to buy the underlying and then turning around and selling the underlying on the market? I’ll put the answer at the end of this post.

**Remember, calls let you buy at the strike. Puts let you sell at the strike.**

Like put options, call options can be traded, their intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price and the market price of the underlying, and they may be worth more than their intrinsic value except at the moment they expire. 

Let’s recap: puts are a right to sell, and calls are a right to buy. One good way to remember it is to imagine the underlying were a dog; if you call the dog, it will come to you. Puts and calls can both be exercised or traded. The option holder gets to decide if they want to exercise or trade, but the option can’t be exercised after it expires. Depending on the price of the underlying, exercising can lead to profits, and that possibility is why options have value.

We will now go over what can cause an option to trade for more than its intrinsic value. There are a few variables that can affect options valuation. We have mentioned two so far; 1) the strike price of the option and 2) the market price of the underlying. Volatility is the first one we will go over (later in this post) because it is the easiest to understand given only the strike and the spot. In future posts, we will go over the role of the time left until expiration and the role of prevailing interest rates; specifically something called the “riskless rate,” or “rf” for short. There are other variables that can be incorporated into options pricing models, but we will not address them until we have gone over at least two models that deal with these first five. 

To be clear, we are building up to being able to use 2 models that both incorporate five key variables, and you’ll be able to use 3 of the variables a simplified version of one of the two models by the end of this post. The key variables are, as previously stated:

1. The strike of the option, which we will call “K”

2. The market price of the underlying, which we will call “S.” S stands for “spot,” which for now we will just say is another name for the market price.

3. The volatility of the spot price

4. The time left until the option expires

5. The “riskless rate” briefly mentioned above

K and S determine intrinsic value. The other variables deal more with what we call “time value.”

**Intrinsic Value versus Time Value**

Let’s consider a call option with a strike of $8 (K=$8). Let’s say the market price or spot price is $9 (S = $9). If you were to exercise at that moment, you would make exactly $1 in profit (intrinsic value = $1 because $9 - $8 = $1). This uses the same logic we went over above. If you don’t get it, try doing Question 1, asking for help in the comments, or DMing me. 

But what if we knew that the price of the underlying (S) could change? For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume for now that S can change exactly once before expiration. We’ll also assume that, when S does change, it will change to either $6 (go down by $3) or $12 (go up by $3), and there is a 50% chance of each of those possible changes happening. Finally, we’ll assume that the change is about to occur this instant, so no time will pass before the single change, and the change will happen instantly. This is a lot to assume, but the assumptions will become less ridiculous as we are variables to our model.

If S goes to $12, intrinsic value would become $4 because $12 - $8 = $4. If S goes down to $6, the call is worth $0. Why is it not worth $-2? Remember, a call option is the right, but **not the obligation** to buy the underlying at the strike, so the option holder does not need to buy the underlying for $8 when the spot price is at $6; they can just decide not to exercise the option and let it expire worthless. 

Let’s recap: There is a 50% change the option will be worth $4 at expiration and a 50% chance it will be worth $0 at expiration. The option has $1 of intrinsic value right now. It also has what practitioners call “time value,” which is the value of the chance of the option having intrinsic value later. This time value is not to be confused with “the time value of money” which is a different concept. 

Let’s see how much time value this option has, starting with the single most important fact about option valuation: **The total value of an option is a function of its probability weighted future payoffs.** In this case, to find that total value, you multiply the value of each outcome by the likelihood it will happen. 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the total value of the option is $2. Subtract the intrinsic value of $1 from the total value, and you get $1 of time value. 

Before we do another example, this time with a put option, let’s quickly examine why it is worth breaking out the value of an option into intrinsic value versus time value. As I implied, **total option value = time value + intrinsic value**, and intrinsic value is S-K (spot – strike) for a call option and K-S (strike – spot) for a put option. You may recall I said that the one time an option’s total value is equal to its intrinsic value is at the moment of expiration because the underlying spot price has no time left to change. The implication here is that if total value approximates intrinsic value as the option nears expiration, then time value ultimately decreases to $0. Describing mathematically how the time value changes over time and eventually gets to $0 will require all five variables in either of our models – so that’s something to look forward to. For now, just be aware that this feature of options valuation exists. 

Let’s take the simplified model we have already used to value a call and apply it to value a put option. I’m going to start using the variables without restating what they mean at this point. You will want to be comfortable with them by the time we get to a full model.

Consider this put: K=7. S=10. The spot can either become $3 or $17 using the same assumptions about changes in the spot that we made for the call option valuation above. Let’s check out the total valuation first. If the price goes down to $3, it will be $4 below K, so intrinsic value would be $4. If the price of the stock goes up to $17, the intrinsic value of the option would be $0 because $17>$7. Now, let’s add it up: 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the option is worth $2. How much of that is intrinsic value? Well, S>K to start with, so the option starts with no intrinsic value. Therefore, all $2 are from time value. 

A little more terminology before we continue. **The relationship between a strike price and a spot price is called “moneyness.”** Remember how intrinsic value was $0 when the strike was below the spot for a put or above the spot for a call? **Intrinsic value cannot be negative, but moneyness can**. So a call with S = $3 and K = $5 would have a moneyness of $-2. If moneyness is positive, an option is said to be “in the money” or “ITM.” If you’re familiar with the musical *42nd Street*, you can remember this because being in the money is a very good thing. If moneyness is negative, the option is “out of the money”  
  or “OTM.” If moneyness is exactly $0, the option is “at the money” or “ATM.” This terminology will come in handy later when we start talking about actual trades. Let’s test our knowledge so far:

**Question 2:** An option has a moneyness of $-2 and S>K. Is it a call or a put? Answer shown at end of post. Can the option still be worth more than $0? How much of that value would be intrinsic value versus time value?

The relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value results in a special relationship between total option value and the spot price of the underlying.

Thank you for staying with me so far by the way. I know this is a lot.

**Volatility and Option Value**

You may have already noticed that an option’s intrinsic value can be expressed as a function of moneyness. Namely, if moneyness is at least 0, then intrinsic value = moneyness. This idea is powerful because it applies to both puts and calls. 

Now consider that if moneyness is not greater than 0, intrinsic value does not change as moneyness decreases further because it just stays at 0. In other words, whether moneyness is -3 or -10,000, intrinsic value is 0. However, if moneyness is at least 0, then as moneyness increases, intrinsic value increases as we stated before. If we put these two ideas together, we see that **the relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value is asymmetrical around 0. In other words, options have an asymmetric payoff function.**

Now let’s think of this in terms of volatility: all else being equal, a more volatile underlying asset price has more potential to cause an option to expire further in the money or further out of the money. Another way of saying this is that greater volatility leads to a greater chance of a higher absolute value of moneyness at expiration. Since intrinsic value can’t get any lower once it hits 0, higher volatility can raise the maximum intrinsic value an option can have at expiration up to infinity, but cannot lower the minimum intrinsic value below 0. So, under the model we have been using, if an option can already end up with $0 of intrinsic value, volatility can only help option value, not hurt it, from there. Later, when we get to the Black Scholes model, we will see that volatility is virtually always is accretive to total option value, but for now we will stick to easy examples where options have a high potential to expire OTM. 

For the purposes of an example, we’ll introduce one new term; σ (pronounced “sigma”). σ a parameter used to express volatility. Some readers may notice that σ is used to denote standard deviation in statistics. The idea is similar here. For this model, σ will denote the amount by which S can move up or down during the single change that occurs before option expiration. So if S is 0 to start with and can move to 4 or -4, then σ = 4. **Later on, we will express σ as a %, indicating a rate of change, but we are keeping it simple for now.**

Consider a call option with the following parameters using the model we have been using so far: K=25, S=20, σ=10. We know S can end up being either 30 (20+10) or 10 (20-10), which means the intrinsic value of the call will be either 5 (30-25) or 0 (because 10<25), which means that value of the option now is 2.5. 

Now let’s try decreasing sigma to 7. Now S can now be either 27 or 13 at expiration, which means intrinsic value is going to end up being either 2 or 0, which means the option’s value is 1. Notice how lowering σ decreased total option value. 

Now, let’s increase sigma dramatically to 15. S at expiration will either be 35 or 5, so intrinsic value at expiration with either be 10 or 0, which means the total value of the call option is 5. 

Feel free to try this with as many puts and calls as you want. You will observe that as long as the option isn’t so far in the money that S-σ>K for a call or S+ σ<K for a put, an increase in σ can never decrease option value, and as long as S has the potential to change such that the option may expire OTM or ATM, an increase in volatility will always increase total option value.

**Congratulations: you now understand the basic idea of how options prices relate to the volatility of the underlying asset, and you can express it using a simple options pricing model. (It’s a simplified version of the “binomial model” for readers that want to put a name on it.)** 

You may be wondering how markets determine volatility in the first place. When options trade on the market, the value that the options trade for can be used to determine the σ implied by the trade. For example, if we are using the model we’ve used above, a call option worth $3 where S starts at $5 and K is $4, must have an implied σ of $5. No other σ would produce that total option value. 

In the real world, the implied level of volatility is typically expressed as a % and refers to the standard deviation of the change in S over the course of a year. The model used to calculate implied volatility is typically the Black Scholes model, which we can easily learn once we are able to use all 5 variables in the binomial model. The implied value of σ given an option’s price based on the Black Scholes model is called Implied Volatility or “IV”. We will deal with IV more later. For now, just think of it as the market’s best guess at σ. 

The idea of IV does, however, bring up something we can use now; the IV of an option trading on the market is an estimation collectively arrived at by traders. **IV does not necessarily represent how much S will actually change because the market cannot psychically tell the future.** In other words, the market tries to calculate an appropriate value for σ, but often comes up with something that isn’t subsequently reflected in the actual behavior of the underlying. They get it “wrong,” in a way, and if you watch an option for a while, you’ll observe IV constantly changing. 

There is a way to try to make money from this theory: **If you think σ based on the actual future behavior of the stock will be too high or too low to justify the value at which an option currently trades, you may have a trading opportunity.** 

In that light, let’s do our first imaginary trade. To up the ante, **I’ll give gold to the first person who gets this right and posts the answer in the comments:** Let’s say you think the σ of an asset is going to be $10 based on the model we have used in the previous examples. You look at the option chain (the list of options available on the asset), and you see the options below. You decide you are going to buy one option. Which do you buy, and why?

S = $25

**Calls**

K = $35 Price = $1.00

K = $30 Price = $2.50

K = $25 Price = $3.50

K = $20 Price = $5.00

**Puts**

K = $30 Price = $3.50

K= $25 Price = $2.00

K = $20 Price = $1

K = $15 Price = $0.5

***Supplemental:*** 

***Bid Ask Spread:*** *The difference between the highest bid (offer to buy something) and the lowest ask (offer to sell something) is called the “bid ask spread.” The smaller the bid ask spread is, the more trades usually occur because small spreads imply there is less of a disagreement, measurable in price, between buyers and sellers. This small disagreement means only a small change in the bid or the ask is necessary to make a trade happen.* 

***To Whom Do You Buy or Sell When You Exercise an Option?*** *Ultimately, financial responsibility will fall on the person who wrote (originated or originally sold) the option, but your broker and a group called a “clearing house” are the ones who ensure that a transaction actually occurs when you exercise your option. The important thing to remember is that you do not take counter party risk from the person who wrote the option. That is to say, the person who wrote the option can’t simply refuse to honor their agreement and cheat you. If they try, you’ll still get to profit (to the extent appropriate) when you exercise your option because of the clearing house. The writer becomes their broker’s problem (and eventually law enforcement’s problem) – not yours. Keep an eye out for a post about “assignment” or look up “assignment and clearing houses,” for further reading.*

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs.

Investor Carl Icahn’s bet on the downfall of brick-and-mortar retailers produced a $1.3 billion gain during the first half of the year.

**1. Spend less than your cash flow.** Easy enough concept, and it is the number one rule.

**2. Pay yourself first.** When you get your paycheck, set money aside for yourself before any person or company you owe. This will determine whether you move up financially or not.

**3. Every dollar is an investment.** Even if you are going to Disneyland, it is an investment into your personal happiness and an investment into the relationships you are building with your companions. Every dollar you spend must be advancing you in some way. This will fight off instant gratification.

**4. Always expand your knowledge on making financial choices.** You have never learned everything you need to know. I don't care what school you went to. Keep reading, keep learning.

**5. Don't listen to false prophets.** Just as I encourage you to learn more, it is important to tune out of the advice of people who set bad examples. If your dad is 65 years old and still has not retired, you might want to think twice about following his instructions. Instead, listen to high-identity people.

**6. Set yourself up for financial security, don't have your job do it for you.** This is so important, and yet absolutely no one follows this rule. If you get a job, your employer will sit you down with HR, and an unqualified person from HR will give you deferred compensation options. This person is not licensed in financial options, and so cannot legally advise you. Choose your own retirement vehicles, because it is very likely you can hop employers.

**7. Shop for competing prices for everything and never buy anything at full price!** Clothes, car maintenance, insurance. If you are ever paying full price for a service, you are being exploited.

**8. Take care of yourself physically and legally.** Smoking will raise your life and health premiums. Getting a DUI will disqualify you from life insurance all together. This closes doors that can save you from being a slave till the end of your days.

**9.** **Your hourly earnings are important.** Your annual earnings are not. *Someone making $50,000 a year at $500 an hour has more of their time (meaning their life) than someone making $100,000 at $50 an hour.* This is the single most important concept in understanding who is rich and who is not. *Someone is not living an enriched life because they have amassed wealth and material possessions.* ***Someone is living an enriched life because they have the freedom to spend their time how they wish!***",2018-09-29 15:46:12,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222373,1975 days 06:46:46.222373,212,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9jxx8c/most_important_things_about_personal_finance_i/

inyom9,investing,"SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son’s bets on equity derivatives,"," 

[SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) shares tumbled in Tokyo trading after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.

SoftBank shares dropped as much as 5.4%, the most on an intraday basis since April. The stock had gained 33% this year before Monday.

The Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QG8ZJIMB2SJO) reported that SoftBank was making massive bets on technology stocks using equity derivatives. The FT labeled SoftBank the “Nasdaq whale” that “stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks,” though it didn’t include details of any trading. The FT later reported that SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son’s bets on equity derivatives, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.

 The Japanese conglomerate [said in August](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-returns-to-profit-after-record-losses-on-startup-bets) that it was starting a new unit to trade public securities, pushing beyond its traditional base in telecommunications and private startup investments. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-is-said-to-target-over-10-billion-in-public-investing) in August that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion, perhaps tens of billions, and would use financing structures that would allow the company to avoid showing up in public disclosures of shareholding. 

 

The Japanese company’s derivatives strategy has been built over the past few months, the FT cited the people as saying, adding that SoftBank has spent about $4 billion on options premiums focused on tech stocks over that time. SoftBank now has large but unrealized profits, and the trades have been deeply controversial even within SoftBank, the newspaper reported.

SoftBank declined to comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion buying call options on stocks, while also selling call options at higher prices.

 

The idea that options buyers [could drive extreme rallies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-04/option-traders-flex-market-muscles-with-focus-on-very-few-stocks) in technology stocks -- and push benchmark indexes to record highs -- would have drawn skepticism in the past. But as call volumes have exploded in stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc., analysts are beginning to embrace the theory. They point out that traders could have outsize influence by concentrating their bets on a narrow set of high-profile names while other trading activity is reduced.

“In a world where volumes are distorted by the frantic trading of algos, any real order flows may have surprisingly large impact on prices,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. “By trading options, they leverage their position.”

o1bkt6,investing,"Federal Reserve now expect to raise rates by the end of 2023, rather than hold them near zero.","https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials signaled they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March, as the economy recovers rapidly from the effects of the pandemic and inflation heats up.

Their median projection showed they anticipate lifting their benchmark rate to 0.6% from near zero by the end of 2023. In March they had expected to hold it steady through that year.
Prompting the policy shift is a much stronger economic rebound and hotter inflation than the Fed anticipated just a few months ago.

“Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid-19 in the United States,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting. “Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.”

In updated projections released Wednesday 13 of 18 officials indicated they expect to lift short-term rates by the end of 2023, up from seven who expected that outcome in March. In March, most of them anticipated holding rates steady through 2023.

The Fed has held overnight interest rates steady since March 2020, when the effects of the pandemic caused the sharpest economic contraction in generations. The central bank also has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds since June 2020 to hold down longer-term borrowing costs, providing further support to the recovery.

The Fed reiterated that it expects to continue bond purchases until “substantial further progress” has been made in the recovery.

Fed officials want the economy to get closer to their goals of “maximum employment” and sustained, 2% inflation before reducing the bond purchases. They have said they want to fully achieve those objectives before they raise interest rates.

Since officials’ previous meeting, in April, the labor market’s progress has been somewhat slower than they had anticipated. Employers added 837,000 jobs in April and May, leaving total employment 7.6 million jobs shy of pre-pandemic levels.

Policy makers have become less confident in recent weeks the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Some 2.6 million people retired between February 2020 and April, according to estimates from the Dallas Fed. A steadily aging U.S. population suggests limited scope for reversing that trend, some economists say.

In contrast, inflation has been higher than expected. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index rose 5% in May from a year earlier.

That inflation rate, the highest since 2008, makes the Fed uncomfortable, even if officials believe it reflects mostly temporary factors that should fade later this year. They worry that if inflation exceeds 2% too much or for too long, it might lead businesses and consumers to anticipate more inflation in the future, which can become self-fulfilling. Evidence of rising inflation expectations would likely require the Fed to tighten policy sooner or more aggressively than planned to re-anchor those expectations around 2%.",2021-06-16 18:20:45,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222423,984 days 04:12:13.222424,578,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/

* Today, FIZZ trades at 66% below its high in 2017, even though sales of sparkling water have increased 22% since 2017.
* Tyson, JBS, Nestle and other food companies are releasing their own plant-based meat products to compete with Beyond Meat.
* The larger companies can release their products cheaper. A Beyond Meat burger costs triple the cost of a regular burger. A Beyond Meat sausage is 70% more than regular sausage.

k1qvku,investing,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

>*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

>*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

>\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

>*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

lrl4qf,investing,Thoughts from my personal experience with Roblox over the past 15 years,"You can look at their books, but I believe it’s difficult to make an informed decision about $RBLX without some experience with the website and games themselves. Here are some of my thoughts from being an active member since 2007. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the platform.

Roblox has been available to the public since 2006; you’re not investing in a new up & coming company. It’s been around for 16 years, which is very long for an online game. That in itself is a good sign, but its potential and success is pretty cemented as of now. The lack of worldwide reach (with the majority of users being from North America) is worrisome, but there may be room for growth.

They are currently sitting at **2.4 billion** registered users. The daily active user (DAU) count is somewhere around **30 million** (see S-1 form in my edit).  Thus, the vast majority of registered users are inactive users or bots who prey on dumb kids to steal their account info via cookies. This is more of an anecdote than something you can really back up with hard numbers and data because it’s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for “free Robux” and such. There’s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it’s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter & number usernames. Their security and captcha, to summarize, sucks.

Roblox itself is a game client, but the website houses a variety of games made by users, of varying quality. There are some real gems but some real garbage as well. The front page cycles the same popular games and not a lot of up-and-coming ones. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to break into the algorithm if you’re not already a popular developer. Some people use/pay for bots to pump up their game’s likes and user count. This is obviously against the site's TOS, but it’s difficult to get ahead unless you pour hundreds into on-site ads.

Years ago, they shut down the forum, which contributed to a lot of helpful and insightful on-site discussion. They did so because they believed it was becoming difficult to moderate. Hire more moderators? That on top of the fact that the chat filter (both on-site and in-game) is becoming increasingly overbearing, it’s difficult to hold a conversation on the website, let alone form a tight-knit community. I feel a community is **essential** to the success of a social game platform like this one; right now, it feels like a soulless, barren corporate wasteland, compared to what it was before. Take a look at their [logo change](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Roblox-Logo-History.jpg), which summarizes the company’s new ethos well. There’s the argument that the chat filter needs to be overbearing because of the possibility of online predators - which is true - but there’s a difference between overbearing and broken. Sometimes, every second word is censored, even completely innocent ones.

Their customer support is pretty dismal. Not much else to say here, but I’ve personally dealt with it, and unless you are asking something really basic that can be answered by looking at the FAQ, they’re not much help. Just your typical outsourced copy & paste replies. When it comes to accidental moderation resulting in bans or account deletion, or account theft, they’re not very helpful. I’ve had an account made in 2010 deleted in 2016 for something I did not do (account theft; the account itself was stolen) and they were no help.

Years ago as well, the “free” currency Tickets were removed, leaving the premium one, Robux. Tickets were awarded on daily login and could be used to purchase cosmetics and such. Now, join any game and almost every avatar you see is the default one because the vast majority of kids aren’t paying for the premium membership which gives you monthly Robux, nor are they paying for Robux itself.

Thus, parent’s wallets are the limiting factor on how much Roblox can grow, because a lot of the older base such as myself shares the same sour sentiment regarding the website as a whole. Even newer users are seen calling for the “glory days” of Roblox to come back, which is odd since they themselves did not experience those “glory days”. That being said, the general community sentiment seems that not many people are happy with the site in its current state, which makes me wonder if it’s current young user base is sustainable or if Roblox depends on cycling generations of kids and isn’t really capable of building an older following in its current state.

Moving on, there’s a thriving black market for Robux and limited cosmetic items because of the aforementioned poor on-site economy. The cosmetics catalog used to have sales for holidays like Black Friday and Memorial Day. These are no longer a thing as of the last few years, which seems like a simple enough thing to do to keep Robux flowing in the economy, but they refuse to do so. (??)

Speaking of site-wide events, celebrations like a yearly Egg Hunt, events which were dear to many users, are no more. Instead, they are replaced with corporate promotional events. These don’t yield independent games made by Roblox themselves like the Egg Hunt; instead, independent developers are “contracted” to shimmy these elements into their games. Doesn’t make for a very memorable experience, and I don’t know if the microtransactions yielded are any higher than they were for the previous events.

The search function on the website is pretty broken; for example, if you search the cosmetics catalog for “Adidas hoodie”, that can net you “ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS” named items that may not be a hoodie or relevant to what you’re looking for at all, just something that’s spammed the tag you searched for. This has been the case for years and no attempt to remedy it is evident.

Recently, user-generated content (UGC) has been introduced to the cosmetics catalog, in which approved users can upload hats and other cosmetics rather than just Roblox themselves as before. One of the only good features introduced in the last few years in my opinion, but as a result, Roblox itself has essentially stopped making any cosmetics themselves.

Basically, with the content creation almost exclusively done by independent users and developers, the site now runs itself. As a result, it feels the platform has been stagnating creatively for years. Beyond updating the game client, it’s not really clear what (if anything) Roblox does behind the scenes to promote growth. There’s a lot of very simple improvements and features that could be introduced to satisfy the user base and maintain the appeal to kids and the older audience, but Roblox seems to be reluctant to do so for some reason. For instance, it’s weird that users are begging for on-site sales, which are such a cornerstone of almost any business, or site events, which should be essential as a social game platform. This makes me worry they are forgetting that their user base made them successful in the first place. In short, it doesn’t seem to have the exponential growth it saw from 2007 to the early/mid-2010s, which is worrisome as the platform as a whole is not doing a good job at creating a loyal user base.

All that being said, this is my perspective of a player. I hope a developer can chime in with their thoughts on the pros and cons of developing on Roblox, what their Robux income looks like, and how that translates into real-world currency.

**EDIT:** This post has blown up way past the point I expected it to. As such, I feel it's necessary to address some of the points that myself and others have brought up in this thread. Going forward, this will be more of a financial approach that can tie in with my product/customer analysis.

[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:

>***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  
>  
>We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2 million, $86.0 million, and $203.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0 million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

Roblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:

>***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  
>  
>We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March 31, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September 30, 2019 to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  
>  
>• **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  
>  
>• **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  
>  
>**• increase global awareness of our brand.**

The bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:

>***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  
>  
>Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.

Largely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.

So, let's conclude. Where do we stand?

* [Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/vzbeykpuffj61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb544d5496049a3bd14bce8db3cad31e1896db6a)
   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?
   * This is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)
* [Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.](https://www.amazon.com/roblox?=&_encoding=UTF8&tag=r05d13-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=5562fc29c05b45562a86358c198356eb&camp=1789&creative=9325&productGridPageIndex=2)
* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.
   * For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2 million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8 million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.

So, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.

**EDIT 2**: I feel the need to address a point brought up in [this comment chain, which is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine & platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.

For Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of ""kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative"", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.

The game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. [Here are some images showing what's possible.](https://preview.redd.it/s5b0bxgqkfj61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc1447a41923c6ec69d9626a644d486c54c3af78) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:

>68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

These kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:

>For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.

A lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns. Furthermore, the most popular games are cash grab ""simulators"" and carbon copies of games that already exist, sometimes with stolen assets. That presents a copyright problem if Roblox is to continue expanding.

j4rn03,investing,"If you're new to investing, don't trust the ""gurus.""","My friends - as a beginner who has recently started making (a little bit more serious) efforts into learning how to invest and trading, let me share some findings with you.

&#x200B;

1. DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE LIKE STEVEN DUX. Every person in the financial industry has an objective one way or another. Why do you think they keep playing up the fact that they're rich but ask you to participate in their courses or ""learn their secrets"" for a couple thousands of your hard-earned cash? Because they want to take advantage of your inexperience and sell you something that seems grand but is usually something that you can Google or learn easily on your own. There are no ""industry trade secrets"" in investing; if there were, a lot more people like these ones offering you such ""secrets"" would be billionaires and wouldn't bother trying to ""teach"" you something that you don't know.

&#x200B;

2. Take information from a variety of resources. Don't take anyone's offer in selecting ""stocks"" for you that will make you rich overnight. These are tremendous red flags because investments are a deeply personal choice. You invest in companies that you believe in and that YOU think will do well. If all he/she does is offer you a plan that is obscure in where you're putting your money or promises instant wealth with ""unicorn"" companies, they will run with your money. Do your research, learn basic financial concepts from places like Investopedia, and find companies that you truly think will stand the test of time and will grow. Think about it: would you want to throw all your funds at ""tried and tested"" companies like Exxon because some investment guru said it's the best choice (but you personally disagree with or think is going to fail in the future), or invest in a company like Patagonia (ethically respectable, well-known, and trusted) or Google (world-renowned and used, not the best ethically but you know that no one's going to give up their search engine in a long, long time) that you trust for the medium-long term?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Make your own decisions and learn things for yourself one step at a time instead of placing your trust and funds into the hands of another. It'll pay off in the long run, I guarantee it.",2020-10-04 02:36:49,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222479,1239 days 19:56:09.222480,240,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j4rn03/if_youre_new_to_investing_dont_trust_the_gurus/

The retailer’s sales totaled $22.3 billion in the three months ended Oct. 31, a $3.9 billion increase from the same period last year. By comparison, the chain’s increase in sales for the entire preceding fiscal year was $2.7 billion. In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter. It’s an utterly herculean operational lift — requiring a rethinking of supply chain, inventory management and labor models — and it bodes well for Target’s long-term prospects that it was able to adapt to these conditions so quickly.""

jkhs1v,investing,"Amazon beats, Earnings: $12.37 vs $7.41 expected, Revenue: $96.15b vs $92.7b expected","(CNBC) Amazon reported better-than-expected third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, including soaring profits and 37% revenue growth.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

Initial public offerings have been doing extremely well lately, bringing to mind the excesses of the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

Shares in Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International Ltd. jumped as much as 112 per cent in their debut Friday, after home-rental platform Airbnb Inc. closed 113 per cent above its IPO price in New York. JD Health International Inc. surged 56 per cent in its debut Tuesday while DoorDash Inc. soared 86 per cent in on Wednesday.

The FTSE Renaissance Global IPO Index, which tracks the performance of offerings worldwide, is up 82 per cent this year, compared with a 12 per cent gain for MSCI’s all-country equity index. Comparing the current period with the dot-com bubble is hard to do directly because the Renaissance IPO Index didn’t start until 2009, and a Bloomberg index that was around in the dot-com boom became defunct in 2017.

There are some pretty clear similarities between the Bloomberg index versus the S&P 500 in 1998-99 and the Renaissance gauge now, noted Cameron Crise, a macro strategist at Bloomberg. The performance after that in the late 1990s was even more dramatic. If IPOs were to follow the same pattern now, they would have a huge jump still to come -- before a pretty spectacular drop.

“The action in these names is definitely a concern for us,” said Matt Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., speaking about the U.S. IPOs.

“However, we’d also note that experience tells us that froth in the IPO market tends to be a ‘leading indicator’ for an important top -- not an ‘immediate indicator’ of a top. In other words, yesterday’s action in the IPO market probably tells us that we’ll see a meaningful correction at some point over the next six to nine months, not necessarily over the next few days/weeks.”",2020-12-11 15:14:22,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222560,1171 days 07:18:36.222560,521,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kb4ln0/the_current_ipo_craze_is_starting_to_look_a_lot/

>Snap shares plunged 40% on Tuesday, putting the company on pace for its worst day ever and dragging down other social media and digital ad company stocks.

>The tumble comes after Snap issued a warning on Monday to investors saying it won’t meet its own targets for revenue and adjusted earnings in the current quarter.

>“Since we issued guidance on April 21, 2022, the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated,” the parent company of Snapchat said in an SEC filing. Snap’s shares are down about 83% from a 52-week high in September 2021 and are off 70% year to date.

>The filing also led its peers with a heavy reliance on advertising down in the afternoon. Shares of Meta were down more than 8%, Roku fell more than 15% and Pinterest dropped over 24%. Alphabet and Twitter dipped 6% and 3%, respectively.

>Snap’s warning is also impacting the ad tech industry. The Trade Desk fell 18%, Magnite slipped 12% and PubMatic is also down more than 13%.

>“We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Tuesday note to investors. “Advertising is cyclical.”

>Fears around inflation, interest rate concerns, continued supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine have forced some advertisers and brands to rethink ad spend in the current quarter. Companies, including Snap, have been pressured into slowing hiring and cutting back costs in an effort to make up for losses.

a9dmr3,investing,Just remember this.,"**In the first stage of an upward market**—one that has been down awhile and that nobody expects to rise again—people aren’t talking about stocks. In fact, if they lumber up to ask me what I do for a living, and I answer, “I manage an equity mutual fund,” they nod politely and wander away. 

If they don’t wander away, then they quickly change the subject to the Celtics game, the upcoming elections, or the weather. Soon they are talking to a nearby dentist about plaque.

When ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to the manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it’s likely that the market is about to turn up.

**In stage two**, after I’ve confessed what I do for a living, the new acquaintances linger a bit longer—perhaps long enough to tell me how risky the stock market is—before they move over to talk to the dentist. The cocktail party talk is still more about plaque than about stocks. The market’s up 15 percent from stage one, but few are paying attention.

**In stage three**, with the market up 30 percent from stage one, a crowd of interested parties ignores the dentist and circles around me all evening. A succession of enthusiastic individuals takes me aside to ask what stocks they should buy. 

Even the dentist is asking me what stocks he should buy.

Everybody at the party has put money into one issue or another, and they’re all discussing what’s happened.

**In stage four,** once again they’re crowded around me—but this time it’s to tell me what stocks I should buy. Even the dentist has three or four tips, and in the next few days I look up his recommendations in the newspaper and they’ve all gone up. When the neighbors tell me what to buy and then I wish I had taken their advice, it’s a sure sign that the market has reached a top and is due for a tumble.

ja3gzj,investing,Disney says its ‘primary focus’ for entertainment is streaming — announces a major reorg,"Disney is restructuring its media and entertainment divisions, as streaming becomes the most important facet of the company’s media business.

On Monday, the company revealed that in order to further accelerate its direct-to-consumer strategy, it would be centralizing its media businesses into a single organization that will be responsible for content distribution, ad sales and Disney+.

Shares of the company jumped more than 5% during after-hours trading following the announcement.

The move by Disney comes as the global coronavirus pandemic has crippled its theatrical business and ushered more customers toward its streaming options. As of August, Disney has 100 million paid subscribers across its streaming offerings, more than half of whom are subscribers to Disney+.

“I would not characterize it as a response to Covid,” CEO Bob Chapek told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on “Closing Bell” on Monday. “I would say Covid accelerated the rate at which we made this transition, but this transition was going to happen anyway.”

“We are tilting the scale pretty dramatically [toward streaming],” Chapek said on “Closing Bell,” noting that the company is looking at all investments, **including dividends**, as it seeks to increase its spend on new content. Chapek said the board of directors will have the final say on Disney’s dividend payouts.

Only last week, activist investor Dan Loeb called on Chapek to end the company’s annual $3 billion dividend to divert more capital to new Disney+ content.

Loeb’s Third Point Capital is one of Disney’s largest shareholders and bought more shares earlier this year in support of Disney’s repositioning around Disney+, its flagship subscription streaming service.

Loeb told CNBC, “We are pleased to see that Disney is focused on the same opportunity that makes us such enthusiastic shareholders: investing heavily in the DTC business, positioning Disney to thrive in the next era of entertainment.”

Chapek said the reorganization could result in some reduction of staff, but not likely at the same scale as was seen at the company’s parks division last month. Disney was forced to lay off around 28,000 workers after it became clear that its Disneyland parks in California would not be reopening soon.

As part of this reorganization, Disney has promoted Kareem Daniel, the former president of consumer products, games and publishing. He will now oversee the new media and entertainment distribution group.

He’ll be in charge of making sure streaming becomes profitable, as the company continues to invest heavily in its various streaming products. Daniel will hold the reins to all of the company’s streaming services and domestic television networks, including all content distribution, sales and advertising.

Disney is becoming more reliant on Disney+ as movie theaters have been unable to recover after being shuttered in March due to the outbreak. Ticket sales have been particularly lackluster at domestic cinemas since the industry attempted a large-scale reopening in late August.

In recent months, the company pushed back a number of its theatrical releases including its Marvel blockbuster “Black Widow.” The much anticipated Pixar film “Soul” has also been postponed. It will now arrive on Disney+ in December.

Analysts are still awaiting word from Disney about how “Mulan” fared after Disney removed it from theatrical release and sold it through Disney+ for $30. It is expected the company will share more details about its performance during its next earnings report in November.

Daniel will be responsible, in part, for making big decisions about Disney’s theatrical and streaming release schedules going forward.

″[Consumers] are going to lead us,” Chapek said on “Closing Bell.” “Right now they are voting with their pocketbooks, and they are voting very heavily toward Disney+. We want to make sure that we are going the way the consumers want us to go.”

**Reorganizing Disney’s media business**

Alan Horn and Alan Bergman will remain in charge of the company’s studios, Peter Rice will continue to head the company’s general entertainment group, and James Pitaro will stay as head of the company’s sports content.

All will report directly to CEO Bob Chapek. The company’s parks, experiences and products segment will remain under the leadership of Josh D’Amaro, and Rebecca Campbell will remain on as the chairman of direct-to-consumer and international operations. Campbell will report directly to Chapek for all things related to international operations but will report to Daniel when it comes to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

“Given the incredible success of Disney+ and our plans to accelerate our direct-to-consumer business, we are strategically positioning our Company to more effectively support our growth strategy and increase shareholder value,” Chapek said in a statement announcing the reorganization. “Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it.”

Under Horn and Bergman, the studios segment will focus on creating content for theatrical release, Disney+ and Hulu. Walt Disney Studios, Marvel Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures all fall under their purview.

Rice’s general entertainment segment includes 20th Television, ABC Signature and Touchstone Television, ABC News, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX and National Geographic.

As for Pitaro’s sports segment, that will focus on live sports programming, sports news and original and nonscripted sports-related content across ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC.

Daniel’s media and entertainment distribution group will manage all distribution, operations, sales and advertising across the three content groups. Daniel has spent 14 years with the company in a variety of positions. He helped transform Disney’s Star Wars property into the two Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge lands in Disney World and Disneyland as well as aided in bringing Toy Story Land, Pixar Pier and Avengers Campus to the parks.

“Kareem is an exceptionally talented, innovative and forward-looking leader, with a strong track record for developing and implementing successful global content distribution and commercialization strategies,” said Chapek.

This new structure is effective immediately. The company currently expects to transition its financial reporting to reflect these changes beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Additionally, Disney announced that it will hold a virtual investor day on Dec. 10.

ukx5hk,investing,Ford Motor is selling 8 million of its Rivian Automotive shares. The automaker currently owns 102 million shares of Rivian. Ford will be selling the shares through Goldman Sachs," 

Ford Motor is selling 8 million of its Rivian Automotive shares, with the insider lockup for the stock of the once high-flying electric vehicle maker is set to expire on Sunday, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

The automaker currently owns 102 million shares of Rivian. Ford will be selling the shares through Goldman Sachs, sources said.

The lockup defines a period of time after a company has gone public when early investors and company insiders cannot sell their shares. That ensures the IPO is carried out in an orderly manner and does not flood the market with additional shares.

 

JPMorgan Chase also plans to sell a Rivian share block of between 13 million and 15 million for an unknown seller, sources told Faber. Both blocks of stocks are priced at $26.90 a share.

Shares of the EV manufacturer have plummeted by more than 50% in the first three months of 2022, reversing course from the fourth quarter, when the company held its stock market debut and saw its value skyrocket.

nmetge,investing,Apple represents 20.13% of Vanguard's Information Technology ETF (VGT); Microsoft represents 16%.

I've been tossing a few dollars into VGT since last year, under the assumption that since it's an ETF, my investments will be broadly diversified across the information technology industry.

1. Is this dramatic skewedness toward just one or two companies unusual in an ETF?
2. Does anyone care to explain why such a skewness is justified in this case?

x9fwuc,investing,I collect coins and banknotes as a hobby. Here is why buying money with the a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on it thinking these are going to become collectables is a bad investment idea,"Over the next week or so there is going to be a wave of people passing through here with the 'unique' idea that they are going to buy some British banknotes or coins and that in just a short time its going to be a higly sought after collectable. It wont. This is a bad investment idea. Now naturally the kind of person who comes up with this get-rich-quick scheme is going to try anyway, but for the rest of us I will try and explain here why this is a bad idea.

First, let me clarify the difference between currency value and collectable value. If I get a five quid note and I pay five quid to get it, this does not mean it is a collectable. That is just how money works. For something to be collectable it has to have a value above and beyond what you would be able to use it as if you just spent it as cash. To extend this just a tiny bit more, if I got an ultra rare limited edition five quid note that is in mint condition and I pay a million quid for it, the actual colectable value is nine hundred ninty nine thousand nine hundred ninty five quid.

The next thing I need to explain is marginal value. Lets say a store was selling apples. What would be the better sale price? Half off? Or buy one get one free? At first thought this seems total nonsense. Thats the same thing! But not so fast. What if I was selling toothbrushes? Do I realy need two toothbrushes? If I got a second toothbrush, one of those is just going to be kept under the sink untill the first toothbrush wears out. I would rather just get one toothbrush only and get it for half off. This is marginal utility.

So with both of these idea in mind, lets talk about coin collecting. Say someone wants to start collecting and the first thing they try is getting all five of the ""five good emperors"". They go to a few swap meats and quickly start acquiring the set. But  Nerva  is giving them some problems. No matter where they go, they cant seem to find a  Nerva. But they keep at it and soon enough they find one for sale but its $200. Ouch! Thats above their price point for just a starting collection, but they realy want to have the whole set. So they break down and pay it. A few more months roll by and they once again find someone selling a  Nerva  and selling it for $199. I this was absolutely any other product it would be natural to think they would buy this second one also. But what about the collectable value? What about the marginal utility? Do they honestly need a second copy of the  Emperor  Nerva  coin? The series is already complete so what's the point of having it in your collection twice? Who cares if its a buck cheaper. They wouldn't even buy it to try and ""flip"" to another collector. The time and effort they would need to go to in order to flip it would bot be worth making just $1 in profit.

And that leads us finally to Queen Elizabeth II. Coins and banknotes with her likeness are not rare to begin with. Supply already way outstrips demand. But even on the demand side, collectables do not follow the regular supply-and-demand curve. Every economic textbook out there shows this graph as a smooth gently curving function. But the supply-and-demand for collectables doesn't do that. There is a hard upper limit that is the total number of people that are collectors. If the number of coins is less than the number of collectors, there will be demand. But if the number of coins is more than the number of people that are into the hobby, you do not get a slow gradual tapering off. You get a graph that drops off a cliff.

There are ancient roman coins out there that you can get even today that are just the value of the metal the coin is minted from. The collectable value that is above and buying the value of the base metal is basically zero. This is true despite the emperor depicted on the coin being dead for thousands of years. The reason they have no collectable value is ttoaly decoupled from the emperor being alive or dead. The lack of collectable value comes from the fact that the number of coins in existence is larger than the number of people in the hobby. There is enough to give all collectors at least one, and nobody cares about having a second one.

Coins and Banknotes with Queen Elizabeth II will never have a collectable value. Dont even try to buy them up now with the hope that in the future you can sell them for more. It wont happen. It cant happen. Don't even try. If you want to use this event as motivation to get into coin collecting as a hobby them have at it! Its a great pastime and I will welcome you. But if your just out to flip coins as a get rich quick scheme, then dont.

""You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that this coin will increase in value, or even hold its current value. The truth is, you brought it cuz you like it. It has value to you. That's what matters""",2022-09-08 23:57:39,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222631,534 days 22:35:19.222631,198,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/x9fwuc/i_collect_coins_and_banknotes_as_a_hobby_here_is/

A highly anticipated SEC report attributed the episode primarily to a rapid increase in trading by individual investors, many of whom used social-media platforms like Reddit to swap ideas and strategies. The agency poured cold water on a number of alternative hypotheses for why the struggling videogame retailer’s share price soared from less than $20 at the end of 2020 to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28.

The SEC also found no evidence to support theories that gained traction on social media around brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc.’s [US:HOOD] decision to restrict trading in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that day.

The SEC said shortening the amount of time it takes for brokers to clear equity trades from the current period of two days could make the market less risky during times of heightened volatility. It also said more reporting of short sales—a method of betting a stock’s price will decline—could help regulators monitor markets.",2021-10-18 20:48:53,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222641,860 days 01:44:05.222641,156,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qavp6o/gamestop_trading_frenzy_tested_resilience_of/

WSJ recently wrote an article about it, you can easily find an article if you are interested.

I hear the same again and again: ""anyone can do a job of an average financial advisor"". Below is a story of a person from the industry.

>We had a group of 5 mutual funds and our decision to decide what fund to put them in was based on one question: “on a scale of 1-5, what is your risk tolerance”. We asked every single client this and based on their answer plus their age, income and savings we put them in one of those  
>  
>I thought even a monkey could do my job at first but was amazed how many clients wouldn’t invest at all and just had their money sitting in cash. I wondered how even without an advisor why people couldn’t/wouldn’t pick pretty much any mutual fund and put their money there  
>  
>I got paid based on how much I got people to invest and thought it would be easy money to convince people to make their assets grow but it was damn hard. Most clients had money in a CD and would refuse to move it

j7ywgy,investing,For the people: Moderna won't enforce COVID-19 vaccine patent during the pandemic," **What is Happening?**  
Moderna is [not enforcing patents](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&id=3c063d1caf&e=0a139504b4) on its coronavirus vaccine. Per Moderna's President Stephen Hoge: ""We're not interested in using that IP to decrease the number of vaccines available in a pandemic"". 

**Why does this Matter?**

This is an enormous development for the efforts being made by other companies and governments across the globe. Moderna will not be blocking further advances made by other firms due to proprietary information.   


Investors have reportedly been inquiring about what Moderna had been planning to do with the patents for quite some time. Moderna executives found it important to notify both investors and the greater public that pharmaceutical firms will be working together to address the COVID-19 pandemic as efficiently as possible.   


This is obviously a positive sentiment for the greater market. The sooner pharmaceutical companies mass-produce an effective vaccine, the sooner we can enter economic recovery.

r8y1jr,investing,Bitcoin is not a safe haven or digital gold. It's a risk-on asset.,"No matter whether you like like crypto's or not, recent days have made it clear again Bitcoin is not a ""safe haven"" or ""digital gold"" which some claim it to be.

In the past week when equity markets sold off because of Fed tapering fears and lower then expected nonfarm payrolls, bitcoin also went down almost 20%.

I'm not judging those that want to speculate on cryptos, just don't call it a safe haven. If anything it's a risk-on asset which follows more the sentiment in stocks.

If you want a safe haven right now **consider 5-10% gold in portfolio.** Most probably hold an ETF like $GLD for that. Gold futures went up more than a percent on friday.

For those that will point out gold didn't go up in the past 10 years, that's because the Fed kept printing money which has helped bloating the stock market. Fed already announed they will finally taper off this QE and might even want to do it faster. **Over longer periods of time like the past 20 and 30 years gold has even outperformed the S&P500.**

Concerning holding **bonds** as safe haven keep in mind those can be hit hard if Fed speeds up its QE tapering and starts raising interest rates which will happen eventually.",2021-12-04 20:13:04,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222676,813 days 02:19:54.222677,847,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r8y1jr/bitcoin_is_not_a_safe_haven_or_digital_gold_its_a/
escewo,investing,"Temporary rule change: ""what happens to stocks if [candidate/party] gets elected"" posts are no longer allowed, at least until the end of this election cycle.","This one is probably long coming but these posts add absolutely nothing to the investment discussion.  They're simply bait for people to express their political views under the veil of markets.  Without fail every time we have one of these threads someone gets banned for political attacks and the whole thing gets shut down.  

Obviously policy impacts markets, and we have to be appreciative of people's differing (civil and thoughtful)views on policy so topics concerning specific policy initiatives will still be allowed but they must be clearly and obviously tied to investing.  The policy must also be flushed out and have a reasonable chance of becoming law.  This means ""what happens to markets if we get universal Healthcare"" or ""what would a wealth tax do"" isn't acceptable.  You would need to have something more specific such as ""what is the risk to insurance stocks under proposed law XYZ"".  Basically all of this comes down to effort: if the question looks like a low effort fishing expedition for a political argument it'll be taken as such.  If OP displays a specific understanding of the topic and displays effort to directly relate to investing then that should absolutely be allowed. 

Under these guidelines policy proposals from candidates are going to come under extra scrutiny.  In the financial world we are concerned with probabilities and within that context proposals that are unlikely to ever make it beyond campaign speeches are going to be pretty heavily restricted.  What I mean by that is if Sanders or Warren mention a wealth tax ""what happens if we get a wealth tax"" isn't a thread that needs to happen here.  I think we're all willing to be flexible on topics here but the further away something is from reality the less it needs to be a topic here.  

Here's an example: Last month the Secure Act made it's way in to a budget bill.  This is the largest change to retirement plan rules since the pension protection act of 06.  There were two threads on this topic with aggregate upvotes of less than 10.  Any given low effort question concerning a current candidate makes it to the front page in minutes.  I'll be honest, I feel like we as mods have not done a good job when real world policy that impacts everyone is not a hot topic here but hypothesizing how legislation that doesn't exist is.  So with that context in mind we're going to be taking the aforementioned steps to remove some of the threads that are thinly veiled attempts to talk general politics.

That said, one further clarification: this does not extend to any sort of research, white papers, etc concerning said policy and markets.  Goldman publishes their thoughts on how universal health care would impact different sectors?  Absolutely post it up.  A study of equity performance under new taxation in other countries?  Go for it.  You want to ask what happens to stocks if the US has a communist revolution?  Kindly do so in /r/politics. 


the rules on the sidebar will be adjusted to reflect this shortly.  Feel free to provide feedback on specifics here, we're pretty set on the general direction but always open to subscriber feedback. 

Also one last note: we need to expand the mod team, we're all busy and there's a consistently increasing amount of rule breaking behavior.  In the past we've done so organically by selecting regulars with good history of contributing to be mods.  That will probably hold true going forward as well - IMO appointing mods that aren't longstanding contributors is how you end up with subs like /r/economics.  So if you're interested throw your name in the hat, I can't promise anything and if we don't recognize your username it's highly unlikely you'd be selected but I'd like to cast a line and see what hits.

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response.

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

i0lgxy,investing,"U.S. second-quarter GDP plunged by a record 32.9%, vs 34.7% expected - CNBC","-	The U.S. economy suffered its worst period ever in the second quarter, with GDP falling 32.9%.
-	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a decline of 34.7%.

The U.S. economy saw the biggest plunge in activity it has ever known in the second quarter, though it wasn't quite as bad as feared.

Gross domestic product from April to June plunged 32.9%, according to the Commerce Department's first reading on the data released Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 34.7%.

Still, it was the worst drop ever, with the closest previously coming in mid-1921.

Sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, investment and spending by state and local governments all converged to bring down GDP, which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period.

Spending slid in health care and goods such as clothing and footwear. Inventory investment drops were led by motor vehicle dealers, while equipment spending and new family housing took hits when it came to investment.

Prices for domestic purchases, a key inflation indicator, fell 1.5% for the period, compared to a 1.4% increase in the first quarter when GDP fell 5%, The personal consumption expenditures price index dropped 1.9% after rising a tepid 1.3% in Q1. Excluding food and energy, the ""core"" PCE prices were off 1.1%.

However, personal income soared, thanks in large part to government transfer payments associated with the coronavorus pandemic. Current-dollar personal income rose more than six-fold to $1.39 trillion, while disposable personal income shot up 42.1% to $1.53 trillion.

Despite the rise, personal outlays tumbled by $1.57 trillion, due in large part to a drop in services spending.

Not the Great Depression nor the Great Recession nor any of the more than three dozen economic slumps over the past two centuries have ever caused such a sharp drain over so short a period of time.

By comparison, the worst quarter during the financial crisis of 2008 was the 8.4% GDP drop in the fourth quarter of that year. The previous low-water mark was a 10% slide in the first quarter of 1958, while the worst in recorded history came in Q2 of 1921.

This particular tumble in activity owes to a different source than any of its predecessors: a government-induced shutdown aimed at combating Covid-19.

Workers across the country were told to stay home from any job not considered essential, resulting in a crushing halt that saw the unemployment rate peak at 14.7%, a post-Depression high. The National Bureau of Economic Research said the current recession actually started in February, a month before the pandemic declaration.

I’m currently in Shanghai now, from my observation people in the West are not spending enough time talking about how devastating this virus has been to the Chinese economy and its certain global ramifications.

Let’s take the city of Shanghai for example. It’s not one of the more heavily impacted cities, it’s not quarantined and people can mostly come and go freely. Many businesses are still open, from restaurants to malls.

However for the first time ever I saw an Apple store with more employees than customers, and an open Starbucks with absolutely zero customers inside. The streets on a Saturday afternoon were about as empty as it would be at midnight on a regular weekday. All of this is happening during what’s supposed to be the  busiest week for consumer spendings in China.

The worst part is this doesn’t seem like it will change any time soon. Shanghai just announced that they will extend the CNY holidays by another week and people will like remain fearful for the coming weeks, if not months if we don’t see a dramatic turnaround of the virus situation.

What this means is that any Western company that relies significantly on China for revenue would see their first quarter earning absolutely *crushed*, especially considering their forecasts were done with the assumption of this quarter being the best quarter of the year. For example I’m foreseeing Apple miss their Greater China’s revenue by as much as 50% this quarter, and it would be even worse for companies like GM, Ford and the airlines. I’m not sure if it’s widely known, but China is GM’s largest market by revenue and Ford’s 2nd largest.

Further more this will impact the global manufacturing and supply chain significantly. I don’t know enough to model out a detailed scenario but my gut feeling tells me a prolonged manufacturing shutdown across major Chinese cities would be more than a little disruptive in that regard.

I’m discounting the impact of the virus if it were spread to other countries in any significant numbers, but even considering the situation in China alone it’s extremely worrying.

One final point is due to the significantly reduced traveling, China’s energy demand for this quarter would also be drastically reduced. It will likely impact global energy/oil prices and cause even further ripple effects.

**Edit**: for people tell me how CNY in Shanghai should make the city a ghost town... Yes a few million migrant workers (流动人口), leave town during this time, but there are still ~~10M~~ 15M local residents left. For them this is a week of shopping, 串门(visiting friends), taking their kids to places since it’s also winter break, etc. I grew up in this city and no, people don’t just spend a whole week of national holidays at home.

But yes... some businesses would be closed until 初四, and it may impact local expats’ favorite bars and clubs...

**Edit 2**: Some people are missing the point. No I’m not saying the 2% drop we had so far is “The Dip”, that’s just normal fluctuation. No I’m not saying you should sell everything because unless the world is ending (in which case you wouldn’t worry about your stocks), the market will bounce back. Hell it bounces back after 2008 stronger than ever. But at this point nobody knows just exactly how bad the damage would be and how long it would last, so it *will* be rocky in the short to medium term. No you don’t have to react but you also shouldn’t be surprised if the market does.

**Edit 3**: Jesus Christ people before you tell me how people tend to stay home and do nothing for Chinese New Year, I've spent 20+ CNY here as a local and that's just wrong. Last year people spent [$150B USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/china-lunar-new-year-holiday-retail-catering-sales-up-8-5-cctv) during CNY in consumer spendings.

w0eydc,investing,Musk asks court to reject Twitter’s request for ‘warp speed’ trial,"Related post on reddit: [**Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk’s Claims in Four Trial Days**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vyt06k/twitter_says_it_can_beat_musks_claims_in_four/)

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an “unjustifiable request to rush” the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter’s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network — one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal — was “fundamental” to the case and required lengthier investigation and “substantial time for discovery”.

Musk’s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a “breakneck schedule”.

“Twitter’s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,” the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company’s lawsuit accused Musk, the world’s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.

In a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk’s defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots — automated spam accounts — on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a “material adverse effect” that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.

Musk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday’s filing, which again questioned the company’s long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.

Following a meeting between Musk and Twitter’s chief executive Parag Agrawal, “Musk was stunned to discover that Twitter’s process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company’s machine learning capabilities”, the filing said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site’s issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.

The social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter’s leadership.

Addressing that claim, Musk’s filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.

“With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,” the filing stated. “Twitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.”

14624gb,investing,Your balance of life experiences > The balance in your retirement account,"I was recently feeling some regret about taking a trip to Greece with my wife. It was very fun, but we ended up staying longer and doing more things than we initially planned, spending about $10k total,  way over initial budget by quite a lot. We just lost track of our budget in the blur of fun. As a result, I had to cut back on retirement contributions this year and I was not happy about it. I kept obsessing over what that 10k might have been 20 years from now, had I invested it instead. But then I had a conversation with a close childhood friend.

This friend's father retired last year having lived the life of a frugal teetotal. He was obsessed with finance and investing. He read every book on the subject that he could and was extremely knowledgeable. I remember him giving my own father advice. He worked at a few different state agencies starting in his mid 20s and continued right up into his early 60s, ending with a low six figure salary. Throughout this time he was extremely frugal and retired with several million in various retirement accounts.

My friend was telling me that growing up, his father never took them on trips, took them out to a fancy restaurant only once a year, bought used/hand-me-down items instead of new things whenever possible, never drank, and in general just did not spend a dime on entertainment. They had board games in the house, and that was about it. I asked him what his favorite memories were of his childhood, and he couldn't really say. In other words, no memories really stood out among the sea of blandness.

I think you know what happens next.

Just one year after his father retired: BAM. Alzheimer's. Rapid onset. He now has severe dementia and will probably die in the next year or two.

The one thing his father did talk about a lot was that he always wanted to see Europe. Greece, Italy, and England in particular. Now that is not possible. He will die never having left the country. He hardly even travelled outside of his own state.

Listening to my friend describe his father's situation was sobering. Investing is, of course, a wise decision. But it should never come at the expense of experiences.

Retirement-aged people can and do have fun. But lets be real. Do you see a lot of 60+ people backpacking through Cambodia? Going bungee jumping? Going to a rave? Taking a cab home at 2 am after a night of drinking with friends? The reality is that the types of fun you can have dwindle as you age. Going to Spain at 58 is not the same as going at 28.

A final thought I had was that life is meant to be a party, a celebration. And at this party, who is the most interesting person to talk to: The guy explaining his 30 year process of accumulating 10 million in his bank account or the guy talking about his experience riding four wheelers amid ancient ruins on a Greek island? My post-Greece regret is gone. I'd spend that $10k again in a heartbeat.",2023-06-10 14:46:00,2024-02-25 22:32:58.222760,260 days 07:46:58.222760,357,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14624gb/your_balance_of_life_experiences_the_balance_in/

vekcxs,investing,This Time is Different (2001-2003 v. 2008 v. 2022),"I don't know how many of you are old enough to remember the Tech Bubble or The Great Recession, but I have been alive long enough to remember all of the major market corrections going back to 1973-74.  My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.

* * *

Shortly after Apple slashed its revenue guidance for the first quarter, Goldman Sachs said the iPhone maker will likely have to bring down numbers for the full year. As those results drop further, so will the company's shares, the firm said.

""We see the potential for further downside to FY19 numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019,"" wrote Goldman's Rod Hall in a note to clients late Wednesday.

The company sees first-quarter revenue of $84 billion vs. a previous guidance of a range of $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $91.3 billion for the period, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet. Apple blamed most of the revenue shortfall on a slowing economy in China in the second half.

Apple shares dropped more than 9 percent to $143.70 in premarket trading after ending the first day of 2019 at $157.92. And Goldman's Hall slashed his 12-month forecast to $140 from $182. He also lowered his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and his full-year EPS estimate by 10 percent to $11.66.

Nokia comparison
""We have been flagging China demand issues since late September and Apple's guidance cut confirms our view,"" wrote Hall. ""We do not expect the situation to get better in March and would remain cautious on the region.""

But the analyst went further, comparing Apple to the fallen phone maker Nokia, which became reliant on customer upgrades in the face of a saturated market more than a decade ago. Customers delayed replacing their phones for longer and longer as economy slowed, Goldman notes.

""Nokia saw rapid nexpansion of replacement rates in late 2007 that was well beyond what any linear forecast would have implied,"" wrote Hall. ""Beyond China, we don't see strong evidence of a consumer slowdown heading into 2019 but we just flag to investors that we believe Apple's replacement rates are likely much more sensitive to the macro now that the company is approaching maximum market penetration for the iPhone.""

Goldman got to its new price target by applying just a 12 multiple to the firm's new earnings estimate.

So, last month my system told me to short INNT from to June 18th to July 16th.  I opened a short position on 1420 shares (\~$15k at about $10.55 per share) on 6/18.  Unfortunately, INNT saw a massive spike (>100%) not long after I opened my position, presumably triggered by it getting added to the Russell 3000, 2000, and Microcap indexes.  Not great news, but I didn't panic and close the position -- I would stick it out through the frenzy out and follow the plan.

On July 11th, I got a surprise -- my brokerage had forcibly closed out my position, buying back the shares at a cost of about $35k.  It turns out that they had to execute a ""buy-in"" with no notice since they suddenly found themselves no longer able to lend me the INNT shares.  Presumably, other clients had sold their INNT shares, and the brokerage now didn't have enough shares for me to continue shorting.

Anyway, July 16th arrives (the date on which I was to close the position), and the share price drops to $8.08 per share.  So, had that forced buy-in not occurred, **I'd have made $3.5k rather than lost $20k.**

Lesson learned: Your brokerage can close your short position without any notice, regardless of your account's standing.  (And yes, I could have limited the loss via options, but that's not practical for my situation)",2018-07-17 17:01:50,2024-02-25 22:33:00.267766,2049 days 05:31:10.267767,321,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8zmwpu/i_just_lost_20000_a_cautionary_tale/

owu38q,investing,Tencent Dives After Chinese Media Call Online Games ‘Spiritual Opium’,"**As of typing this, Tencent is down 10%, Netease is down 14% and Bilibili is down 13% in Hong Kong**

Tencent Holdings Ltd. dived as much as 10% Tuesday after an offshoot of China’s official news agency decried the “spiritual opium” and “electronic drugs” of games, stoking fears Beijing will next set its sights on online entertainment.

The social media giant joined rivals NetEase Inc. and XD Inc. in an abrupt selloff in early Hong Kong trading after an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency published a blistering critique of the gaming industry. The Economic Information Daily cited a student as saying some schoolmates played Tencent’s Honor of Kings -- one of its most popular titles -- eight hours a day and called for stricter controls over time spent on games.

It spooked investors already on edge after Beijing came down hard on online industries from e-commerce to ride-hailing, triggering a global selloff of Chinese shares that at one point surpassed $1 trillion. Nervous investors continue to reevaluate their holdings as they ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent-backed Meituan and Didi Global Inc.

“No industry or sport should prosper by eradicating an entire generation,” the Xinhua article said, citing an academic at a state-backed institution.

127pnir,investing,"US Banks Have $620 Billion of Unrealized Losses on Their Books, Most banks are strong enough to withstand the paper losses. Still, their finances could be squeezed for years to come.","From bloomberg, there is excellent graphics in the article I would recommend viewing: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-svb-exposed-risks-banks/?srnd=premium#xj4y7vzkg

>The investment losses that helped take down Silicon Valley Bank are a problem, to one degree or another, across the US financial system. In total, the industry ended last year with $620 billion of unrealized losses on its books from investments in low-yielding bonds.

>For most banks, the issue is manageable.

>Bonds held in investment books represented less than a quarter of the banking system’s $23.6 trillion of assets in December, and unlike SVB, lenders usually have a wide array of depositors who are unlikely to all need money around the same time. For the biggest banks, the risks are even smaller. They are perceived as too big to fail. What’s more, the recent rally in the Treasury bond market — sparked, ironically, by the jitters about the health of the banking industry — is helping to shrink the $620 billion of paper losses. (In the coming weeks, banks will start to post first-quarter data.)
Banks’ Equity Could Take Hit If Paper Losses Had to Be Realized
For most banks, unrealized losses are a manageable problem. But investors and depositors remain jittery about lenders sitting on huge piles of money-losing bonds

>And yet as depositors keep gradually withdrawing their money and shifting it into money market funds and other investments, banks are facing a squeeze. They’re being pressed to pay more for funding while their revenue is limited by the investments they made in low-yielding bonds during the pandemic. That in turn could curb their ability to lend to consumers and businesses, slowing the economy.

>“They’re paying more for deposits, and their earnings on bonds are fixed,” said Stan August, a retired bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and a former bond analyst at Bank of America. “That’s where the squeeze is.”

>When the pandemic hit, and the Federal Reserve pushed down rates once again by pumping unprecedented amounts of cash into the economy, many banks loaded up on long-term government and mortgage-backed bonds. There were some Treasury notes that promised to pay annual interest of just 0.6% over 10 years.

>Then inflation surged and the Fed started urgently driving up interest rates. The value of those bonds plunged, because who would want to buy an old bond paying 0.6% interest when new ones were suddenly paying more than 3%?

>Losses on bonds are a risk whenever rates go up, but banks’ holdings were bigger than usual in 2022. All that cash the Fed and the government pushed into the economy quickly found its way into the banking system, giving lenders trillions of dollars to invest. SVB’s domestic deposits, for instance, rose more than 150% from the end of March 2020 through the end of 2022.

>Rising deposits on their own don’t necessarily represent a problem for banks. For SVB, they spelled trouble in part because its clients tended to keep large balances at the bank as a condition for receiving services like lines of credit.

>That translated to a high percentage of customers’ deposits being bigger than US deposit insurance limits. Clients with high balances at a bank are often skittish about the safety of their funds. and more likely to withdraw money fast at signs of trouble.

>There were at least three data points for SVB that worried depositors: the speed at which the bank’s deposits had grown, the high percentage of uninsured deposits it had, and the magnitude of losses relative to its equity. These factors helped create a perfect storm.

>But even for banks that dodge the storm, bond losses are a problem. A large part of banks’ investment portfolios use an accounting method called “held to maturity” that ensures the firms don’t have to record any losses, or any hits to their balance sheets, from the declining value of their bonds. But they also have to hold onto the bonds until they mature.
Banks Locked Up Trillions in Long-Term Investments
Total holdings, at amortized cost, in held-to-maturity securities for banks with at least $25 billion in assets as of Q4 2022

>As banks’ deposits started to grow during the pandemic, they initially plowed more money into bonds using a method of accounting called “available for sale.” For these securities, changes in the value of the bonds would affect their balance sheets but not their income statements. That accounting method can force banks to boost their capital levels, though, if their losses get too high.

>In 2021, a growing group of banks believed the Fed would soon begin raising interest rates and began switching to counting more of their bonds as held-to-maturity. The biggest banks added about $1.7 trillion of the bonds to their books over the two years ended in December. In some cases, they switched bonds over from one accounting treatment to the other. In other cases, they just stopped buying new available-for-sale securities and only added to their held-to-maturity books.

>Initially it worked pretty well. Profits ballooned. The US banking system’s return on equity, a measure of profitability, averaged 12.2% in 2021, the highest since 2006.

>But now that inflation and rate hikes have come, banks have suddenly been finding themselves pressured from two sides. Higher interest rates forced banks to pay more money to win deposits, with average one-year CD rates rising to about 2.7% by March, according to DepositAccounts, from 0.35% in May 2022. Consumers and companies have been taking more of their money out of banks and investing it in assets like government bonds. Deposits in commercial banks fell last year for the first time since 1948, according to the FDIC. The worst pain here is for community and regional banks, which lost $109 billion of deposits in the week ended March 15, while the biggest banks have been luring funds.

>Meanwhile, the value of banks’ bond holdings plunged on paper too. The $620 billion of unrealized losses in the system at the end of 2022 were for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.

>The combination of surging interest rates, high investment losses and heavy deposit outflows is new for most investors and executives in the banking industry. To many, this feels like uncharted territory.

>“I have covered this industry for 20 years plus and I have never seen anything like this,” said Ania Aldrich, an investment principal at Cambiar Investors. “In all the stress testing we have done for at least the largest banks have never stressed for anything like this.”

>Comments from banks

>Charles Schwab Bank & Charles Schwab Premier Bank

>“Focusing attention on ‘unrealized losses’ in our held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio is very misleading. These ‘paper losses’ are unrealized and would only be realized if we had to sell those securities. The profile of our depositors is very different from regional banks. Given our significant access to sources of liquidity, there is a near-zero chance we’d need to sell any of our HTM portfolio prior to maturity. That would be akin to assuming a large retail bank would sell a substantial portion of its loan portfolio... Client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm. As is the case in every cycle, clients make choices about where to best allocate their assets. As interest rates have increased over the last year, our clients have made choices to reallocate assets within their Schwab portfolios, to reflect their preferences in this market. And in fact, we have actively encouraged them to do so. The important point is that those allocation decisions result in the assets staying at Schwab. Despite the events of the last two weeks, we have not seen any meaningful change in client behavior regarding their cash… Comparing unrealized losses across firms with different business models can be misleading. Schwab Bank has a different business model than traditional banks. Our deposits come from transactional cash in clients’ brokerage accounts that is swept to our banks. We use about 10% of that cash to fund loans to our existing clients and with the remaining 90%, we buy securities – the vast majority of which are backed by the U.S. Government. With rates moving up, the fair value of all fixed rate assets — loans or securities — has gone down. But given that our securities are very high quality, we fully expect our securities to reach par at maturity, which means the unrealized ‘paper’ losses will decrease over time. Because a much higher percentage of our assets are securities — and traditional bank loans are not disclosed the same way — our paper losses may appear larger than those of traditional banks. But that assessment lacks the appropriate context. In reality, our portfolio has less credit risk and is actually less sensitive to changes in interest rates than many large banks,” Co-Chairmen Charles Schwab and Walt Bettinger said in a statement.

>First National Bank of Pennsylvania

>“Due to FNB’s conservative balance sheet and interest rate risk management leading into this higher rate environment, the duration and fair value marks of our AFS and HTM portfolios were more favorable than others in the industry. Even after fully incorporating these marks into our Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, we would remain well capitalized. In addition, FNB has a stable and granular deposit base and maintains a strong liquidity position with uninsured deposits excluding fully collateralized balances at only 27% and has available funding sources in excess of those balances,” CEO Vincent J. Delie, Jr. said in a statement.

>Prosperity Bank

>“Prosperity Bank has a fortress balance sheet that is well suited for times like this. In fact, we were a source of strength in the 80’s and 2008, participating in six FDIC assisted transactions. We are a traditional community bank with a diverse loan portfolio and a granular deposit base amongst the many communities that we are in. We have close to 800,000 deposit accounts with an average balance of $36,000, our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits only make up 32% of our total deposits, we have access to large amounts of liquidity, and we are extremely well capitalized. We maintain higher tangible common equity ratios than many of the large money center banks and remain well capitalized even if you include any unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity portfolio. It has been our pleasure to serve the communities we are in and help our customers navigate and understand all that is happening in the banking markets,’’ Cullen Zalman, senior vice president for banking and corporate activities at Prosperity Bank, said in a statement.

>USAA Federal Savings Bank

>“USAA is a fundamentally different bank than those that have struggled over the past few weeks. Our bank is consumer based, 93% of deposits are within the applicable FDIC insurance limits, and we have access to substantial liquidity to serve the needs of our members. USAA FSB also goes through rigorous stress testing to help us best support our members. Focusing on any single asset class is misguided, given additional ways to evaluate bank balance sheets, like net interest trends, which highlight the efficiencies or inefficiencies across a bank’s entire balance sheet. The degree of changes in USAA’s unrealized bond holdings is a reflection of a relatively low loan-to-deposit ratio, which means investments are a larger part of our balance sheet and accounting value fluctuations are more noticeable. But not all banks and not all investment portfolios are the same. Unrealized bond losses do not create excess risk in institutions with a stable base of customers, a strong capital position, the ability to hold such bonds to maturity and access to the liquidity necessary to meet their depositors’ and borrowers’ needs.”
First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co.

>“First Citizens is a well-capitalized bank, and our post-acquisition capital ratios remain within or above our target ranges. In addition, the transaction is structured to maintain our position of strength with ample liquidity and credit loss protections. Our liquidity remains strong and stable driven by conservatively managed investment portfolio, and it is enhanced by this transaction.” First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. acquired Silicon Valley Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., though the sale did not include $90 billion in securities and other assets.
Huntington National Bank

>“Per the company’s 10K, 68% of deposits at Huntington are insured / 32% are uninsured as of December 31, 2022. This is the lowest % of uninsured deposits among all US based publicly traded banks with $50bn+ in deposits (excluding those classified primarily as card issuers). Huntington has an active hedging program for securities, and total FV marks net of hedges for all securities are in line with peers.”

>Northern Trust Co.

>“Northern Trust is a global provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, and individuals. Northern Trust has offices in the United States as well as 23 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region… Our clients leave large amounts of deposits with us not because we offer higher rates, but because they have significant payment activity. Over 60% of our institutional deposits are considered operational by regulatory standards… Northern Trust’s business model focuses on two core markets: institutions and wealthy individuals/families. These have been our historic strengths for generations. Retail banking represents a small percentage of our client base and an even smaller percentage of our assets on deposit, which in part accounts for the low percentage of insured deposits when compared with other banks that have significantly larger retail portfolios. Northern Trust is a Category II institution under the Federal Reserve’s regulatory framework. As a result, we are the only non G-SIB required to do daily liquidity testing and report unrealized losses in regulatory capital reporting. We consistently are assigned the highest long-term credit rating of any comparable U.S. institution. Northern Trust maintains a high-quality securities portfolio. Highly liquid assets constitute 62% of total client deposits as of Dec. 31, 2022. 81% of Northern Trust’s securities portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury, government sponsored agency and triple-A rated securities. Regarding unrealized, mark-to-market HTM investment security losses as a percentage of tangible equity, it is important to note that our balance sheet composition has a lower proportion of loans, and thus our investment securities portfolio will be larger on both an absolute and percentage basis than banks with similar asset sizes.”

ld4k0x,investing,Why I am bearish on BB (technical analysis),"I'm a Software Eng. and therefore will only cover the technical aspects. As you might already see in the title, I'm bearish on BB. I decided to share my thoughts, since a lot of people (and analysts) seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stock.I want to give a quick and **very abstract** introduction on technical terms:

# Technicalities

BB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.

Why would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.

However some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# Contra BB (QNX):

The following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):

1. Toyota
2. VW
3. Daimler
4. Ford
5. Honda
6. BMW
7. GM

&#x200B;

1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).
2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.
3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.
4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.
5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.
6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.
7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.

I didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)

# Pro BB (QNX):

Developing an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).

# Conclusion

In my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).

Furthermore I just searched through job listings for ""QNX"" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).

Although Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.

l9mrpb,investing,"WSJ Exclusive: Exxon, Chevron CEOs Discussed Merger","This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:

* * *

The chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.

Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.

Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.

A combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.

But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.

One of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.

A handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron’s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips ’ roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.

Such a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.

It also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.

Many investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.

In an interview discussing Chevron’s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company’s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.

“As for larger scale things, it’s happened before,” Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. “Time will tell.”

Paul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.

Exxon was America’s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron’s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.

Exxon’s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron’s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.

Exxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.

Chevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet—in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.

Exxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Some investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon’s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.

Mr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon’s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.

Meanwhile, the company’s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon’s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.

Exxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.

Rivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven’t rewarded.

Exxon and Chevron haven’t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.

si5a51,investing,Fidelity has just released a paper about Bitcoin and why it should be be considered separately from other digital assets.,"**Why Investors Need to Consider Bitcoin Separately From Other Digital Assets**

[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-first)

Once investors have decided to invest in digital assets, the next question becomes, ""Which one?"" Of course, bitcoin is the most  recognized, first-ever digital asset, but there are hundreds and even  thousands of other digital assets in the ecosystem.

One of the first concerns investors have regarding bitcoin is as the  first digital asset it may be vulnerable to innovative destruction from  competitors (such as the story of MySpace and Facebook). Another common  consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same  potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital  assets that have emerged.

In this paper we propose:

* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the  primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in  an increasingly digital world.


* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No  other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good  because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure,  decentralized, sound digital money and any ""improvement"" will  necessarily face tradeoffs.


* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of  the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the  rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve  other problems that bitcoin simply does not.


* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.


* Bitcoin should be considered an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to digital assets.


* Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for  considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first  framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary  good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that exhibit venture capital-like properties.

87j51j,investing,My portfolio hit 500k!,"My goal is to retire early so it's nice to hit this milestone early on in my career.

I'm 33 and just about to celebrate my 10 year anniversary of being employed. Plan is to retire around 40-45 and then focus on my hobbies. 

I don't bring in a ridiculous salary but have had a high savings rate and good luck with returns. I'm frugal so I can maintain a decent savings rate despite living in a relatively expensive northeast suburb. My rent is $1850 as an example although I split that cost with my Fiancee. 

According to the ss.gov website, my gross income average since I started working has been $70254. I started at $45,000 when I graduated in 2008. It's doubled since then and now I can finally pump more money into individual accounts. It's pretty awesome to have a portfolio that's probably equal to my actual net income after taxes. The power of compounding!

I max out the 401k and Roth IRA each year with index funds. Index funds make up about 65% of my investment income and the rest is individual securities. I've had a great run with some individual picks that have driven results quite a bit(UNH, MKL are my two biggest holdings and I bought a bunch of UNH in the 20s all the way up to the 100s). I actually sold a bunch of UNH when it became too big a part of my portfolio in the 130s and now it soared all the way up to 220. Risk management can sometimes come at the expense of returns but I'd rather not how so much exposure to one stock. Still hold a good portion of their stock though and like the company. I've also played around with options a bit but in a very small way. Again most of my money is in index funds so my overall returns haven't been that far above the S&P 500 although I've eclipsed it a little bit. 

My strategy has been to follow a strict investment plan since I started although I only got serious about tracking my asset allocation closely in the past few years. My investment plan also allows me to hold up to 10% max in cash as part of my portfolio when I can't find any good deals out there. I always have money flowing into the market though via bi weekly 401k contributions. 

I'm pretty amped to get there so early due to the crazy bull market we've had and am not worried if there's a move in the other direction. I'm still likely 10+ years out and plan to keep pumping money in for a while so lower prices are better for me from a long term return perspective. 

Just wanted to say YAY and show everyone that it doesn't take a ton to make things work as long as you're consistent.

fol2gm,investing,Lawmakers agree to $2 trillion stimulus early morning,"Senior lawmakers and members of the Trump administration early Wednesday came to an agreement on a massive stimulus measure to try to keep Americans whole as the economy shuts down due to the coronavirus.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

Some bondholders said they did not receive coupon payments totalling US$148 million on Evergrande's April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 notes due by 0400 GMT on Tuesday, following two other payments it missed in September.

In the short term, the stock market is simply a voting machine based on how other investors are feeling that day. Emotions obviously get in the way and play a large role in the day to day pricing of stocks. 

But in the long term, stocks will always move towards their intrinsic value. The price of a stock will be weighted based on fundamental factors such as revenue growth, free cash flow, profit and gross margin etc. 

During times like this during the market when it may be tempting to sell everything or stop investing all together, it's important to keep a long time horizon and continue to DCA in companies that you fundamentally believe in.

mohir3,investing,Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s why,"Which is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.37 million in August and the unemployment rate tumbled to 8.4% as the U.S. economy continued to climb its way out of the pandemic downturn.

The unemployment rate was by far the lowest since the coronavirus shutdown in March, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting growth of 1.32 million and the jobless rate to decline to 9.8% from 10.2% in July.

Government hiring helped boost the total, with the growth of 344,000 workers accounting for a quarter of the monthly gain.

The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economic signals, with retail sales, real estate and manufacturing showing sharp rebounds off their coronavirus lows. Still, economists worry that absent another round of stimulus from Congress, the boosts in activity could be short-lived.

n3ollc,investing,Credit Suisse made just $17.5m in Archegos fees in year before $5.4bn losses,"edit: thought police have deemed this post as not worthy of being discussed and have locked the comments.

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

6qhp6r,investing,10 Years of Warren Buffett Book Recommendations,"I read through the past 10 years of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.

Each report is well worth reading (and re-reading).

Both Warren Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger often talk about how much they read.

Munger is famously quoted as saying:
>“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero.”

True to form, each Berkshire Hathaway report mentions a few books worth reading.

While a summer reading list or a “best books of the year” list is nothing new, a book recommendation means something entirely different when it comes from Warren Buffett.

Here are all the books that were recommended from 2006 to 2016 with quotes from the annual report on why Buffett picked each one.

# **2016 Annual Report**

* Shoe Dog by Phil Knight : *“Nike’s Phil Knight is a very wise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller.”*
* Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Celebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2nd Edition): *“The Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire’s first 50 years. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay.”*


# **2015 Annual Report**

* Limping on Water by Phil Beuth: *“An autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the best managerial duo – both in what they accomplished and how they did it – that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’ll never need a second exemplar.”*
* Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules by Jeremy Miller: *“A book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd. and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investment theory and practice, you will enjoy this book.""*

# **2014 Annual Report**

* Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders by Max Olson: *""Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965, and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive book commemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historical material, including documents from the 19th Century.”*
* Where Are the Customers’ Yachts by Fred Schwed: *“In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where Are the Customers’ Yachts’, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a caption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor are truly priceless.”*
* The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle: *“There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.”*
* Jim Ling by Chris Tucker, D Magazine: *“Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned earlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy Ling that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.”*

# **2013 Annual Report**

* Forty Chances by Howard Graham Buffett
* The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham: *“And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben’s book The Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase….Chapter Eight of Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one of the luckiest moments in my life.”*

# **2012 Annual Report**

* Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything by Carol Loomis: *“[Carol Loomis] has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977. She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the meeting.*
* The Outsiders by William Thorndike, Jr.: *“[The Outsiders] is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capital allocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I’ve ever met.”*
* The Clash of the Cultures by John Bogle
* Investing Between the Lines by L.J. Rittenhouse
* Unbeatable by Henry J. Cordes: *""Redblooded Husker fans – is there any Nebraskan who isn’t one? – will surely want to purchase Unbeatable. It tells the story of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne’s teams went 60-3.”*

# **2011 Annual Report**

* Jamie Dimon’s Annual Letters: *“One CEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I recommend that you read his annual letter.”*
* IBM’s Annual Reports: *“As was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I have been reading the company’s annual report for more than 50 years.”*
* MiTek by Jim Healey: *“I recommend MiTek, an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You’ll learn how my interest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose I couldn’t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 “tuck-in” acquisitions, almost all successful.”*
* A Few Lessons for Investors and Managers from Warren E. Buffett by Peter Bevelin: *“I think you’ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire’s investment and operating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and at annual meetings.”*

# **2010 Annual Report**

* Charles T. Munger (Chinese Edition) by Charles T. Munger: *“The Chinese language edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can’t read Chinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite.”*

# **2009 Annual Report**

* FRAGILE: The Human Condition by Howard G. Buffett: *“…a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle around the globe.”*
* Life Is What You Make It by Peter Buffett
* Giving It All Away: The Doris Buffett Story by Doris Buffett: *“Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my sister Doris’s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities.”*
* Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger by Charles T. Munger: *Also available will be Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle – never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site”*

# **2008 Annual Report**

I did not find any book recommendations listed for 2008.

# **2007 Annual Report**

No other recommendations besides Poor Charlie’s Almanack which I’ve included in 2009 since it was again mentioned there.

# **2006 Annual Report**	

* In Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin

“It’s a gambling parlor,” Mr. Buffett said Saturday of the markets over the past few years. He added that he blamed the financial industry for motivating risky behavior among investors. While he finds speculative bets “obscene,” the pickup in volatility across the markets has had one good effect, he said: It has allowed Berkshire to find undervalued businesses to invest in again following a period of relative quiet. 

Up until recently, Berkshire had largely been sitting on its cash pile. Its business thrived; a recovering economy and roaring stock market helped push net earnings to a record in 2021. But it didn’t announce any major deals, something that led many analysts and investors to wonder about its next moves. Berkshire ended the year with a near record amount of cash on hand. (After Berkshire’s buying spree, the size of the company’s war chest shrank to $106.26 billion at the end of the first quarter, from $146.72 billion three months earlier.)

Mr. Buffett’s feeling that there were no appealing investment opportunities for Berkshire quickly gave way to excitement in late February, he said Saturday, when he got a copy of Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon’s annual report.

Berkshire’s decision to build up a 14% stake in Occidental also came about with a report. Mr. Buffett said he had read an analyst note on the company, whose stock is still trading below its 2011 high, and decided the casino-like market conditions made it a good time to buy the stock.

“I don’t think we ever had anything quite like we have now in terms of the volumes of pure gambling activity going on daily,” Mr. Munger said. “It’s not pretty.” 

But the amount of speculation in the markets has given Berkshire a chance to spot undervalued businesses, Mr. Munger said, allowing the company to put its $106 billion cash reserve to work.

Neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Munger specifically addressed Berkshire’s decision to increase its Chevron stake.

But the two men offered a defense of the oil industry. It is a good thing for the U.S. to be producing more of its own oil, Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Munger went further, saying he could hardly think of a more useful industry.

The United States Oil fund, the largest oil ETF known as USO, saw inflows of about $1.5bn last week, as US crude prices hit their lowest levels since the early 2000s on plunging demand.   
>  
>Professional traders said retail investors, in particular, were trying to pick the turning point for oil, betting that the market will recover quickly once coronavirus-fighting measures are eased.  But prices had further to fall. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, crashed below zero for the first time in history, dropping as low as minus $40 as traders dumped the contract for delivery in May. The June contract, where most of USO’s investments currently sit, lost 15 per cent to about $21 a barrel.    
>  
>Investors are not just at risk of placing a wrong-way bet, traders say, as oil contracts do not trade like equities. Instead, they expire monthly so the underlying crude can be delivered to buyers — something specialists fear could be poorly understood by greenhorn investors.  “Investment in ETFs currently harbours high risks to investors who might be tempted to passively invest in oil due to ultra-low prices,” said Michel Salden, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Losses can occur when tracker funds have to “roll” their exposure when contracts expire, Mr Salden said.     
>  
>If the oil market structure shifts into “contango” — an industry term for when spot prices are trading below contracts for future delivery — then an ETF might have to sell its contracts at the lower price, then buy the next month’s contract at a higher price just to maintain its holdings.  Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy, said that the largest long-only oil ETFs had seen their net holdings rise by 400 per cent in the past month.   
>  
>These ETFs, he warned, “are predominantly positioned at the front of the futures curve and will be exposed to rolling losses every month until the market fundamentals eventually stabilise”.  That process “could take several months,” he added.  USO was the fourth most actively traded ETF in the US on Monday morning, with more than half a billion dollars changing hands before lunchtime in New York, as the WTI spot price plummeted.    
>  
>**Investors’ move into USO is reminiscent of 2009, when many investors bought the ETF as crude prices slipped to near $30 a barrel, before almost tripling over the next 12 months as the world economy emerged from the depths of the financial crisis. Investors found their ETF returns did not match the oil-price gains, as they had lost a large chunk of their investment each month through the process of rolling contracts.**  The USO fund, launched in 2006, typically absorbs cash from investors when crude prices hit bottom. Inflows previously peaked in early 2009 and in early 2016, just after oil-price crashes. Since March, the number of shares outstanding in the fund has doubled as new cash comes in.  
>  
>As of Friday, the fund held the equivalent of 146.5m barrels of WTI crude futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a division of CME Group. That was more than a quarter of the total open interest in the contract, exchange data showed.     
>  
>Nymex market rules impose “accountability levels” of 10m barrels equivalent for most US crude futures contracts, above which traders can be ordered to reduce their position. CME declined to comment on whether it had communicated with USO.  The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a government regulator, has proposed a 6m-barrel limit on individual fund positions in US crude on the brink of delivery, but refrained from setting caps for positions in contracts for delivery later on.    
>  
>Some traders say the USO fund is big enough to exacerbate price moves between different contract months as it rolls out of one position and into another. “That definitely can put downward pressure on the market,” said Joe Raia, a former senior executive in energy futures at Nymex and Goldman Sachs.     
>  
>USO announced last Thursday that it was moving 20 per cent of the WTI contracts it holds into later months, in a move widely believed to have been influenced by the blowout in the spread between crude prices.  The position “just got to the size where it makes sense to spread it out,” said John Love, chief executive of US Commodity Funds, which runs the USO fund, on Friday.   
>  
>The USO next rolls its contracts on May 5 to May 8. The fund extended that process to four days early last decade to make it harder for other traders to front-run its moves.  Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York

Ok. So I lied. This post was getting way too long, so I had to split in two (3a and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/))

In the previous posts [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdft5z/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_1_of_4/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/), I explained how to buy and sell options, and how their price is calculated and evolves over time depending on the share price, volatility, and days to expiration.

In this post 3a (and the next [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/)), I am going to explain in more detail how and when you can use multiple contracts together to create more profitable trades in various market conditions.

Just a reminder of the building blocks:

You expect that, by expiration, the stock price will …

... go up more than the premium you paid → Buy a call

… go down more than the premium you paid → Buy a put

... not go up more than the premium you got paid → Sell a call

... not go down more than the premium you got paid → Sell a put

**Buying Straight Calls:**

But why would you buy calls to begin with? Why not just buy the underlying shares? Conversely, why would you buy puts? Why not just short the underlying shares?

Let’s take long shares and long calls as an example, but this applies with puts as well.

If you were to buy 100 shares of the company ABC currently trading at $20. You would have to spend $2000. Now imagine that the share price goes up to $25, you would now have $2500 worth of shares. Or a 25% profit.

If you were convinced that the price would go up, you could instead buy call options ATM or OTM. For example, an ATM call with a strike of $20 might be worth $2 per share, so $200 per contract. You buy 10 contracts for $2000, so the same cost as buying 100 shares. Except that this time, if the share price hits $25 at expiration, each contract is now worth $500, and you now have $5000, for a $3000 gain, or a 150% profit. You could even have bought an OTM call with a strike of $22.50 for a lower premium and an even higher profit.

But it is fairly obvious that this method of buying calls is a good way to lose money quickly. When you own shares, the price goes up and down, but as long as the company does not get bankrupt or never recovers, you will always have your shares. Sometimes you just have to be very patient for the shares to come back (buying an index ETF increases your chances there). But by buying $2000 worth of calls, if you are wrong on the direction, the amplitude, or the time, those options become worthless, and it’s a 100% loss, which rarely happens when you buy shares.

Now, you could buy only one contract for $200. Except for the premium that you paid, you would have a similar profit curve as buying the shares outright. You have the advantage though that if the stock price dropped to $15, instead of losing $500 by owning the shares, you would only lose the $200 you paid for the premium. However, if you lose these $200 the first month, what about the next month? Are you going to bet $200 again, and again… You can see that buying calls outright is not scalable long term. You need a very strong conviction over a specific period of time.

**How to buy cheaper shares? Sell Cash Covered Put.**

Let’s continue on the example above with the company ABC trading at $20. You may think that it is a bit expensive, and you consider that $18 is a more acceptable price for you to own that company.

You could sell a put ATM with a $20 strike, for $2. Your break-even point would be $18, i.e. you would start losing money if the share price dropped below $18. But also remember that if you did buy the shares outright, you would have lost more money in case of a price drop, because you did not get a premium to offset that loss. If the price stays above $20, your return for the month will be 11% ($200 / $1800).

Note that in this example, we picked the ATM strike of $20, but you could have picked a lower strike for your short put, like an OTM strike of $17.50. Sure, the premium would be lower, maybe $1 per share, but your break-even point would drop from $18 to $16.50 (only 6% return then per month, not too shabby).

The option trade will usually be written like this:

SELL -1 ABC 100 17 JUL 20 17.5 PUT @ 1.00

This means we sold 1 PUT on ABC, 100 shares per contract, the expiration date is July 17, 2020, and the strike is $17.5, and we sold it for $1 per share (so $100 credit minus fees).

With your $20 short put, you will get assigned the shares if the price drops below $20 and you keep it until expiration, however, you will have paid them the equivalent of $18 each (we’ll actually talk more about the assignment later). If your short put expires worthless, you keep the premium, and you may decide to redo the same trade again. The share price may have gone up so much that the new ATM strike does not make you comfortable, and that’s fine as you were not willing to spend more than $18 per share, to begin with, anyway. You will have to wait for some better conditions.

This strategy is called a cash covered put. In a taxable account, depending on your broker, you can have it on margin with no cash needed (you will need to have some other positions to provide the buying power). Beware that if you don’t have the cash to cover the shares, it is adding some leverage to your overall position. **Make sure you account for all your potential risks at all times.** The nice thing about this position is that as long as you are not assigned, you don’t actually need to borrow some money, it won’t cost you anything. In an IRA account, you will need to have the cash available for the assignment (remember in this example, you only need $1800, plus trading fees).

**Let’s roll!**

Now one month later, the share price is between $18 and $22, there are few days of expiration left, and you don’t want to be assigned, but you want to continue the same process for next month. You could close the current position, and reopen a new short put, or you could in one single transaction buy back your current short put, and sell another put for next month. Doing one trade instead of two is usually cheaper because you reduce the slippage cost. The closing of the old position and re-opening of a new short position for the next expiration is called rolling the short option (from month to month, but you can also do this with weekly options).

The croll can be done a week or even a few days before expiration. Remember to avoid expiration days, and be careful being short an option on ex-dividend dates. When you roll month to month with the same strike, for most cases, you will get some money out of it. However, the farther your strike is from the current share price, the less additional premium you will get (due to the lower extrinsic value on the new option), and it can end up being close to $0. At that point, given the risk incurred, you may prefer to close the trade altogether or just be assigned. During the roll, depending on if the share price moved a bit, you can adjust the roll up or down. For example, you buy back your short put at $18, and you sell a new short put at $17 or $19, or whatever value makes the most sense.

**Assignment**

Now, let’s say that the share price finally dropped below $20, and you decided not to roll, or it dropped so much that the roll would not make sense. You ended up getting your shares assigned at a strike price of $18 per share. Note that the assigned share may have a current price much lower than $18 though. If that’s the case, remember that you earned more money than if you bought the shares outright at $20 (at least, you got to keep the $2 premium). And if you rolled multiple times, every premium that you got is additional money in your account.

**Want to sell at a premium? Sell Covered Calls.**

You could decide to hold onto the shares that you got at a discount, or you may decide that the stock price is going to go sideways, and you are fine collecting more theta. For example, you could sell a call at a strike of $20, for example for $1 (as it is OTM now given the stock price dropped).

SELL -1 ABC 100 17 JUL 20 20 CALL @ 1.00

When close to the expiration time, you can either roll your calls again, the same way that you rolled your puts, as much as you can, or just get assigned if the share price went up. As you get assigned, your shares are called away, and you receive $2000 from the 100 shares at $20 each. Except that you accumulated more money due to all the premiums you got along the way.

This sequence of the short put, roll, roll, roll, assignment, the short call, roll, roll, roll, is called the wheel.

It is a great strategy to use when the market is trading sideways and volatility is high (like currently). It is a low-risk trade provided that the share you pick is not a risky one (pick a market ETF to start) perfect to get create some income with options. There are two drawbacks though:

* If the share dropped too much, you are stuck with it.

You will have to be patient for the share to go back up, but often you can end up with many shares at a loss if the market has been tanking. As a rule of thumb, if I get assigned, I never ever sell a call below my assignment strike minus the premium. In case the market jumps back up, I can get back to my original position, with an additional premium on the way. Market and shares can drop like a stone and bounce back up very quickly (you remember this March and April?), and you really don’t want to lock a loss.

Here is a very quick example of something to not do: Assigned at $18, current price is $15, sell a call at $16 for $1, share goes back up to $22. I get assigned at $16. In summary, I bought a share at $18, and sold it at $17 ($16 + $1 premium), I lost $1 between the two assignments. That’s bad.

* If the share goes up too fast, you missed some opportunity for gain, potentially big gains.

You will have to find some other companies to do the wheel on. If it softens the blow a bit, your retirement account may be purely long, so you’ll not have totally missed the upside anyway.

A short put is a bullish position. A short call is a bearish position. Alternating between the two gives you a strategy looking for a reversion to the mean. Both of these positions are positive theta, and negative vega (see part 2).

Now that I explained the advantage of the long calls and puts, and how to use short calls and puts, we can explore a combination of both.

**Verticals**

Most option beginners are going to use long calls (or even puts). They are going to gain some money here and there, but for most parts, they will lose money. It is worse if they profited a bit at the beginning, they became confident, bet a bigger amount, and ended up losing a lot. They either buy too much (50% of my account on this call trade that can’t fail), too high of a volatility (got to buy those NKLA calls or puts), or too short / too long of an expiration (I don’t want to lose theta, or I overspent on theta).

As we discussed earlier, a straight long call or put is one of the worst positions to be in. You are significantly negative theta and positive vega. But if you take a step back, you will realize that not accounting for the premium, buying a call gives you the upside of stock up to the infinity (and buying a put gives you the upside of the stock going to $0). But in reality, you rarely are betting that the stock will go to infinity (or to $0). You are often just betting that the stock will go up (or down) by X%. Although the stock could go up (or down) by more than X%, you intuitively understand that there is a smaller chance for this to happen. Options are giving you leverage already, you don’t need to target even more gain.

**More importantly, you probably should not pay for a profit/risk profile that you don’t think is going to happen.**

Enter verticals. It is a combination of long and short calls (or puts). Say, the company ABC trades at $20, you want to take a bullish position, and the ATM call is $2. You probably would be happy if the stock reaches $25, and you don’t think that it will go much higher than that.

You can buy a $20 call for $2, and sell a $25 call for $0.65. You will get the upside from $20 to $25, and you let someone else take the $25 to infinity range (highly improbable). The cost is $1.35 per share ($2.00 - $0.65).

BUY +1 VERTICAL ABC 100 17 JUL 20 20/25 CALL @ 1.35

This position is interesting for multiple reasons. First, you still get the most probable range for profitability ($20 to $25). Your cost is $1.35 so 33% cheaper than the long call, and your max profit is $5 - $1.35 = $3.65. So your max gain is 270% of the risked amount, and this is for only a 25% increase in the stock price. This is really good already. You reduced your dependency on theta and vega, because the short side of the vertical is reducing your long side’s. You let someone else pay for it.

Another advantage is that it limits your max profit, and it is not a bad thing. Why is it a good thing? Because it is too easy to be greedy and always wanting and hoping for more profit. The share reached $25. What about $30? It reached $30, what about $35? Dang it dropped back to $20, I should have sold everything at the top, now my call expires worthless. But with a vertical, you know the max gain, and you paid a premium for an exact profit/risk profile. As soon as you enter the vertical, you could enter a close order at 90% of the max value (buy at $1.35, sell at $4.50), good till to cancel, and you hope that the trade will eventually be executed. It can only hit 100% profit at expiration, so you have to target a bit less to get out as soon as you can once you have a good enough profit. This way you lock your profit, and you have no risk anymore in case the market drops afterwards.

These verticals (also called spreads) can be bullish or bearish and constructed as debit (you pay some money) or credit (you get paid some money). The debit or credit versions are equivalent, the credit version has a bit of a higher chance to get assigned sooner, but as long as you check the extrinsic value, ex-dividend date, and are not too deep ITM you will be fine. I personally prefer getting paid some money, I like having a bigger balance and never have to pay for margin. :)

Here are the 4 trades for a $20 share price:

CALL BUY 20 ATM / SELL 25 OTM - Bullish spread - Debit

CALL BUY 25 OTM / SELL 20 ATM - Bearish spread - Credit

PUT BUY 20 ATM / SELL 25 ITM - Bullish spread - Credit

PUT BUY 25 ITM / SELL 20 ATM - Bearish spread - Debit

Because both bullish trades are equivalent, you will notice that they both have the same profit/risk profile (despite having different debit and credit prices due to the OTM/ITM differences). Same for the bearish trades. Remember that the cost of an ITM option is greater than ATM, which in turn is greater than an OTM. And that relationship is what makes a vertical a credit or a debit.

I understand that it can be a lot to take in. Let’s take a step back here. I picked a $20/$25 vertical, but with the share price at $20, I could have a similar $5 spread with $15/$20 (with the same 4 constructs). Or instead of 1 vertical $20/$25, I could have bought 5 verticals $20/$21. This is a $5 range as well, except that it has a higher probability for the share to be above $21. However, it also means that the spread will be more expensive (you’ll have to play with your broker tool to understand this better), and it also increases the trading fees and potentially overall slippage, as you have 5 times more contracts. Or you could even decide to pick OTM $25/$30, which would be even cheaper. In this case, you don’t need the share to reach $30 to get a lot of profit. The contracts will be much cheaper (for example, like $0.40 per share), and if the share price goes up to $25 quickly long before expiration, the vertical could be worth $1.00, and you would have 150% of profit without the share having to reach $30.

If you decide to trade these verticals the first few times, look a lot at the numbers before you trade to make sure you are not making a mistake. With a debit vertical, the most you can lose per contract is the premium you paid. With a credit vertical, the most you can lose is the difference between your strikes, minus the premium you received.

**One last but important note about verticals:**

If your short side is too deep ITM, you may be assigned. It happens. If you bought some vertical with a high strike value, for example:

SELL +20 VERTICAL SPY 100 17 JUL 20 350/351 PUT @ 0.95

Here, not accounting for trading fees and slippage, you paid $0.95 per share for 20 contracts that will be worth $1 per share if SPY is less than $350 by mid-July, which is pretty certain. That’s a 5% return in 4 weeks (in reality, the trading fees are going to reduce most of that). Your actual risk on this trade is $1900 (20 contracts \* 100 shares \* $0.95) plus trading fees. That’s a small trade, however the underlying instrument you are controlling is much more than that.

Let’s see this in more detail: You enter the trade with a $1900 potential max loss, and you get assigned on the short put side (strike of $350) after a few weeks. Someone paid expensive puts and exercised 20 puts with a strike of $350 on their existing SPY shares (2000 of them, 20 contracts \* 100 shares). You will suddenly receive 2000 shares on your account, that you paid $350 each. Thus your balance is going to show -$700,000 (you have 2000 shares to balance that).

If that happens to you: **DON’T PANIC. BREATHE. YOU ARE FINE.**

You owe $700k to your broker, but you have roughly the same amount in shares anyway. You are STILL protected by your long $351 puts. If the share price goes up by $1, you gain $2000 from the shares, but your long $351 put will lose $2000. Nothing changed. If the share price goes down by $1, you lose $2000 from the shares, but your long $350 put will gain $2000. Nothing changed. Just close your position nicely by selling your shares first, and just after selling your puts. Some brokers can do that in one single trade (put based covered stock). Don’t let the panic set in. Remember that you are hedged. Don’t forget about the slippage, don’t let the market makers take advantage of your panic. Worst case scenario, if you use a quality broker with good customer service, call them, and they will close your position for you, especially if this happens in an IRA.

The reason I am insisting so much on this is because of last week’s [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss). Yes, the RH platform may have shown incorrect numbers for a while, but before you trade options you need to understand the various edge cases. Again if this happens to you, don’t panic, breathe, and please be safe.

This concludes my post 3a. We talked about the trade-offs between buying shares, buying calls instead, selling puts to get some premium to buy some shares at a cheaper price, rolling your short puts, getting your puts assigned, selling calls to get some additional money in sideways markets, rolling your short calls, having your calls assigned too. We talked about the wheel, being this whole sequence spanning multiple months. After that, we discussed the concept of verticals, with bullish and bearish spreads that can be either built as a debit or a credit.

And if there is one thing you need to learn from this, avoid buying straight calls or puts but use verticals instead, especially if the volatility is very high. And do not ever sell naked calls, again use verticals.

frly40,investing,Oil is now under $20 a barrel. This obviously is temporary. How would I invest in this long-term?,"Crude hit $19.92 a barrel in the US just now. 

Like in 2015, this price crash is an obvious temporary reaction to a perfect storm, and crude obviously isn't going to stay at historic lows for long.

What I'm asking is;

1) How is it so long, when the long term value of oil is profoundly unlikely to be permanently damaged

2) If it is indeed rational to invest in Oil long-term at this price, how do I do so? I am UK based if that helps.

I made a post two weeks ago about an idea I had and a lot of people were interested.  Basically, my friend and I built a screener that selects the stocks that rank highest in momentum (12m-1m price return), quality (high ROA, low D/E) and value (low P/E, PB, P/CF, P/S).  We built the screener because finviz and others do not let you select the stocks that are in the top 10% cheapest and 10% highest momentum.  We have the data for global stocks, but I decided to make my first post about US stocks only.

So here's the list of the 10 stocks ranking highest in momentum, value and quality (There were 25 stocks in my screener but I took the 10 stocks with the highest momentum):

&#x200B;

|Name|Ticker|D/E Ratio|Price Return 12m -1m|P/E Ratio|ROA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc.|SPWH|1.56|\+190%|10.34|10.62%|
|Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.|LL|1.19|\+187%|15.29|8.16%|
|Educational Development Corporation|EDUC|0.29|\+168%|11.86|15.44%|
|Escalade, Inc.|ESCA|0.23|\+157%|10.59|17.43%|
|MarineMax, Inc.|HZO|0.67|\+154%|11.08|10.67%|
|Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.|NUS|0.50|\+145%|13.60|10.82%|
|Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.|MDRX|0.17|\+118%|3.48|21.85%|
|Williams-Sonoma, Inc.|WSM|1.10|\+118%|18.70|13.57%|
|SIFCO Industries, Inc.|SIF|0.81|\+117%|3.58|12.13%|
|Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.|HVT|0.92|\+109%|11.14|10.56%|

&#x200B;

Obvisouly, no one should buy any of these stocks only because they rank well in a few metrics, but I feel like weekly/monthly discussions about the stocks ranking highest in different ratios could be interesting for investors.  Also, most of these stocks are small caps that aren't known by many, so it's a great way to learn about new companies.

If you have any question/suggestion, please let me know!",2021-03-02 01:57:29,2024-02-25 22:33:00.268143,1090 days 20:35:31.268144,220,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvr5rl/list_of_stocks_ranking_highest_in_momentum/

ulvwmh,investing,Anyone else find this downturn legitimately depressing?,"I’ve lost $35K since November and am down like $25K lifetime due to dumping a lot into stocks after I got bonuses in December.  I just find it depressing that I could have never saved/invested and instead burned $35K on living a luxurious life for many months, and I’d be in the same financial position I am in today.  

I know things should bounce back eventually, but I’ve now lost as much money as I’ve made in some years (a long time ago).  Just makes me sad; I feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot to earn and save what I have, and it feels worthless right now (because I’m literally worse off than my friends who just spent their money on luxuries and/or haven’t bothered to invest).

**Edit:**  This post took off way more than I expected; it was really just meant to be an anonymous rant into the void on a bad day!  I am not suggesting that it would actually have been wiser to blow money on luxuries than to invest.  And I am fully aware of what it means for a loss to be unrealized.  But the following is mathematically true:  If I liquidated my portfolio in November, spent $35K on luxuries between that day and the day of my post, and then on the day of my post I bought back into the market with my remaining cash, I would have the exact same assets and net worth as I did in reality.  That is a fact.  And it's a fact that I found sad, because *with the benefit of hindsight, knowing exactly what the market would do*, it would in fact have been better to spend the $35K on luxuries.  But in reality, we never know exactly when the market will tank, so, in reality, it would not make sense to choose luxuries over investing.  Nothing in my post is meant to suggest investing is a bad idea; you can't time the market and you have to accept that the value of your assets will drop sometimes.",2022-05-09 17:03:09,2024-02-25 22:33:00.268171,657 days 05:29:51.268172,1148,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ulvwmh/anyone_else_find_this_downturn_legitimately/
mlccw1,investing,"Fidelity, Square, Coinbase Launch Bitcoin Trade Group","Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

The Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research projects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s voice in championing the economic benefits of digital currencies and related technologies. Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

mve8vh,investing,"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial Forecasts","Netflix reported 208 million global subscribers as of the end of the first quarter, missing its own prediction for 210 million.


The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

11zjdx3,investing,Hindenburg Research announce that Block Inc. ($SQ) are overstating user counts and understating customer acquisition costs,"Full report: [Block: How Inflated User Metrics and “Frictionless” Fraud Facilitation Enabled Insiders To Cash Out Over $1 Billion](https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/)

Some selected points:

* Our 2-year investigation has concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping. The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.

* Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

* Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

* Even when users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user. A former customer service rep shared screenshots showing how blacklisted accounts were regularly associated with dozens or hundreds of other active accounts suspected of fraud. This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip hop songs.

* Block obfuscates how many individuals are on the Cash App platform by reporting misleading “transacting active” metrics filled with fake and duplicate accounts. Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.

* Beyond facilitating payments for criminal activity, the platform has been overrun with scam accounts and fake users, according to numerous interviews with former employees.

* The data shows that compared to its Ohio competitor, Cash App’s partner bank had nearly 10x the number of applicants who applied for benefits through a bank account used by another claimant – a clear red flag of fraud.

* Block reported a pandemic surge in user counts and revenue, ignoring the contribution of widespread fraudulent accounts and payments. The new business provided a sharp one-time increase to Block’s stock, which rose 639% in 18 months during the pandemic.

* In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.

* We also believe Jack Dorsey has built an empire—and amassed a $5 billion personal fortune—professing to care deeply about the demographics he is taking advantage of. With Dorsey and top executives already having sold over $1 billion in equity on Block’s meteoric pandemic run higher, they have ensured they will be fine, regardless of the outcome for everyone else.",2023-03-23 12:49:45,2024-02-25 22:33:00.268220,339 days 09:43:15.268220,326,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11zjdx3/hindenburg_research_announce_that_block_inc_sq/
hy3mgo,investing,Why is Intel losing to AMD & people just realized it now?,"Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)

When you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electrical engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?

Intel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map & product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.

This also separates the difference between value investing & growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.

There will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues & earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.

None of these promises have ever happened, of course, and with this week's forced retrenchment, likely never will.
> 
> Severe and unsustainable cash losses have forced UBER to ratchet back its strategic ambitions; to raise another $1.0BN of junk bonds at a steep 7.5%, and reduce on-the-books headcount by at least 25%. UBER will likely cut its ""non-core"" businesses, including freight, autonomous vehicles, flying cars, artificial intelligence, and job matching. These businesses, together, were the secret sauce that was to turn a simple and old-fashioned taxi-hailing app into the next big thing, rivaling Amazon in the scope and reach of its operations. These promises were what drew investors as big as Texas Pacific Group and Softbank in at valuations north of $70BN and even promised to approach $100BN - for a business that, in the here and now, is only able to generate revenues of $14BN, with growth slowing sharply, while margins remain massively negative, and billions of cash losses pile up - and that best case was pre-COVID!
> 
> Now, UBER faces a sharply diminished TAM, or total addressable market, as it gives up its ambitions to expand beyond taxi-hailing and food delivery, and major American and international corporations in various industries, including technology, media, real estate, airlines, hotels, and entertainment destinations all prepare us for a world of sharply diminished transportation needs. Where workers will shift to permanently working from home; where international travel will be diminished for years; where even domestic destination travel will face diminished capacity and utilization.
> 
> None of this has yet sunk into the minds of equity market investors.
> 
> THESIS
> 
> Diminution of Total Addressable Market. Uber is likely abandoning its ambitions to be a leader and create a revenue generating business in nearly every area besides its core taxi-hail and food delivery business. These early-non-core businesses, while inchoate and pre-revenue, gave investors hope that UBER was not just an old-fashioned transportation company making use of the latest technology - smartphone apps - but an actual technology company, with the same opportunity for horizontal expansion as Amazon. This hope was among the reasons why a negative cash burn of several billion dollars for a seemingly mundane business could turn into a $59 BN valuation. That hope is gone.

> For its remaining core business, taxi-hail, the world has changed:
> 
> Negative Secular Changes to UBER’s Core Business
> 
> First, we start with the massive secular change we are witnessing in the American workplace. Then, we move on to the lengthy and even semi-permanent changes to restaurants and travel.
> 
> We are witnessing a generational acceleration in work-from-home, in which commuting to and from work is facing the biggest and fastest change in its history. Companies such as Google, Square, and Twitter are preparing for a future in which employees may work remotely – forever. Others such as Facebook, JP Morgan, Citibank, American Express and Microsoft have taken steps in this direction. Employees who commuted to these workplace jobs were often customers of UBER. Many of these customers and their ""rideshare"" business won’t come back. Here is a sampling of recent headlines that will negatively impact UBER - for at least several quarters in some cases, permanently in others:
> 
> First, Twitter. This one is permanent:
> 
> 
> 
> Next, we have Square, also offering permanence:
> 
> 
> 
> Now, we turn to Facebook, who for now, is only planning until the end of the year:
> 
> 
> 
> Now we will shift to the banks, which are not only continuing work from home, but also seeking semi-permanent shifts away from urban centers, another hit to UBER's business:
> 
> 
> 
> Citi is but one example; the list goes on and on, and is only growing by the day.
> 
> Next, we have buy in to work from home from the media, who indicate that working from home is the right thing to do:
> 
> 
> 
> And the NY Times weighs in on the nascent trend:
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> We also have consultancies now adding their voices to the chorus of work from home:
> 
> Surveys also indicate there is a new and growing movement for work-from-home accommodations. Global Workplace Analytics, a leading authority on integrated work at home strategies, recently published a report in which they forecast that as much as 25-30% of the workforce will be working from home by the end of 2021. See the full report here:

> Work-at-Home After Covid-19-Our Forecast - Global Workplace Analytics
> 
> These are the thought leaders. We are witnessing a tsunami of potentially permanently lost taxi-hail business for these former commuters. While some of the headlines may say only through 2020, these arrangements are likely to be made permanent in many cases.
> 
> And now, the rest of the ride-share customer universe: the restaurant, travel and leisure industry have been decimated, with full year 2020 volumes estimated to be down anywhere from nearly 20% (fast food) to 40% (hotels) to more than 50% (airlines and certain destination-based entertainment.)
> 
> Obviously, none of these industries by themselves comprise UBER's exact customer base, but taken collectively, they are representative of what has happened to the total addressable market: it is severely impaired.
> 
> Selected Peer Group Performance 2020
> 
> Throughout the latest strategy retreat, 25% work force reduction, revenue collapse, junk debt capital raise, and multi-billion dollar cash burn, one thing stands out: UBER’s high flying stock, which has surged this week along with the NASDAQ market to a new high for the year of $59 billion, now up 16% on the year. Stated another way, stock buyers have treated COVID-19 and its catastrophic impact on UBER’s revenues and margins as a net positive catalyst. This stands in stark contrast to the many other companies operating in and round UBER’s universe, including hotels, airlines, lodging, office space, and even other “unicorns"".
> 
> We highlight the 2020 changes in valuation of numerous companies that derive revenues from similar underlying strategic drivers as UBER: commuting to work, commuting to airports, commuting to leisure activities, commuting to restaurants and bars, and commuting to vacation. We lay out the year to date equity returns, followed by consensus changes to 2020 forecast revenues. Every data point indicates UBER’s valuation change is completely inconsistent with its related peer group.
> 
> First, we frame UBER’s equity valuation change year to date, along with the consensus expectation for 2020 Revenues, and list how they have changed, showing the January 1, 2020 consensus estimate, followed by the current 2020 consensus estimate.
> 
> As you can see, UBER is up 16% year to date, while its 2020E Revenue expectations have been reduced by 29%.
> 
> 
> 
> Then, we turn to the various comparably impacted industries, as described above. We start with Airlines, as airports are a primary source and destination of UBER customers, and note the average hit to airline valuation has been 66%, while the average expected hit to revenues in 2020 has been 56%.
> 
> 
> 
> Next, we look at Hotels, a common destination and origin for UBER customers, where you can see the average hotel has taken a 39% valuation hit, while the expected revenue decline is 40%.
> 
> 
> 
> Office REITS, which we also use as a proxy of demand for commuting to work, have seen an average 42% decline in valuation, with only a 5% hit to revenues. Here, the financial forecasts are out of sync with the change in valuation. Even the out years look similar. Expect the numbers to come down, significantly.
> 
> 
> 
> Restaurants are a large and fractured group, and we chose McDonalds as simply a directional indicator:
> 
> 
> 
> And finally, the still-private “unicorns”, who bear much structural similarity to UBER, particularly AirBnB which also was forced to fire 25% of its work force, and to reduce its strategic scope to “core” operations while giving up on growth opportunities. Here, you will see that AirBnB recently took a 52.6% hit to its private market valuation since 2019, and WeWork took a 60% hit to its December 2019 valuation (which was itself an 84% hit to its January 2019 valuation). AirBnB’s CEO also wrote a letter that sounds nearly identical to UBER’s CEO “I’m-sorry-but-you’re-fired, our business is collapsing” letter.
> 
> 
> 
> The overall context should be clear: UBER's entire ecosystem has experienced a volume and valuation collapse compared to UBER's year to date double digit stock price growth. This stock price growth is inconsistent with the underlying data.
> 
> We specifically concede that none of these companies are perfect comparables, but all derive revenues from a similar ecosystem: the home-work-travel-leisure nexus, and their customers must be transported somehow to their offices, their hotels, their airports, and their leisure AirBnB vacations. Together, they paint a picture: UBER’s equity price has largely ignored the reality of a collapsed ecosystem, and is the only related equity that not only has not collapsed, but is actually UP double digits on the year.
> 
> Will UBER’s business come back? Absolutely, some of it will come back. The travel/airline/hotel transport nexus actually has the highest probability of coming back, but the longest lead time. These won’t see even a near-full recovery for several years, in line with forecasts for hotel and airlines revenue. The most at risk revenue is actually related to work commuting: many employers are in the process of shifting to permanent work-from-home arrangements. UBER will never recover this revenue. Much of the work commute revenue IS NEVER COMING BACK. Thus, UBER's TAM has shrunk.
> 
> UBER's Core, or The Remaining Businesses
> 
> What do the taxi-hail, or Rides, and Eats businesses really look like on a stand-alone basis? What are they worth?
> 
> UBER shows a separate revenue and ""adjusted"" EBITDA figure for each of its remaining core businesses.
> 
> Here is a snapshot of historical revenue breakdown:
> 
> As you can see, the Rides business represents 72% of total revenues, and its growth has flat-lined near zero. Now, this included 2 weeks post-COVID shutdown, so we can assume it may have been able to reach a positive low single digit growth number. Eats grew at a low double digit number, and represents around 19% of total revenue.
> 
> EBITDA is not as straightforward, as many adjustments and exclusions are made. What we know with certainty is that the consolidated business produced negative $2.468 billion of EBITDA for the last 12 months. As for segments, UBER shows a positive $2.460 billion of Rides EBITDA, but that excludes more than $4.0 billion of stock-based compensation, and it also excludes more than $2.5 billion of un-allocated corporate overhead. See worksheet below:
> 
> 
> 
> The exclusions are of such a magnitude as to render the supposed $2.46 billion of EBITDA to be nearly meaningless. Could they have generated this without paying out $4.0 billion in stock compensation? Did the $2.5 billion spent on general and administrative, and R&D have any impact on the Rides business? Of course it did. These numbers can no more be excluded than any business can disown its business expenses!
> 
> So we have a 11-year old business whose top line growth has settled in around a low single digit number that currently loses $2.5 billion a year in consolidated EBITDA. Should they cut $1.0 billion of costs, that is helpful, but the enterprise would still be losing more than $1.0 billion on an adjusted-EBITDA basis. The Eats business loses money and remains hyper-competitive. It is likely to continue to lose money for the foreseeable future.
> 
> So where could UBER's EBITDA number go? This is difficult to say. UBER is hoping to break even on an adjusted-EBITDA basis sometime next year. While I am doubtful that will happen, even it it did, we would have a low growth business in a highly competitive market that at some point in the future could grow that break-even EBITDA into a billion or a few billion of EBITDA. What is that worth? We can look at a range, but unless growth suddenly shoots back into the 20% range or higher, its hard to see a slow growing EBITDA in such a simple business with no barriers to entry commanding a double digit EBITDA valuation multiple. Let's call the midpoint 10x. So 10x 2022E or 2023E EBITDA of $1.0 or $2.0 billion is $10 - $20 billion of enterprise value. And remember, that while UBER can shut down much of its non-core growth/upside assets, it can not simply get rid of its $9BN debt pile, including the recently raised $1.0 billion of junk debt that pays a steep 7.5% coupon.
> 
> If we generously ignore the Eats losses, assume net debt in 2 years will be maybe $4 - $6 billion, and the share count remains the same (which is overly conservative), then we are left with the following valuation, which indicates an equity value that ranges from $2 to $11:
> 
> $ billions

> The market is wrongly ascribing a $59 billion equity valuation for a Company that is collapsing its workforce, reigning in its growth ambitions, and signaling much diminished growth in the future, while it bleeds down cash to the tune of more than $5BN a year. It is faced with a nearly insurmountable $9 Billion junk debt pile.

ghxwi6,investing,Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO,"In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that’s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.

Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.

Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.

“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.

The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.


Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.

“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.

Futures positioning shows investors still doubt S&P 500 rebound

But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.

“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.

relates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.

Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.

The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

j7dpsp,investing,Activist investor Dan Loeb urges Disney to suspend dividend and redirect the funds to its streaming service Disney+.," **What is Happening?**

Activist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb's Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney. 

*Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.* 

**Why does this Matter?**

Disney's stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.   


Right now the company's only bright spot is Disney+. It attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.   


Loeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+'s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.   


**The Takeaway:**   
Initially, it might seem scary to take away that 1.43% dividend yield from shareholders; however, Loeb is not completely crazy. Dividends are just one way a company can choose to ""allocate capital/profits"". As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends to this high growth project. In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend. ",2020-10-08 14:10:21,2024-02-25 22:33:00.268268,1235 days 08:22:39.268269,265,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j7dpsp/activist_investor_dan_loeb_urges_disney_to/

it176s,investing,Sony reduces PS5 production by 26.7% due to AMD chip issue," According to Bloomberg, there is a low yield issue with the SOC chip in PS5 (as low as 50% yield). As the result, Sony will have to cut its PS5 production by 26.7%. As we know, AMD provides those SOC chips (custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and custom GPU based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture), and those chips are manufactured with TSMC 7nm process.

Since AMD's upcoming Zen 3 and Big Navi also use TSMC 7nm, will there be yield issue for Zen 3 and Big Navi too? Probably yes.

Will this cause AMD and TSMC stocks to drop? Maybe.

If we keep seeing news like this coming out in the next few weeks, obviously it's not good for any of these companies. So take this into consideration for your next play - don't just YOLO thinking the market has finally turned around.

Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",2020-12-20 23:00:10,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275129,1161 days 23:32:52.275129,381,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kh4fza/congress_agrees_to_900_billion_coronavirus/
g53z9h,investing,Todays Negative Oil is Economically Devastating,"At the height of trading today, /CLK20 hit -$40.32. This means someone was willing to pay you $40,320 per contract to take 1000 barrels deliverd. Seems great and all, everyone gets paid, you store them in your garage or whatever, but there is an underlying issue here... storage.

Generally, retail paper traders are not trading this contract, most brokerages won’t even allow you to trade the front month after last week. You would be forced to trade the forward (June) /CLM20 or later. People trading today are actual physical buyers and sellers, large companies needing to move physical oil. For it to go negative means a lot of people were on the phones calling around trying to find space to store said oil, and they couldn’t find the space for that oil, which drove the price negative just so they could unload the contract. Who cares right? 

We should all care... why? [Government has extended DoD Travel Ban to June 30](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/04/dod-to-extend-stop-movement-order-through-june-30/) so you can be sure if they are banning non essential travel through June 30 they are likely going to ban people from coming into the work place (that cube life, the resurgence of COVID)... Travel by plane and commuting to work... the two biggest reasons for oil/gas... They have been on hold for about 1.5 months and now the government is stating that they will be on hold for another 2 months at least. Now lets not even talk about heating oil needed for the northern areas coming into spring… 

You cant keep pumping oil if you have no demand for it, and you have no place to store it, although the later is more important. If you pump it, where do you put it? As I said before, to go -$40 today it means people were calling everything they could think of (container ships, tanker trucks, strategic reserve, out of the way storage facilities, etc) before they absorb a $40K loss per contract (and they sell thousands).

What must happen next, which little demand is they must idle the pumps. They cant and wont pay oil workers $100K a year to sit around with an idle pump. We have about 10M oil workers in the US. We are potentially looking at 80% of those to be laid off… and this will take months to go through existing inventory if its completely full. This will extend for months, likely into Q4 2020, even Q1 2021. 

As a result of no travel and a slow opening all commerce will suffer. We are talking a stagnant society until at least June 30. More retail, consumer goods, automobile companies are going to go bankrupt. We have an annual GDP in excess of $20T. This is grinding to a halt. FED/Govt/Treasury has thrown ~$5T at it already, but they will need to throw $2T a month at it to keep it all afloat. Factor in treasuries, credit, bonds (corps), MBS, etc and we are looking at roughly $45T to service.  This is all becoming increasingly more difficult to service with a stalled economy. This is where we are now. 

This is why its likely unsustainable and we are about to really feel the pinch. The current market with S&P (/ES) trading at 2820 (was almost 2900 last week) is an artificial pump. How long will wall street look the other way while the government throws $1T here and there?",2020-04-20 23:33:39,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275135,1405 days 22:59:23.275135,630,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g53z9h/todays_negative_oil_is_economically_devastating/

xkcpwb,investing,Fed now forecasts hiking rates as high as 4.6%. That will hurt market alot harder.,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/the-fed-forecasts-hiking-rates-as-high-as-4point6percent-before-ending-inflation-fight.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/the-fed-forecasts-hiking-rates-as-high-as-4point6percent-before-ending-inflation-fight.html)

So the Fed now wants to hike to 4.6% and keep it there through 2023!

That's a lot higher than the 4% expected and will certainly affect the economy a lot harder not just in the short term but also next year and beyond.

Borrowing rates for consumers and companies will go up much higher and stay high which obviously will hurt spending therefore slowing down growth.

Higher rates means for most companies it becomes a lot more difficult to borrow money to finance further growth hence companies are preparing for the slowdown and scaling back.

Also the variable rate debt lots of companies have accumulated over the past years of easy money will really start to hurt now as this type of debt is linked to rates.

It's important to understand this is not just a short term effect. Rate hikes have impact on companies many quarters after they take affect. Most talking heads in the media but also permabulls here on reddit seem to ignore that and just keep talking up the markets so beware. A short term rebound does not mean it can't go lower afterwards!

Would not be surprised to see another short bear market pump before it goes much lower again once companies start revising their earnings forecast to the downside.

Powell trying to talk up the markets afterwards clearly doesn't help anymore. He should stick to what FOMC members have decided instead of trying to give it a ""rosy"" spin.

Final point, so we now have a problem in the housing market, credit market (too much borrowing going on) and in the equity markets (earnings compression coming). Not sure how that combo will end but don't have a good feeling about this. Hope this won't be 2008 all over again or worse.

That's in a nutshell what the Fed decided today and its future impact on the markets. Stay careful and don't be a mindless sheep.",2022-09-21 18:24:02,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275151,522 days 04:09:00.275152,674,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xkcpwb/fed_now_forecasts_hiking_rates_as_high_as_46_that/

6bddtd,investing,"A Month Ago, United Airlines Stock Dropped By 5% Following Negative Reports About A Passenger Being Dragged off One of Their Planes. Apparently, such events blow over in about 4 weeks; UAL is up 13% since","Following this discussion:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/64q201/united_airlines_stock_down_over_5_premarket/dg4e7cm/

The general consensus was: Always bet against the angry lynch mob. Their emotional rage dies out within a month, the fundamentals don't.

This was the highest rated comment by /u/rationalcomment

So I decided to look into it as this was not the first time I had heard about this phenomenon and it definitely goes against my natural instincts- apparently, companies with sound “fundamentals” always bounce back and often have incredible gains after about 4 weeks following an incident that sparks public outrage.

And this is how the UAL STOCK BEHAVED

On April 13/2017 UAL closed @ $69.07, with a farther dip to $67.75 after the CEO defended his employees with his “re-accommodating” comment  and everyone grabbed an extra pitch fork- this translated to a drop of about 5% from its April 10/2017 closing .

May 12 2017, or about 4 weeks after the incident, UAL closed at $76.41 which is almost a 13% gain since the dip.
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL

In summer 2009, UAL had an incident with a Canadian  musician and his guitar, and there was a dip and bounce in the following 4 weeks. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo) was released on July 6 2009. UAL opened at $3.31 on 6 July 2009, dipped to an intra-day low $3.07 (-7.25%) on 10 July 2009 but traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later

Interestingly, this phenomenon checks out on both occasions  given the PR disasters-but how and why is this possible?

 Lets compare it to a similarly sized company in the industry such as Southwest LUV. 

NB. I use fleet size when evaluating an airline's size. There are other metrics such as passengers carried, destinations, assets etc but for an airline business, to quite one of my profs, “it only makes you money when the plane is in the air; when it’s on the ground, it is costing you money”-this is a very simple way of looking at the big picture but I can qualify it in more detail. UAL has 738 to LUV’s 727

Since April 10/2017 to May 12 2017 LUV has had a 6% gain while UAL has had  11% gain in the last 4 weeks.However, looking back to the beginning of the year, UAL has had modest gains of about 5% ($72.71-$76.41 YTD) while LUV has had about a 14.5%($49.98-$57.22YTD) gain in the same time period. 
If you are just looking at the last 4 weeks, UAL performance is quite impressive and this what the proponents of the phenomenon are reporting. Remember, they reported an 81.27% upside in 2009 after 4 weeks of that video being released?

Lets look at some historical trends beginning with just before that video was released in 2009
4 weeks before the video was released, UAL opened at $4.99 i.e. Jun 8 2009 while LUV opened at $6.91. Both saw a slide in their share price UAL-33.6% & LUV -6.3% i.e. $3.31, $6.47 respectively.

It would be interesting to see how the two compare if LUV had suffered a 33.6% loss i.e $6.91+33%=$4.58

Had both these companies suffered a 33% slide, LUV would be starting its recovery at $4.58 while UAL starts at $3.31/  The quote on wikipedia says UAL traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later and presents this as evidence to this phenomenon. 

Now lets see what happens when we apply an 81.27% upside to LUV i,e, $4.58+81.27%=$8.30

On Aug 6 2009, LUV  actually had am intra day high of $9.19 and closed at $9.15 or 100.6% upside. This is how proponents of this phenomenon would have presented their material had this exact same incident had been with LUV. 

Without the fictitious event, LUV had a 42% upside in the period outlined

What proponents of this phenomenon conveniently fail to mention is that the stock had been trending downwards to this point for other unrelated reasons. But the video certainly didn’t help.  

Now, it is difficult to determine how much of 82% was part of a general recovery industry wide (AAL 19%, DEL 10%, LUV 42%), or a reaction to rumours of a merger? -United was in active negotiations with Continental at this point and a merger was signed in [May 2010.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/03merger.html)

On close Friday, UAL was up 12.78% from its low of $67.75 during the bad press in early April. The week before this incident, UAL, on average, traded at about $70.60. Given this as the starting point and adding 11%, UAL,  would be closing at about $79.62. This lag is compounded when you consider there was a 10% dip previously due to another unforced error in 2009. 

And there is no way of determining how much more United had to pay for Continental shares given that this initial scandal happened so close to coming to an agreement g-this was an all-stock-deal worth about $3bn.

In their latest scandal, UAL  has had to revise their overbooking policy, which made airlines a lot of money and made it very generous to try and kill the bad press. Delta is now offering up to $10k for an overbooking error which is way above industry standards and govts are looking to introduce legislation on this practise. I'm not convinced  the company has realized all its losses from a 13% gain in 4 weeks but I maybe wrong. However,a big part of the airline business fundamentals, is customer service, and while I'm not part of the lynch mob, I'm not willing to bet against them.

tl;dr- [This quote on wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breaks_Guitars#Stock_price_effect) on the stock price effect, is somewhat misleading as it suggests that losses following bad publicity are usually recovered within 4 weeks. The quote uses the UAL broken guitar incident in 2009 that purportedly had more than an 80% upside within 4 weeks. In fact, anyone who bought this stock a year prior, i.e mid August 2008,(UAL $10.22) to this event, was still down more than 40% in mid August 2009 (UAL $6.38) despite the surge. Bad press does affect the stock price negatively, and does remain depressed relatively beyond the purported 4 week threshold.

m33vsq,investing,Full Diligence Post on Nokia (NOK) Ahead of Capital Markets Day next Thursday (3/18)," I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several different subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and wanted to share my findings.

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.

We know GME absolutely ripped in Friday due to gamma hedging. Some old shorts covering could have been the main reason behind the ignition switch but I am not very confident about that.

GME is already ripping in pre-market and I don't know what's triggering that. Maybe it's retail euphoria.

Looks like we will continue to have gamma squeezes, tweets from Papa Cohen etc until shorts are forced to cover and close most of their shorts. I am changing my thesis. I thought we will see a slow TSLA-esque short-covering in GME. Looks like we are setting up for something much quicker.

> The Federal Reserve is preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation, a practice it has followed for more than three decades.
> 
> Instead, Fed officials would take a more relaxed view by allowing for periods in which inflation would run slightly above the central bank’s 2% target, to make up for past episodes in which inflation ran below the target.
> 
> “It would be a significant change in terms of how they are thinking about” the trade-off between employment and inflation, said Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs. “A lot of those things look very different now from the way they looked a few years ago,” he said.
> 
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the shift at a news conference last week when he said the central bank would soon conclude a comprehensive review of its policy-making strategy that began last year.
> 
> Mr. Powell initiated the review with an eye toward beefing up the Fed’s ability to counteract downturns in a world where interest rates are lower and more likely to remain pinned at zero.
> 
> Even before the severe shock from the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed had grown concerned about spells of low inflation that have bedeviled authorities in Japan over the past two decades and in Europe for the past decade.
> 
> The change being contemplated now is a way of essentially telling markets that rates will stay low for a very long time. Markets have likely already picked up on this change, given the continued declines in long-term interest rates.
> 
> The changes on their own will do little to provide more support to the economy right now because investors already understand that the Fed isn’t likely to raise interest rates for years, said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard. “It is a change at this point without meaning. It’s just words,” he said.
> 
> The Fed would formally adopt changes by altering a statement of long-run goals that it approves annually, something it last did in January 2019. “The changes we’ll make…are really codifying the way we’re already acting with our policies,” Mr. Powell said last week.
> 
> One way for the Fed to do that would be to amend that document to say inflation should average 2% “over time.”

82ja1e,investing,Gary Cohn to Resign as Trump’s Top Economic Adviser,"Gary D. Cohn, President Trump’s top economic adviser, plans to resign, becoming the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, White House officials said on Tuesday.

The officials insisted there was no single factor behind the departure of Mr. Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council. But his decision to leave came after he seemed poised to lose an internal struggle amid a Wild West-style process over Mr. Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

“Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,” Mr. Trump said in a statement to The New York Times. “He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”

Mr. Cohn is expected to leave in the coming weeks. He will join a string of recent departures by senior White House officials, including Mr. Trump’s communications director and a powerful staff secretary.

Yet the departure of Mr. Cohn, a free-trade oriented Democrat who fended off a number of nationalist-minded policies during his year in the Trump administration, could have a ripple effect on the president’s economic decisions and on the financial sector.

)

> Uber failed to overturn a tribunal ruling that **it should treat its drivers as “workers”**. If forced to treat its 40,000 UK drivers as “workers”, **it'll have guarantee minimum wage and holiday pay**. Uber says this would probably mean it scheduled shifts rather than allowing them to “log on” when they wanted to. Uber may then **have to pay employers’ national insurance contributions (UK Social Security) and VAT (sales tax)**

> Uber is **able to appeal again** to the Court of Appeal and possibly to the Supreme Court. 

> Tom Elvidge, Uber UK’s acting general manager, said: “**Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades**, long before our app existed. The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal.”

> Original tribunal found in October 2016 that the **company exerted too much control over their work to class them as truly independent.**

> James Farrar, **one of the two Uber drivers who brought the case**, said: “Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum wage rights.”

> Deliveroo, a food delivery gig platform, is also facing a legal challenge from a group of couriers who say they are not truly self-employed. Ditto for Pimlico Plumbers, taxi firm Addison Lee and courier company CitySprint


The implications are enormous here as it means:

- no more ability to charge a surge or at least high a multiple since shifts scheduling means they can control some basic level of service
- no more ability to incent people with 'unlimited earnings potential'
- that slavish customer service to maintain 4 stars goes out the window when you can't just fire people
- realistically, if it comes to pass I expect not many drivers to pass the 'probationary' period when many/most benefits can be held back

lxs4ue,investing,The Relationship between Stocks and Interest Rates,"I've seen a lot of misunderstanding across about the effect of rates on equities, so I figure I'd hop off of WSB to give an explainer about the relationship between stocks and interest rates, and show why the current sell off makes sense.

**Where do interest rates come from?**

Money has time value. Money today is usually worth more today than money tomorrow. How do we measure the time value of money? Interest! When we loan money out, we demand a return. What goes into an interest rate? There are 3 primary factors:

1. \*What do I think inflation is going to be?\*Say you estimate inflation to be 3% and rising, you'll demand a far higher interest rate to protect yourself.
2. \*How risky is this loan?\*Your lend to a group of risky businesses, you might jack up interest rates to make sure if one goes under, you'll make your money back from the rest
3. \*How much is everyone else willing to lend for?\*You'll need to compete with other lenders which helps determine the final interest rate.

**US Treasuries: King of Bonds**

So US government debt is considered primo with near 0 risk of default. The rates on US government debt determines whats known as the *risk free rate*.

The US issues debt at several different maturities from weeks, to months, to years. If we line up these interest rates, we get what is known as the [yield curve](https://www.gurufocus.com/yield_curve.php).

To reiterate, these rates are determined by the market and are manipulated by the Federal Reserve, which attempts to intervene in the market to get rates to its targets. When the Fed comes out and says it wants rates to stay near zero, this one of the ways they do it.

And this is exactly what happened during the corona crash, interest rates went to zero across the curve.

**How to Value a Company**

Let's say we have two companies. $BRR and $GRO. Let's say we're certain of their future cash flows.

* BRR is runs a money printer and makes $10M a year.
* GRO is a growth stock that's expected to make $100M a year in a decade.

How do we value these two companies based on cash flow alone? For simplicity, let's only look at the first 10 years. We need to determine the present value of the money the company makes in the future.

What is money from n years from now worth today?  money / (1 + risk\_free\_rate)\^n. So we can represent todays value for 10 years of cash flow like this:

Let $$$ Year X be the money we *know for sure* (i.e. the certainty equivalent) the company will make in year X. Let r be the risk free rate. Then we can model the value of the company roughly as follows:

Value = ($$$ Year 1) / (1 + r) + ... + ($$$ Year 10) / (1 + r)\^10

**How Rates Affect Value**

So which company do you think is worth more? BRR or GRO.

Well that depends on the interest rate! Let's say interest rates are at 0 or near zero. Their valuations taking no other factors into account are nearly the same: $100M.

Now let's start cranking up the interest rate slowly to see what the current valuation is.

&#x200B;

|r|BRR|GRO|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0.0%|100M|100M|
|0.5%|97M|95M|
|1.0%|94M|90M|
|2.0%|90M|82M|
|4.0%|81M|67M|

***As interest rates go up, the company that depends more on future earnings (GRO) is getting whacked. A move 0% to 2% knocks off almost 20% in one shot.***

**So why the fuss all of a sudden?**

Stocks went flying higher under the assumption that the fed would remain dovish, work to keep interest rates low, and would not be able to produce inflation over 2% if it wanted to. For a lot of reasons, people were betting that if that inflation would appear any were it would happen farther out in time near the 30Y. Given they figured the 5Y would stay low, and the 30Y would go high they shorted the 30Y bonds and went long 5Y. However, 5Y and 10Y treasury yields suddenly spiked making everyone ask whether inflation would come sooner and faster. People hoped the fed wold say something to alleviate this, but instead Powell had stated in September that he's fine [with inflation running hot over 2%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/02/what-do-changes-in-the-feds-longer-run-goals-and-monetary-strategy-statement-mean/)  (which no one seems to have believed) , and the fed today reiterated its not going to do anything about it in the short run. Hence, yields are still rising and equities are continuing to fall.  Add to this all the froth and speculation, a 20-30% correction makes a lot of sense in overheated names.

**Caveats about the analysis above**

1. The interest rates in this analysis are made up but the point still stands.
2. BRR is actually a better play since the risk free rate for earlier years will likely be lower than those farther out in time.
3. You shouldn't stop counting after year 10. You in theory can go out to infinity, and if rates are near zero, valuations for a growth company blow up too.
4. In most discount cashflow analysis, you don't use the risk free rate instead you use a discount rate specific to the company that takes risk into account for that company. In this case, it's fine to use the risk free rate since we assume we somehow know exactly how much the company will make (certainty equivalent). In the real world, we predict future cash flows by licking a finger sticking it in the air, and guessing which way the wind will blow.

**Inflation! Waddabout gold?**

If treasury yields stay above inflation, gold prices fall. That's because it's better to own a sheet of paper with a yield than a rock. Gold will only benefit if the Fed works to suppress rates farther out on the curve.  This is why [the price of gold is negatively correlated with real interest rates](https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-interest-rates/)*.*",2021-03-04 18:53:28,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275341,1088 days 03:39:34.275341,387,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lxs4ue/the_relationship_between_stocks_and_interest_rates/

fkr7b8,investing,Don't invest in companies that don't deserve it.,"If this drawdown shows us anything, it's that many companies are managed terribly and don't deserve your money. Airlines, hotels, cruise lines aren't able to survive the next 2 months without bailouts.

Now their headwinds are strong, but where's all their profits from the last 10 years? With most of them it was plowed into share buy backs. Some airlines spent 97%+ of their profits right back into share buybacks. 

So we have all these companies right now with their hands out. Unable to survive 2-3 really bad months. These are companies that've made sky high profits for years and years but have managed themselves in a paycheck to paycheck way regardless. 

We need to stop. We can't invest in companies that are completely fiscally irresponsible. Do not reward companies that can't stand 2-3 months of pressure without begging for a bailout. As far as I'm concerned they can go straight to hell for being so irresponsible.

Invest in strong, smart companies that have cash on hand, that can stand a few bad months, that haven't spent all their profits on share buybacks. Find companies that aren't running to Washington with their hands out. As soon as you see them begging for a bailout within weeks of a crisis, they should be persona non grata to us.

ryu2nb,investing,Number of Nasdaq Stocks Down 50% or More Is Almost at a Record,"A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.

Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values cut in half from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at Sundial Capital Research.

“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.

Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-com bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak.

“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”

Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting — released on Wednesday — pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.

All this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs.

Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.

Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:

EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected
Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected
Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.

Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.

Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.

However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.

Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.

Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.

*Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.

AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it’s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.",2023-05-25 02:13:21,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275373,276 days 20:19:41.275373,371,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13r52us/nvidia_shares_spike_26_on_huge_forecast_beat/

p5zu8c,investing,Michael Burry just unveiled a new short bet against Cathie's Wood's Arkk innovation ETF,"Michael Burry is the latest investor to reveal a bet against the ETF, according to Scion Asset Management's second-quarter 13F filing. Burry initiated the new position by buying $31 million worth of puts in the ARKK ETF.

Burry's not the only one, as the Disruptive Innovation ETF has a 30-day put-to-call ratio of 1.8, meaning more people are buying bearish put options on the fund than bullish call options.

Other investors are outright shorting shares of the ETF, with short interest currently sitting at a record high 11.63%, according to data from Koyfin. With 21.58 million shares sold short as of Friday, the bet against ARK Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF now totals $2.6 billion. 		

Burry's bet against ARK is likely tied to his conviction that Tesla is a short, given that Scion Asset Management's largest position is a $731 million put position in the electric vehicle manufacturer, representing a whopping 35% of his fund's more than $2 billion in assets under management. Burry increased his bet against Tesla by 34% in the second-quarter. 

Tesla remains Ark Invests largest position by a significant margin, with it making up nearly 11% of the ARKK ETF as of Friday.

hwzv4a,investing,Maybe I'm crazy but 2008 felt worse.,"Am I the only one who feels that way? I remember 2008 being a time of real panic. The news and media was very gloomy, and uncertainty was driving real fear and terror. Bank runs were a real possibility and the dithering in Congress seemed like it might bring everything crashing down. The people in my life (family, friends, and acquaintances) seemed anxious and fearful about the future. I knew more than a few people who lost their asses in 2008. Many of them only partially recovered, and some never did. 

The covid crises is supposedly worse. All of the metrics we have so far seem to indicate that this is worse than 2008 by a longshot. But it just doesn't feel like it. The people in my life seem to be doing well. I don't sense the same fear and anxiety in news and media that I did in 2008. I don't feel overly worried about my long term financial situation. And I don't fear the economic future of the country.

p2dvuk,investing,Investing advice from the book 'The Intelligent Investor is useless. Graham agreed before he died.,"Benjamin Graham, author of the investing tome *The Intelligent Investor* advocated buying stocks trading at less than their net working assets (cash in the bank minus any debts). In theory, this sounds great but very few stocks trade that cheaply anymore, apart from scandalous small caps alledgedly with accounting frauds.

One of Benjamin Graham’s investment criteria instructs conservative investors to avoid trading stocks trading above 1.5x their book value. If one would have followed this advice, in the last decade they would hold nothing but a few insurance and bank stocks.

Just before Graham died in 1976 he was asked if detailed fundamental analysis of stocks (a technique he became famous for) was still a favorable investment strategy, his exact words were -

&#x200B;

>“In general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities.

But many strategists warn that while central banks and governments have taken the sting out of market disruption with their interventions, more disruption may lie ahead.*

>*“My concern is this relief rally might not be sustainable,” said Mislav Matejka, global equity strategist at JPMorgan.*  
>  
>*Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have also urged caution, particularly as companies absorb the scale of the shock from the pandemic. “Equity markets may need to fall 50 per cent before they have priced in this year’s likely earnings drop,” Robert Buckland, head of equity strategy at Citi, said.*  
>  
>*Goldman Sachs’ strategists said this week that equities were already pricing in a recovery in economic growth, even as the extent of the corporate shock remains unclear. “This increases the risk of disappointment near-term,” the bank added.*  
>  
>*The rebound since late March has coincided with signs that the virus might have peaked in some of the worst-hit countries, raising hopes that lock-downs that have hit economies from the US to India could soon be lifted.*

mw4jei,investing,PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendations,"For those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

NEW YORK (AP) — Craig Wright, a computer scientist who claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin, prevailed in a civil trial verdict Monday against the family of a deceased business partner that claimed it was owed half of a cryptocurrency fortune worth tens of billions.

A Florida jury found that Wright did not owe half of 1.1 million Bitcoin to the family of David Kleiman. The jury did award $100 million in intellectual property rights to a joint venture between the two men, a fraction of what Kleiman’s lawyers were asking for at trial.

“This was a tremendous victory for our side,” said Andres Rivero of Rivero Mestre LLP, the lead lawyer representing Wright.

David Kleiman died in April 2013 at the age of 46. Led by his brother Ira Kleiman, his family has claimed David Kleiman and Wright were close friends and co-created Bitcoin through a partnership.

irhabh,investing,Bloomberg: Nikola’s History of Discrepancies Has Been Hiding in Plain Sight,"(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. has left a trail of inconsistent statements and contradictory announcements that are now coming under scrutiny from short-sellers eager to poke holes in the electric-vehicle company’s success story.

Hindenburg Research, which holds a short position in Nikola stock and stands to gain if the shares fall, released a report Thursday detailing what it called “dozens of lies” about the company’s capabilities, partnerships or products. The firm used internal emails, analyzed photos and even cited an investigator dispatched to rural Utah to test how far a car would roll down a hill. Nikola said Hindenburg’s report was full of falsehoods but hasn’t offered anything specific to rebut the allegations.

It doesn’t take a hedge fund or a private eye to determine that Nikola, which struck a partnership this week with General Motors Co., has a pattern of discrepancies. A look at some of its announcements and filings, along with statements and tweets by Chairman Trevor Milton and other executives over the past few years, yields other examples that weren’t part of Hindenburg’s report. “It’s a bit confusing trying to follow Trevor on his various social media outlets about the timing and cadence of communication of the different variables that you’re talking about,” Jeff Osborne, a Cowen & Co. analyst, told executives on an Aug. 4 conference call.

Nikola’s shares have tumbled 24% since the Hindenburg report, which, among other sources, cited a Bloomberg story from June about the company exaggerating the capabilities of a truck.

“We are committed to doing our best to keep the investing public and all of our stakeholders informed and up to date at all times,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell said Friday in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg about the following items.

Under Construction

At a press event on July 22, ahead of the groundbreaking of Nikola’s Coolidge, Arizona, factory, Head of Global Manufacturing Mark Duchesne fielded a question on when construction would get underway. “That one is an easy answer,” he said. “Start of construction is tomorrow.”

The timeline was repeated by Milton the following day in a tweet. But “construction” turns out to be a broad term.

To facilitate the groundbreaking ceremony, the city of Coolidge issued Nikola a temporary use permit on July 13. The document, obtained by Bloomberg, allowed the company to do some limited ground clearing and preparation for holding the event, along with listing a plan for coronavirus safeguards. It didn’t allow further construction to start beyond that. The company also obtained a Pinal County dust permit around the same time, a legal requirement in Arizona.

On Aug. 7, the company received its at-risk grading and drainage permit, City Manager Rick Miller said by phone. The permit allows Nikola to clear dirt and do drainage work on the site, but as yet the company doesn’t have the permits required for foundation work, plumbing, electrical or vertical construction, Miller said. The permits are available through public-records requests.

On Wednesday, Nikola said in a tweet that Coolidge’s city council had approved the company’s “factory masterplan” and that “construction can now go forward.” This is only partly true, Miller said. It was the planning and zoning commission that approved a “major site plan.” The approval will allow Nikola and its architects and engineers to apply for the next batch of permits.

In a statement, Nikola said that by “construction” it meant everything from groundbreaking to seeking permits. Now that its building plan is approved, “the various permits will be obtained in cadence with the steps of the construction. We remain on schedule for Phase 1,” the company said in an email.

”The factory will be up in 12 months,” Milton said in a live broadcast on Instagram on Friday night. “The permit was just issued by the city. We are all good to go.”

Puzzling Partnership

Nikola has a stated ambition of manufacturing hydrogen-powered fuel cell semi trucks by 2023. Since 2017, it has had an agreement for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh to “develop, build, test and support” various components for Nikola’s prototypes including a fuel-cell system, battery packs, steering pumps and motors, according to a regulatory filing in March.

The details of which partner is contributing what to the project has shifted over time, and the future of the deal has gotten hazier.

Nikola agreed to pay Bosch around $40 million for the development, according to the filing. In a presentation to investors in April, Nikola described the agreement with Bosch as a “co-development” and strategic supply chain partnership and said the company would jointly own any intellectual property developed with Bosch.

However, Nikola executives have regularly stated that Nikola designed, developed and will provide much of the technology for its vehicles -- not Bosch. On Friday, Chief Financial Officer Kim Brady said that Nikola will provide only 15% of the parts in battery electric pickups due to be built in Ulm, Germany, while partner Iveco provides the rest. However, he added that Nikola’s input represents 90% of the truck’s value.

“We are responsible for Nikola Tre -- the batteries, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system,” Brady said. “All the key electric propulsion systems come from Nikola.”

As recently as Aug. 25, Bosch has said that it’s “working with the company to make the fuel-cell drive for trucks suitable for mass production.”

On Monday, Nikola announced that GM -- not Bosch -- will mass-supply a fuel cell system for Nikola’s Class 7 and 8 semi trucks, as well as the battery packs for its debut electric pickup, the Badger. On Friday, Nikola clarified that Bosch will supply semi truck fuel cells in Europe, while GM will have exclusivity everywhere else.

“Bosch is an investor, board member and supplier to Nikola. They help us in many facets of our business as our partner,” Nikola said.

Milton bristled at a claim by a Twitter user that Nikola was jilting Bosch in favor of GM.

“Bosch as a company with a dedicated hydrogen strategy welcomes the decision of GM to enter this market as an important player,” Bosch spokesman Tim Wieland said in an email. “Beyond that, Nikola and Bosch have been working together for several years, not only on the fuel cell power train but also on other innovations like the steering system and the Mirror Cam System for the first prototypes of the Nikola trucks. The two companies will continue to cooperate in the future, also on fuel cells.”

Game Changer

Nikola’s narrative about its battery strategy has also shifted over time.

In November 2019, Nikola issued a press release claiming to have “game-changing” battery cell technology that it would unveil at an event in 2020. Nikola also said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire a “world-class battery engineering team” to help bring the new battery to pre-production.

“We are talking about doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world,” Milton said in the statement.

In July, Milton tweeted that Nikola would “make the entire pack like the top guys do” for its upcoming pickup truck, called the Badger. He said that all internal components, such as batteries, inverters, software and controls, are Nikola’s own intellectual property. “We own it all in house,” he said.

Milton clarified in a tweet on Thursday that Nikola’s change of direction -- to use GM’s Ultium battery technology for the Badger -- was a result of cost analysis and cost savings.

Beer Trucks

Back in March, Nikola said in a presentation to investors that it has a “signed binding agreement” to provide Anheuser-Busch with as many as 800 hydrogen fuel cell electric semi trucks. What the presentation didn’t say was that Anheuser-Busch committed to buy fewer trucks than that, and doesn’t have to buy any at all.

The deal was first announced in May 2018 and stated the trucks were originally expected to be integrated into Anheuser-Busch’s dedicated fleet by the end of 2020, according to a press release.

That timeline isn’t going to be met. During the Aug. 4 earnings call, Russell, the CEO, updated investors on the deal, saying, “We do believe that we’ll be able to give them test prototypes before the end of 2021; serial production or mass production of the fuel cell truck will not begin until 2023.”

That does corroborate with the timeline for production set out in a July filing -- and to be fair, lots of people’s plans have changed this year. But in the same filing, Nikola revealed that Anheuser-Busch retains the right to cancel the truck order, though there’s no indication that will happen. The contract also has lease terms and rental rates that may be hard for Nikola to meet, according to the filing, “depending on our ability to develop our trucks and hydrogen network according to current design parameters and cost estimates.”

The agreement between the two companies states that Anheuser-Busch gets priority of delivery for as much as 20% of Nikola’s initial “production line of Class 8 vehicles.” To get production going by 2023, Nikola must work to have dedicated equipment in Anheuser Busch’s breweries and distribution centers by the end of 2021, according to the deal terms. Anheuser-Busch only agreed to use at least 600 trucks -- the 800 figure, according to the document, is an estimate of what the brewer will need.

“They have been, and continue to be, a great long-term partner in our shared vision of a zero-emission future (a Nikola Two prototype hauled our first load over public roads for them in St. Louis not too long ago),” Russell said in the statement Friday, referring to Anheuser-Busch. “Our original agreement with them has been modified over time. The current agreement terms are as we set forth in our earnings call.”

Anheuser-Busch didn’t respond to a request for comment. The partnership with Nikola will help the brewer transition its entire long-haul fleet to zero-emission vehicles, Anheuser-Busch said last November.

Prototype Production

On July 13, Milton said European partner Iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes.

“We have a truck coming in to production right now with 720KwH, the largest battery we know of anywhere in the world coming in to production,” Milton said on the TC’s Charcast Podcast. “We have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm, Germany.”

On Aug. 4, during the company’s debut earnings call, Russell echoed the sentiment, saying that the first five prototypes were “coming off the end of the facility at this point.”

Those statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco’s progress in Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.

“As stated previously, the first five production prototypes of the Nikola Tre are being completed, by an assembly team at the Ulm facility. Also as stated previously, the Nikola/IVECO JV mass production line facility in Ulm is still under construction, and is on track for the start of regular serial production in 2021,” Russell said Friday. “We anticipate that a number of current IVECO personnel will join the Nikola/IVECO JV production team in Ulm.”

t0da9y,investing,Bitcoin is not the new gold,"While today is only one day, I think that it pretty dramatically shows that bitcoin is not the new gold, as a lot of its proponents claim. As of 10am EST this morning, bitcoin is down about 7% while gold is up about 2%. Something like a Russian attack on Ukraine is what people have in mind when thinking about a black swan-type event, but bitcoin has only magnified losses. 

Instead of acting like an uncorrelated asset, bitcoin basically just acts like a super high-beta tech stock. Not saying anything about what will make anyone more money going forward, but I think any rationale to have bitcoin to improve portfolio diversification is mostly a fiction.


Edit: the time is now 355pm EST, and stock markets, bitcoin, and gold have dramatically reversed this afternoon (SPY +1.5%, QQQ +%3, BTC +%2%, gold -0.5%). This basically just proves my point. The point isn't that bitcoin will not make money in the future (it might, I have no idea), the point is that bitcoin is very correlated with tech stocks instead of being an uncorrelated asset like gold. The action today reinforces that idea.",2022-02-24 15:10:17,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275552,731 days 07:22:45.275552,890,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/t0da9y/bitcoin_is_not_the_new_gold/

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, which could heighten fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct 10, compared to 845,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week.

The weak labor market and resulting economic hardship are major hurdles to President Donald Trump’s chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s candidate, has blamed the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis for the worst economy in at least 73 years.

Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months.

With the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated. Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crashed by the pandemic leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government.

High unemployment and a resurgence in new coronavirus cases across the United States threaten the economy’s recovery from a recession, which started in February.

Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to as low as a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.",2020-10-15 13:12:00,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275559,1228 days 09:21:02.275559,346,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jbn9hs/us_weekly_jobless_claims_unexpectedly_increase/
njy53z,investing,CNBC Pro Goldman starts Coinbase with a buy rating and says the stock can jump more than 30%,"Investors should ride through volatility in the crypto space by buying shares of Coinbase, according to Goldman Sachs.

Analyst Will Nance initiated coverage of the cryptocurrency exchange on Monday with a buy rating, saying in a note to clients that Coinbase is the best way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency ecosystems.

Coinbase went public through a direct listing on April 14 and, after an initial pop, its shares have struggled. The stock rose above $400 during that first day of trading, but on Friday closed near $224.

* That volatility has been on display in recent weeks as seen in crypto swings as evidenced in bitcoin's wild ride. This morning bitcoin rises to $37.6K but had dropped as low as $31.1K on Sunday.
* COIN stock rises 3.0% in premarket trading.
* Sets price target at $306; implies a 36% upside potential for stock based on Friday's closing price of $224.35.
* Nance also likes COIN's leverage to an ecosystem with strong growth driven by increasing adoption of digital currencies, its consumer platform with strong customer acquisition trends and rapidly growing institutional business, and its opportunities to add additional features and capabilities.
* Though the continued success or failure of crypto as an asset class will ultimately determine COIN's future, ""we believe COIN represents a blue-chip way through with to invest in the development of the ecosystem,"" the analyst writes.
* Points to COIN's careful approach to regulatory compliance, crypto-native technology stack, and role as an innovation hub for new crypto endeavors.
* Nance's Buy rating is more optimistic than the average SA Author's rating of Neutral (6 Bullish, 5 Neutral, 2 Bearish) and aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 1 Bullish, 4 Neutral).
* Last week, Coinbase snagged an Outperform rating at Wedbush helped by its ""first mover"" advantage.

* SPAC merger OPEN crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.
* ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled.
* AFRM is down from ATH of $147 in Feb to 47 today.
* Deliveroo (LON: ROO) crashed from ATH of £3.9 on IPO day to £2.3 on Apr 26 and trades at £2.4 today.

The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which reported great earnings on Monday.

But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. Hot 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which - except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.

* LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.
* In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.
* PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.
* SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.

>“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” he said. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

...

>As he has before, Powell ascribed much of the pressures coming from pandemic-specific factors, in particular escalated demand for goods over services that supply could not meet. He conceded that Fed officials and many economists “widely underestimated” how long those pressured would last.

>While those aggravating factors have persisted, the Fed and Congress provided more than $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus. Powell said he continues to believe that inflation will drift back to the Fed’s target, but it’s time for the historically easy policies to end.

>“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” said Powell, whose official title now is chairman pro tempore as he waits Senate confirmation to a second term. “In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

>Powell also addressed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying it is adding to supply chain and inflation pressures. Under normal circumstances, the Fed generally would look through those types of events and not alter policy. However, with the outcome unclear, he said policymakers have to be wary of the situation.

>“In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks,” he said. “However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.”

>Powell had indicated last week that the FOMC also is prepared to begin running off some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. He noted that the process cold begin as soon as May, but no firm decision has been made.",2022-03-21 16:40:43,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275580,706 days 05:52:19.275580,265,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tjg116/powell_if_we_conclude_that_it_is_appropriate_to/

# Overview

""Proterra is a high-growth commercial electric vehicle technology leader with over a decade of production experience. The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:

* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;
* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market’s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and
* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.

The Company’s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.

Proterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra’s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.""

Proterra is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **ACTC.** A [press statement](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Proterra-Release.pdf) released on January 12th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the first half of 2021"". There is some speculation regarding the date; they’ve already filed the S-4, so the timeline for merger vote looks to be around end of March to April first week according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/le6yur/proterra_actc_merger/) and [the SEC website.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1820630&owner=exclude)

* [Form 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-006284/)

# Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility SPAC Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January ACTC prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the SPAC shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without SPAC cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

[Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/actc-stock-arclight-spac-merger-proterra-undervalued/)

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing ACTC is trading at $15.65, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **116.42% below it's actual value.**

# Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is ""the first half of this year""). 

The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**Bear Case:** I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.

**How to Play?**

I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.

1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)
4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.

**Positions:**

3,865 shares @ 22.37

10C 04/16 $20.00

12C 05/21 $22.50

17C 05/21 $25.00

6C 08/20 $35

**TL;DR:** Fundamental's alone show this company is already **116.42% undervalued**, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can't even come up with a PT. I would *expect* a PT post-merger to travel upwards to \~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is \~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is \~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn't want to gloss this one over if I were you. If you prefer you could simply check out [their investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf) 

**EDIT:** The 10.3 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors. The list is in the presentation. 

**EDIT 2:** This is a fundamental DD. There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned. Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 10.3 factor for diversity. A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers, Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider. They don’t just make buses. 

**EDIT 3:** Fair warning, even though Proterra is significantly undervalued, there are other market mechanics at play. With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all. I think this is an excellent play, now you just need excellent timing.

**EDIT4:** Added “2025E” to EDIBTA

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation. Any words urging someone to do something is only going as far as suggesting they do their own DD, it is in no way an attempt to convince anyone to make any financial decisions. Plus...this thing doesn't need to get pumped. I'm just trying to share the find.*",2021-03-09 02:13:21,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275595,1083 days 20:19:41.275595,580,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m0wbra/actc_proterra_dd_the_most_undervalued_stock_on/

prw7it,investing,China’s growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios,"**Further conclusions (ADDED sep 22)..**

* Chinese indexes opened on Wednesday and didn't show panic. Media coverage in China shows that Evergrande news are secondary or even tertiary (possibly sidelined) to avoid stark main streets reactions 

* Onshore (local) bond payments of Evergrande have been resolved through negotiations off the clearing house, which a implies delayed payment schedule. (this is saying bond is paid on Sep 23, without payment actually happening on Sep 23)
 
* According to bond covenants (bond agreement terms) Evergrande may have 30 days to pay its unpaid or partially paid bond interests/coupons if not completely paid on the agreed date without facing penalties ... hence the unfolding of the crisis due to unpaid onshore and offshore bond obligations may take months, which provides the Chinese gov with ample time to inject liquidity, trim & restructure the Evergrande empire as well as externalise toxic assets. Thus containment is likely, bits and pieces may resurface in 202 when more data about China based land and property sales is available, steering further market sentiment in positive or negative direction.

* Possibly most of the upcoming gov & authorities' involvement will happen behind curtains, so we won't learn much about the evolution of this drama in the news.

* markets in US, EU and Asia will likely calm down short-term until big quarterly data dumps show the impact on China market sentiment, incl. Caixin Manuf. PMI, Services PMI and Commodity Index


Assumptions…

* 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)

* Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday

* 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 

* China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already

* a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the gov's regulatory actions in respect to Chinese tech companies (declining tech stocks), hence sentiment sensibility is heightened

* holidays in China until wednesday .. markets are closed... thus delayed reaction of Chinese main street

* Evergrande's total assets approx. 2trillion RMB (2% of China’s GDP) and complex structure (+200 offshore & almost 2000 onshore wholly and non-wholly owned subsidiaries). Accounts for roughly 4% of China’s total property sales. Its over 123,000 employees and 3.8 million contractors make up a fraction of China’s over 400 million urban labor force.

* 40% of mainland China based bank loans are backed by properties


Further Information

* Insightful article (English) from China's leading business magazine Caixin (China's version of WSJ/FT) about the internal dealings (various schemes & crowdsourcing debts)  of Evergrande    https://archive.is/8QjU6  
* based on the article there could be a large volume of hidden debts and other obligations off their balance sheet
* it will likely take years longer to complete the portfolio of 800 building projects under construction, because of unpaid contractors and due to Evergrande having to pay other obligations first
* in respect to the complexity of Evergrande's assets, holdings, financial products and corporate constructs, it may take the Chinese gov months to accomplish at least the minimum of insight into the breadth of the longterm financial obligations
* UBS estimates that $19 billion of Evergrande’s liabilities are made up of outstanding offshore bonds.
* in the case of bankrupt developer Yinyi Group (approx. July 2019) the process from application to restructuring kickoff took 2 years (Dec 11, 2020 signed reorganization Investment Agreement), yet it seems to have partially failed because investors didn't come up with the required funds (Link Bloomberg Law: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/yinyis-investor-fails-to-wire-required-funds-for-restructuring) (2nd payment up until July apparently was also much lower than agreed by courts).... these things take long in China and are very intransparent, yet they may suffice as means of containment



Market impact

* after digging into surrounding circumstances many analysts (jeffries, JPM, MS, citi, UBS, Barclay, Fidelity) believe that systemic distress is not evident, risks are priced in and that contagion can be avoided  ([Bloomberg!] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/wall-street-s-message-on-evergrande-china-has-it-under-control)

* we may see more market tremors once Chinese markets are open (wednesday), so Tuesday may be green in US and Europe in the verge of slight rebounds

* a large net injection may signal Beijing’s intent to reduce systemic stress. If the Peoples Bank of China withdraws funds, that could mean it’s prepared to tolerate higher market volatility as the developer moves closer to a default.



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
**1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China.. with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services) due to panic and liquidity-squeeze-related market actions. Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderately sized property sell-off -> the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-> large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


**2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China.. with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -> the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power moderately and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market with rather big slow down of international commodity markets (spec. looking at Australia, New Zealand, South Africa)

-> moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


**3.) Orderly containment - small spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with extra large debts). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -> the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep China's property prices stable thus not affecting savings/wealth of the main street too significantly; the spill over effects would be barely visible.

-> only short-term / slight impact on international markets (selected sectors only)

I never understood why young people would ever choose this. You shouldn’t worry about short term volatility. Invest in the highest expected return instruments. 

Reducing short term volatility also kills expected returns in the long run.

Short term volatility is a result of emotions.

Shares of [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) halted trading Wednesday pending news amid the bankrupt company’s controversial stock sale.

The stoppage follows the Securities and Exchange Commission telling [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) that the regulator [has issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/the-sec-told-bankrupt-hertz-it-has-issues-with-its-plan-to-sell-stock-chairman-jay-clayton-says.html) with the rental car company’s plan to sell stock.

“In this particular situation, we have let the company know that we have comments on their disclosure,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on CNBC’s [“Squawk on the Street”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/) on Wednesday. “In most cases when you let a company know that the SEC has comments on their disclosure they do not go forward until those comments are resolved.”

Shares were trading down about half a percent to $1.94.

Hertz filed for bankruptcy May 22, hurt as demand for car rentals dried up as travelers have stayed home during the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). The stock hit a low of 40 cents intraday on May 26. But in the days ahead, shares began to recover and eventually surged to more than $6 per share last Monday.

Following the increase, Hertz asked the bankruptcy court Thursday to allow it to sell up to $1 billion in shares, a last ditch effort for it to raise capital even though the value of the stock could get wiped out. The request [was approved by the court Friday.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/hertz-granted-approval-to-sell-up-to-1-billion-in-shares.html)

Hertz said in a government filing Monday that it would sell up to $500 million in common stock. It warned potential investors that it’s [almost certain that the equity will become worthless.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/15/hertz-says-it-expects-stockholders-to-lose-all-their-money-in-filing-for-selling-more-stock.html)

Such a sale is highly unusual for a company going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since common shareholders, who are last in line when assets are allocated during court proceedings, may be left with worthless stock.

The court, in its ruling, said the approval “in no event will result in the issuance” of the shares. The debtors are authorized, but not required, to sell shares of the common stock.

The stock also could be delisted. Hertz in a public filing with the [SEC last week said](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3581821-hertz-to-challenge-nyse-delisting) that it has appealed a delisting request by the NYSE.

Trading activity in names like Hertz has spiked on millennial-favored stock trading app Robinhood in the days following the bankruptcy filings, according to Robintrack, which tracks Robinhood account activity but is not affiliated with the company.",2020-06-17 17:12:46,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275608,1348 days 05:20:16.275608,336,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/havi51/hertz_stock_halted_pending_news_amid_controversy/

nprdln,investing,10 more interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"As a sequel to ""10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM"", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.

Starting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),

1. SPGP: Invesco S&P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPGP) . ""Growth at a Reasonable Price"" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or ""TTM"" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  SPGP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!

Moving on to Factor ETFs,

2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.

3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.

4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.

5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.

6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles ""quality"" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for ""profitability"", ""solvency and financial risk"", and ""earnings quality"".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.

Let us not forget commodities,

7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and ""flat"" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.

8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.

Seeking dividends?

9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.

Finally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,

10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.

Disclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).

What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in?

mnvx7u,investing,China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust Case,"The penalty is Beijing’s toughest action to date in its campaign to tighten supervision of the country’s internet Goliaths.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

hyib83,investing,Company Debt Analysis - I created a checklist to help investors understand things to look for when analyzing a company's financial health - particularly in regards to the amount of debt they have and if they can afford to pay it.,"If companies cannot afford to pay their debt then eventually they will go bankrupt and you, the shareholder, will be left with NOTHING! How much debt a company has and more importantly if they are able to pay back their debt is essential to know before investing in the company. Ultimately companies who become too over-leveraged with debt may face trouble repaying it if their revenue declines, their earnings drop, if interest rates rise or in the case of COVID-19, an unexpected black swan event comes out of nowhere. Below is the checklist I use when analyzing the debt of a company.

Debt Analysis Checklist:

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt   
\- Remember use only ""Term Debt"" both short term and long term   
\- Liabilities are NOT Debt  
\- Ideally total debt would be decreasing over time, however, more important than the total dollar amount is whether or not the company can pay it

Step 2: Calculate Debt to Equity  
\- Debt / Equity = Long Term debt / Shareholder equity   
\- I do not include Short Term debt in the above equation unless the company does not have enough cash/cash equivalents and short term investments to cover it  
\- Ideally companies would have 25% or less debt

Step 3: Does the company have positive free cash-flow?   
\- We want to see positive free cash flow. This means the company is actually bringing in ""cash"" which it could use to pay back debt  
\- If a company has negative free cash flow then it's not bringing in any money!!! How can they pay their debt obligations with no money?

Step 4: Does the company have enough cash/cash equivalents/short term investments to cover short term debt?  
\- We want to see companies have enough cash/equivalents and short-term investments on their balance sheet to cover short term debt

Step 4: Does the company have enough free cash flow to cover short term debt?  
\- If the company is free cash flow positive, does that amount meet or exceed its short term debt obligations. Ideally it would.

Step 5: Check the income statement to see how much the company's interest expense is.  
\- Does interest / dividend income cover interest expense? This would be ideal!  
\- Does operating income / EBIT cover interest expense? If so what is the TIE ratio (times-interest-earned ratio: EBIT / Interest Expense). The higher the number the better!

Step 6: Look for trends in net income and free cash flow  
\- We want to invest in companies that make money and have positive free cash flow. If these numbers begin to go negative then investigate and determine if the company can turn things around.

Step 7: Calculate the company's overall cash position  
\- Overall cash position = cash + equivalents + short term investments / Long-Term Debt  
\- Higher the number the better.

Step 8: Remember not all debt is bad. What is more important that the total amount of debt is whether the company has the operating income, interest/dividend income, or free cash flow to cover it. Even if they took a significant hit to revenue - would the company still be able to pay its debt obligations - those are the types of companies we want to invest in!",2020-07-27 00:41:48,2024-02-25 22:33:02.275636,1308 days 21:51:14.275637,103,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hyib83/company_debt_analysis_i_created_a_checklist_to/

j1biar,investing,Bloomberg: Nikola founder Milton's fall reveals what his backers feared,"Back in March, long before a short seller would raise questions about electric-truck company Nikola Corp. and hasten its founder’s exit, **early investors in the company were expressing concerns of their own. Those investors, led by mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, were worried that Trevor Milton, for all his brash visionary talk and Twitter braggadocio, lacked the ability that Elon Musk possesses to deliver these sorts of newfangled products to market. They lobbied successfully to remove him as CEO before the company’s June IPO and for Milton’s father to leave the board, according to people familiar with the matter. When the deal was done, Milton only held the title of chairman, the post he resigned this month.**

The back-room negotiations show that Milton’s past was a concern to investors months before General Motors Co. executives placed a bet on the company in a US$2 billion deal carved out after the IPO. They liked Milton’s vision and his ability to raise cash and felt the venture was safeguarded from his shortcomings in operations by his push upstairs, say people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the events that have unfolded since the short-seller report, with Nikola’s stock plunging amid a steady stream of negative headlines, have exposed just how high the risks still were.

Now, it’s up to former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose blank-check company VectoIQ took Nikola public via reverse merger in June, and Nikola CEO Mark Russell to stabilize the business and regain investor confidence. The plan with GM was to use Nikola’s hot stock and Milton’s ability to raise money to build a hydrogen-fueled trucking business with GM’s technology.

“There is obviously someone on the diligence side who isn’t going to get a nice bonus this year,” said Reilly Brennan, founder of the venture capital fund Trucks Inc. “The best possible thing if you’re a shareholder is that Milton is no longer running the company and you have Girsky as chairman and GM providing technology.”

The GM deal was originally scheduled to close Sept. 30, and the automaker has said it plans to carry through, but that timing may slip, say people familiar with the matter. BP Plc is still engaged with Nikola in talks to partner on a network of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel-cell trucks the company hopes to sell, but also is slowing the pace for a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BP and GM declined to comment.

Milton’s tale reads like a Greek tragedy. The report by short seller Hindenburg Research accused Milton of overhyping Nikola’s technology and has prompted investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cousin has accused him of a decades-ago sexual assault, which he denies. The company’s value peaked at US$30 billion and is now worth about US$7 billion.

Girsky and GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra have both said publicly that they did plenty of due diligence. People familiar with the matter say that GM found out when scouting the deal that it had better batteries and fuel-cell technology but joined forces because Nikola had a working semi truck and access to capital markets. In addition, GM will get paid to build Nikola’s Badger pickup on existing assembly lines. Milton was so excited to get the Badger pickup program moving that he signed a deal that heavily favored GM, one of the people said.

Nikola’s stock and GM’s US$2 billion stake are worth less than half what they were on Sept. 8, when the deal was announced. Milton’s own stake is worth US$1.7 billion, down from almost US$5 billion at one point.

Milton said in a June interview with Bloomberg News that he grew up in modest surroundings in Layton, Utah. His family moved to Las Vegas when he was very young and he lost his mother to cancer shortly after moving back to Utah in the sixth grade. He wrote on Twitter he didn’t finish high school, earning an equivalency certification instead, and later dropped out of college. His Twitter account has since been deleted.

He grew up in a tight-knit Mormon family, according to Aubrey Smith, his first cousin. She went on social media recently and accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1999 when she was 15 and he was 17.

In a public account on Facebook and Twitter, and repeated in a phone interview, Smith said that Milton came onto her at the funeral of their grandfather. He took her shirt off without permission, Smith wrote, and then he touched her inappropriately before someone knocked at the door and she ran out.

Milton denied the allegations through a spokesman.

Smith said Milton raised money from family members to get his start. He founded and ran several businesses, including a home-security company that Milton claims he sold for US$1.5 million. Next, in 2009, he founded an e-commerce platform called Upillar.com, which Milton claims “pioneered the shopping cart online.”

Then he got into clean propulsion but ended up embroiled in litigation with dHybrid Inc., which he founded in 2009. The company retrofitted diesel vehicles with natural-gas-burning turbines, claiming the dual system had greater efficiency.

But a deal with Swift Transportation Co. in 2010 ended in court when Swift alleged dHybrid defaulted on a US$322,000 loan and that it retrofitted only half of the agreed vehicles. The case was dismissed in 2015.

Milton later tried to sell dHybrid to a company called sPower in May 2012 but that, too, got mired in lawsuits after sPower backed out and accused Milton of exaggerating its technological capabilities.

Amid the litigation, Milton started another company with a very similar name, dHybrid Systems, selling it in 2014 to Worthington Industries.

During an interview with Bloomberg in June, Milton said that dHybrid Inc. was a success but conceded that, “we ended up closing that one down because of some litigation.”

His next startup was Nikola, founding it in 2014 in Salt Lake City before moving to Phoenix. Emulating Musk, he took the name from the electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, and the company was soon billed as the Tesla of Trucks. His plan was seen as potentially disrupting the entire transportation industry by making trucks that ran on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells. He also planned to build a network of hydrogen filling stations.

Friends and Family

Milton had friends and family members working for Nikola despite resumes that didn’t match the job. His brother, Travis Milton, is director of hydrogen and infrastructure. His LinkedIn profile shows that most of his experience was being “self-employed” in Maui. The short seller, Hindenburg Research, said that Travis Milton poured concrete as a contractor. Milton’s father Bill was originally on the board but stepped down when VectoIQ took the company public.

The company’s stock prospectus said that Nikola had awarded more than 3 million stock options “to recognize the superior performance and contribution of specific employees.” The list included Travis Milton and an uncle, Lance Milton, the document said, acknowledging that they are relatives.

As Milton went public with Nikola’s technology, questions soon arose involving his claims about the company’s fuel-cell system. He bragged in an investor video in 2019 that the company had created “what other manufacturers said was impossible to design.” But while Nikola holds patents in fuel-cell and battery technology, most of its planned hardware was coming from German supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh.

Nikola Demonstrations

It became clear that Milton had gotten ahead of himself. A 2016 demonstration showed a truck that didn’t have a working hydrogen-fuel-cell system and was missing key parts, people familiar with the matter said in June. Milton said at the time that the parts were removed as a safety precaution.

In July of this year, he recorded a video of the semi truck in which he ran alongside the vehicle as it coasted at low speeds in a parking lot. Aping Musk’s combative social-media persona, Milton took a shot at his detractors saying, “these damned trolls, I wonder if they are going to apologize to everyone for the lies they spread the tens of thousands of comments about how fake we are.”

Girsky said in the webcast “Autoline This Week,” in which Bloomberg participated, that he has been in Nikola’s fuel-cell trucks and that they work.

Still, when the GM deal was done, GM will be supplying all of the technology for every global market except Europe. Nikola’s pickup truck, called Badger, will use GM’s Ultium battery, and the semis will run on a fuel cell developed by GM and Honda Motor Co.

Since Milton’s departure, Nikola has billed itself more as an integrator of other technologies into its Badger pickup and semi trucks.

For GM’s part, the automaker is protected from any financial downside. GM got 11 per cent of the stock for no cash investment and gets paid for its technology. If Nikola fails, GM won’t lose a dime.

Milton has remained silent and is out of the company. He unknowingly presaged his own downfall in the June interview with Bloomberg: “Part of becoming a better person in life is losing everything you have got and having nothing left.”

maqmx6,investing,JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from Institutions,"Article from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.",2021-03-22 15:44:47,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590745,1070 days 06:48:17.590746,180,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/maqmx6/jp_morgan_may_soon_turn_away_deposits_from/

s5mupa,investing,Why aren't more people in their 60's in the US millionaires?,"According to a compounding calculator I just tried, someone who starts with $0 at age 25 and adds 10k a year until age 60 to an investment account with a yearly average ROI of 5% will end up with just shy of a million at age 60. 5% is a fairly conservative estimated yearly return.

But according to this net worth by age calculator, only 20% of people in their 60's in the US are millionaires in terms of net worth. https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator-united-states/

**I'm certainly not saying that everyone is in a position to add 10k per year to an investment account**, but I'd have thought that more than 20% of the population would be in a position to do that. **Plus this is a net worth calculator that counts home equity, meaning home value is included in the estimate for home owners**

So what's going on here? Are more people living paycheck to paycheck than I realize? Are people just really not that good at saving much?


**EDIT:** here are some more conservative numbers. If you start at age 30 (rather than 25) and save 5k per year, with a fairly conservative estimate of 5% returns per year which arguably accounts for a few % of inflation each year, you'd have 350k by age 60 and 634k by age 70, which according to the calculator linked above is a lot closer to the median percentile (60-70 percentile in this case)

**EDIT 2:** For any latecomers to this thread, some people have preferred numbers like investing 1k a year for 35 years at 10% return from age 30 to 65. This would put someone right at the 52 percentile and yield them around 300k by age 65 (or closer to 500k by age 70). So this seems to be about what the average person has pulled off.

k7cnl9,investing,A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”,"We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them.

 But the thing is, they are a great way to materialize your returns without actually having to sell anything. I do not like selling. A lot of blue chips pay 1-3% and some stocks like reits a bit more so you basically have a bond and if the economy goes well, sweet capital gains, a big company doesn t have to be a boring company (I made more gains this year with VW than with PTLR). Also it is a great signal that the company is doing well.

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade. 

**Additional lesson:** When multiple mainstream business publications are pushing the same narrative on their covers it often pays to go the other way.",2021-03-12 13:29:59,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590787,1080 days 09:03:05.590787,474,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3hkd2/david_rosenberg_says_there_will_be_no_roaring_20s/

So I will ask here, in ADDITION to all of the companies I’m high on listed below, I would like your opinions on PLTR. If you don’t have one, that’s cool too. Not trying to mislead anyone like I was accused of.

I like Lithium America (LAC), iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), and Novus (NOVS) which will soon become AppHarvest, possibly the future of North American agriculture. 

I’ve been doing my research lately and just bought 100 shares of each. Not the biggest investment in the world but not small by any means. I’m big on anything renewable and have no problem playing the long-term game. I actually prefer it. 

How do you all feel about these? 

Also, additional opinions I would love from any of you would be your thoughts on Sunrun (RUN), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), and First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF (FAN). I am very high on all of these over the next 5 years. 

Thanks in advance, and I’m still learning along with everyone else. Warren Buffett said, invest in what you know, and it’s better to get a good company at an okay price, than an okay company at a good price. I’m less concerned about the week to week or month to month, and more so confident in renewable energy taking over during the next decade. It’s not a matter of opinion, and it’s not if, but when!

Edit: Article 

When it comes to companies exposed to emerging markets -- most notably China -- investors should beware the lack of visibility into their books, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said Tuesday.

Foreign jurisdictions aren’t maintaining adequate standards of investor protection, and the U.S. has little control over that, Clayton and other officials said in a strongly worded statement. The group also underlined a longstanding point of conflict: that the main U.S. accounting watchdog can’t inspect the work that Chinese auditors do for companies that sell stock in American markets.

“In many emerging markets, including China, there is substantially greater risk that disclosures will be incomplete or misleading” and substantially less access to recourse in the event of investor harm, said the statement from four SEC officials and William Duhnke, chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.


The issue over inspections of Chinese accounting firms dates back more than a decade and has always been a point of tension between the two countries. While U.S. regulators can access work papers underlying audits in most countries, China’s prohibition hampers their ability to conduct investigations and inspections designed to catch mistakes or malfeasance by auditors.

In December 2018, Clayton and Duhnke issued a joint statement saying that U.S. regulators “currently face significant challenges” in overseeing the financial reporting for listed companies based in China. They said that among auditors of 224 companies with total market capitalization of $1.8 trillion that posed obstacles for U.S. inspectors, 213 were in China or Hong Kong.

Tensions with China have been rising as Republicans, under pressure as critics assail President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, accuse the Asian nation of failing to give sufficient warning about the pandemic and offering misleading information about its severity.

Though the auditing issue hasn’t always been on the front burner, companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. have raised billions of dollars in the U.S. while avoiding regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq earlier this month halted trading in Luckin Coffee Inc., a Chinese chain enmeshed in an accounting scandal, and said the shares will remain frozen until the company satisfies requests for information.

In their Tuesday statement, the U.S. regulators said investors should especially consider the potential effects of the PCAOB’s blind spot in China.

“Even when the auditor signing the audit report is not based in China, if the company has operations in China, investors should consider whether significant portions of the audit may have been performed by firms in China,” the group said.


The PCAOB keeps a list of companies whose auditors it can’t inspect on its website.",2020-04-22 11:02:03,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590833,1404 days 11:31:01.590833,206,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g5z4cm/china_called_out_in_us_warning_over_emerging/

KEY POINTS

- Ninety-five percent of spot bitcoin trading volume is faked by unregulated exchanges, according to a study from Bitwise this week.

- The firm analyzed the top 81 crypto exchanges by volume on industry site CoinMarketCap.com. They report an aggregated $6 billion in average daily bitcoin volume. The study finds that only $273 million of that is legitimate. 

- ""People looked at cryptocurrency and said this market is a mess; that's because they were looking at data that was manipulated,"" says Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise. ""When you cut away the echo chamber of these nonsense numbers, it should be an efficient, well-arbitraged market.""

- The analysis showed that ""substantially all of the volume"" reported on 71 out of the 81 exchanges was wash trading, a term that describes a person simultaneously selling and buying the same stock, or bitcoin in this case, to create the appearance of activity in the market. In other words, it's not real.",2019-12-30 14:05:14,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590883,1518 days 08:27:50.590884,471,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ehmf2o/majority_of_bitcoin_trading_is_a_hoax_new_study/

foextf,investing,"Don't be misguided, markets bottom will be signalled by low VIX and actual economic data, not huge rallies","Today is pure optimism and the reaction to good news (or what looks like good news). Fiscal stimulus is anything but certain by tomorrow, FED is doing unlimited QE, and Trump thinks the US can open up by Easter.

Fiscal stimulus takes time to kick in and for many people and businesses comes a week too late. It helps putting money in the pockets but doesn't suddenly restart the economic apparatus -only consumer and investment confidence do that.

Unlimited QE is like fishing with dynamite: quick results but a lot of underlying damage. lts worth noting that this is not a financial crisis but a public health crisis with financial implications. The FED can at best alleviate some symptoms but that's it.

The US is not testing nearly as fast as Korea (17 times less tests per capita when I checked this weekend), nor is it taking the lockdown serious. Unless a million tests appear by this weekend so the virus can be traced and narrowed down, Trump has to face the reality that he either locks down fully now or blows this crisis out of imaginable proportions in less than a month by opening.

So in my opinion, how does a bottom look like? 20-30% drop from the current level, with decreasing volatility starting in one or two weeks when the spread of the virus becomes more clear and the economic data hits us hard. Shy but ever more common gains and then more big rallies than drops (but not 10% if that's what you want).

We've only had one VIX spike, in 2008 there were 3. Also plenty of examples of fake rallies like today's and the first Friday of the month. The sp500 was grossly overpriced in February, so whatever it fell until the first days of March was barely an overdue correction. Now you have to input recession to get the true dimension of the collapse.

Disclaimer: this is just my opinion and I'm not offering investment advice

Edit: just to clarify I don't expect vix under 20 this year. When I say low I mean 30s perhaps 40s. I also know markets recover before clear good news begin. When I say let the economic data hit us I'm talking of at least having an actual dimension of the problem, so March and April readings.",2020-03-24 22:45:02,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590897,1432 days 23:48:02.590898,293,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/foextf/dont_be_misguided_markets_bottom_will_be/

Not every market dip has some correlation to a news story.","Saw a lot of this yesterday when the markets dipped.  There was no story.  It didn't have anything to do with a government shutdown, or China, or a butterfly flapping its wings two days ago somewhere in Europe.

The market simply overextended on euphoric, greedy trading, which happens frequently, and then corrected itself.  I'm usually not a huge fan of technical indicators, but the bollinger bands (or even just the 20-day moving average) will [show you the stretches and corrections](https://i.imgur.com/cIe0ErO.png).  Further, the mounting buying volume, although punctuated by occasional spikes of selling pressure, shows us that the market will continue to rise after this retracement has finished.

We're all human, and it's natural for us to find the cause and effect, and to look for the meaning behind everything.  But grasping at straws for news events to explain these types of price movements shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the way prices move in a market.  In turn, that lack of understanding may lead to unfavorable outcomes for your portfolio.

Often, these price extensions and retracements occur for the same reason that your friend who is always 15 minutes late to everything was late to work yesterday.  It's just typical behavior.

El Salvador, the only country in which bitcoin is a legal tender, is going to build an entire city based on the largest cryptocurrency, President Nayib Bukele said in a Saturday night presentation at Bitcoin Week in El Salvador.

“Bitcoin City” will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. The government plans on locating a power plant by the volcano to provide energy for both the city and bitcoin mining, the president said.

According to Bukele, Bitcoin City will be a full-fledged metropolis with residential and commercial areas, restaurants, an airport as well as a port and rail service. The city will be laid out in a circle (like a coin) and in the city center will be a plaza that will be host to a huge bitcoin symbol. The city will have no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes.

Bukele also said El Salvador plans on issuing $1 billion US “bitcoin bond,” a tokenized financial instrument developed by Blockstream, on the Liquid Network. Of that amount, $500 million will be used to help construct needed energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure and $500 million to buy even more bitcoin. At the cryptocurrency’s recent trading price of about $59,000, that would bring the country’s treasury stash to just under 2,000 bitcoins.

The Shenzhen component plunged 9.03% in the opening minutes while the Shenzhen composite fell 8.882%. The Shanghai composite dropped 8.6%, according to Reuters.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.59%. The Topix index also declined 1.25%. South Korea’s Kospi also shed 1.46%.

Meanwhile, shares in Australia tumbled as well, with the S&P/ASX 200 dropping 1.69%.
Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index traded 1.39% lower.

Investors will be bracing for the return of trade for mainland Chinese stocks at 9:30 a.m. HK/SIN on Monday, following an extended holiday amid an ongoing virus outbreak that has taken more than 300 lives in the country so far.

The People’s Bank of China announced Sunday that it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan (approx. $173 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via open market reverse repo operations. The Chinese central bank said the overall liquidity in the system would be 900 billion yuan (approx. $130 billion) more as compared to the same period last year.

“While this will be the largest single-day addition since 2004, it implies a mere net injection of RMB150bn as commercial banks are scheduled to repay RMB1.05tn of funds on Monday,” strategists at Singapore’s DBS Group Research wrote in a note. “The authority may need to inject more cash in the rest of the week via reverse repo and/or medium-term lending facility to soothe market nerves.”

7helez,investing,Senate tax bill may contain a major threat to long term investors,"I was given a heads up about this by my cousin, who is a private broker and investment consultant, and then got a message straight to my brokerage account. 

Below is the quoted message from TD Ameritrade/Scottrade. They stay as nonpartisan as possible, given the spectrum of their clientele, so we should all probably take heed when they are taking a stand on a specific piece of legislation:

""Dear Valued Client, 

TD Ameritrade believes it's important to stand on the side of our clients. We have reviewed the Senate Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was released last week. Section 13533 of the Senate Bill imposes a single cost basis methodology for investors, ""first in, first out"" (""FIFO""), on all sales of securities (except mutual funds). 

For the average investor, this means possibly being required to pay the highest capital gains taxes where a stock has appreciated over time. 

On behalf of our approximately 11 million client accounts, we strongly oppose this provision. We believe it will harm individual investors by eliminating their freedom to decide when to take losses or gains on their investments, potentially resulting in an increased tax burden. 

An Example 

Suppose you hold a significant amount of a company's stock, accumulated over a 20-year career. You're now retired, and you want to sell some company stock to diversify your portfolio. Assume the purchases over time range from $5 per share up to $90 per share, but the stock now is trading at $50. 

If you sell at $50, rather than being able to take losses on the stock purchased above $50, the Senate Bill could require you to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation of the stock from $5 to $50. That is, even if you have experienced sizeable paper losses on the purchases above $50, the Senate Bill might force you to pay taxes calculated on the largest gains possible. 

We don't think that's fair. We feel the Senate should stand up on behalf of individual investors and reject imposing a FIFO cost basis requirement on sales of securities. 

What Can You Do?



If you are concerned about these changes, we encourage you to contact your congressional representatives today and make your voice heard. We have created a site so that individual investors like you can stay informed and easily reach out to your government representatives on issues that matter to you. You'll find a summary of current issues there, along with template letters to help get you started. 

TD Ameritrade believes in providing our clients with a voice on issues that stand to impact their ability to confidently save, invest, and plan for the future. We are on the frontlines, communicating your interests to those who can influence policy and bring about change. 

By coming together, we can have a more meaningful impact. Please join the conversation.""",2017-12-04 03:13:30,2024-02-25 22:33:04.590976,2274 days 19:19:34.590977,426,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7helez/senate_tax_bill_may_contain_a_major_threat_to/

If approved, each NVIDIA (NVDA) shareholder of record at the close of business on June 21 will receive a dividend of three additional shares for every share held, which will be distributed after the close of trading on July 19.",2021-05-21 20:53:29,2024-02-25 22:33:04.591038,1010 days 01:39:35.591039,270,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ni2mjv/nvidia_proposes_4for1_stock_split/
901dyr,investing,White House latest budget projections call for a 2019 Federal budget deficit over $1 trillion.,"Economic growth is not turning out to be as robust as originally estimated so 2019 appears to be primed for [a massive federal budget shortfall](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397445-white-house-budget-projects-1-trillion-deficit-in-2019). This is concerning for several reasons.... 1) We are currently in an economic expansion. This is the time for fiscal restraint to have a rainy day fund set aside for future recessions. 2) The current 2019 projections could get revised much lower if the economy slows down at all in the next couple of quarters. 3) Some cures for budget shortfalls are either to cut spending or increase taxes... both of which are going to be a headwind for future economic growth. 

If one estimates equity returns of 7-9% for the next 10-20 years, I would imagine this news would dampen that enthusiasm. Maybe 5-7% is more likely with a real return of 2-3%. Unfortunately fixed income and real estate both appear to be priced dearly at the moment so where does one look for decent inflation adjusted returns over the next 10-20 years? Diversification across all asset classes including lots of international appears to be prudent at the moment IMHO. 

Edit - Apparently people are somewhat confused about the difference between that US national debt and the federal deficit. The national debt is the total debt owed by the federal government (I believe it is around $20 trillion). The annual deficit, is the amount we are adding to the national debt each year (tax revenue minus federal spending). Starting in 2009-2010 the deficit was gradually declining each year until this year. It appears to be back on an increasing trajectory.

126n5a0,investing,"Just something to keep in mind as I'm seeing a LOT of misinfo recently: Most people suggesting USD reserve currency status is in jeopardy, or any shade of collapsing / falling apart are groups who are trying to profit from this.","I'm posting this since I've been seeing an increasing chorus of junk analysis suggesting that the US dollar is in decline, or collapsing, or that the USA is going to lose reserve currency status any time soon. 

You don't have to be a us dollar bull to realize that there are a LOT of vested interests out there spreading this narrative in an attempt to profiteer off it. I don't know if this is at all coordinated, but there is 100% a new wave of either misinformation spreading, or people who are probably uninformed  regurgitating talking points from misinformation sources (looking at you Fareed Zakaria). 

Most of what I've seen is coming from bitcoin bros, tech accelerationists, or Russia / China aligned sources. Not to say that's all there is, but when it comes to amplifying a narrative, I think that is a big core of this. 

And just to reiterate, you don't have to be bullish on the US dollar to recognize that it's not about to collapse and that there is a LOT of misinfo purposely trying to sell a narrative here. 

Note when looking at anything on social media that a lot of this type of analysis starts with some type of embedded assumption that the US Dollar is collapsing.

of26bq,investing,I experimented with committing to a $25 dollar per week investment in TSLA for at least a year and here are my results.,"Last year I challenged myself to invest at least $25 automatically in Tesla each week using a recurring transfer. I figured it would be a good way to build up my investment in the company while taking a manageable risk and potentially getting some market gains. Since my brokerage offered partial share investments I figured it would be a fun way to see where my money was in a year.

After 1 year here are my results:

Start Date: July 6, 2020

Initial investment: $30 (.023017 shares at 1,300.38 edit: after 5:1 split ~$260)

July 6 2021 Investment Value: $2,546.70

Total Invested with Auto-Transfer: $1,300

Total Return: $697 (+37.64%)

Extra periodic market buys: ~$550

Average Cost of entire stake: $447.40

Current price of Stock: 657.54 (about 150% gain since initial investment date)

Conclusion: Although it would have been great to be able to increase my investment on each dip, having the recurring transfer helped me take advantage of the partial share feature offered by my brokerage and keep my average cost low. During the same time period SPY gained about 36% edit: however, the only way to have gained 36% would have been to have had the $1300 I invested back last July. Otherwise, with the same auto transfer method the gains would have been 17% in SPY. Still a good return but 19% lower than the higher risk TSLA investment(math below in another edit). Although it would have been nice to be able put $1300 back in July 2020 and see it more than double, because I didn't have cash on hand, I only got about 1/3 of the potential gains of holding the stock the entire time. This gamble netted more than having the money in spy, but I guess that’s the risk premium. I am happy with the results of my little experiment and plan to continue this process and add a few more dollars per week into other companies and ETF's that I feel strongly about.

Let me know your thoughts. I know this isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it's a small look into what you can do if you are literally storing the equivalent of 3 lunch meals a week in an investment account. Obviously one side note, the biggest downside to this way of investing is that my tax lots are all over the place and if I have to sell, I have an ongoing 1 year rolling date for ""long"" tax rates but, I don't plan on selling any time soon, so as time goes on, that will be less of an issue.

Edit: Forgot to add a little more context: I currently have $150 a month going into a Traditional IRA, 9% of my income going into a 457 (~350 per check 2x a month) and a bunch that goes into my public servant pension. In addition to that, I regularly put ~200-300 into various stocks and ETF's that I hold each month. Although this investment represents a small amount of what I invest and save, it was probably the most exciting thing to watch all year.

Edit 2: this was posted as a comment but here it is here too. 

A number of people point out that the price of the s&p has gone up YOY an amount equivalent to what I earned on this investment. Now a couple disclaimers: I don’t believe that this is a viable investment option for someone to do with their whole check. But here is an apples to apples comparison (excluding dividend which wouldn’t only affect it a few bucks since we are dealing with such a small amount.) But, here is the apples to apples comparison. This is using the weekly open price on yahoo finance for a year investing $25 per week. Again not trying to say this a better investment than spy, I don’t think it is but this is apples to apples.

koyjya,investing,Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

mwvqvk,investing,Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunity,"Leave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",2021-04-23 13:52:42,2024-02-25 22:33:04.591249,1038 days 08:40:22.591249,638,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mwvqvk/fear_of_capital_gains_tax_presents_a_buying/

cs6pwh,investing,"Recession fears, recession reality","I've been an investor through two of the past recessions. I can't say if another one is looming, near, or not close at all. My ability to predict the market is as bad as anyone's.

However, hearing all the fear and hype, and seeing the Great Flight to bonds and commodities and other instruments, it causes me to reflect on what I see happening now, vs. what I remember from the past.

So, when real recessions were underway here's what I remember:

1. People were not universally warning me to avoid stocks. If anything, bubble hype was so great that I was told I ""couldn't lose"" by investing in tech, or real estate, or whatever else was fashionable at the time. I remember one friend actually becoming angry when I suggested that real estate was as susceptible to market uncertainty as anything else.

2. My company stopped giving out bonuses and raises, for years. People were laid off during successive waves of ""restructuring"". Recruiters called less often. Jobs were harder to find. Many of my friends had difficulty finding new work, or were out of jobs for months. There was a feeling of things ""drying up"".

3. During the last recession, Europe became rather expensive to visit (1.47 EUR/USD in Dec 2008). In general, purchasing power felt like it was... less, though this could have just been psychological.

In short, the recession environment made life feel like it was becoming more difficult. Whereas in the current climate, borrowing is still easy, interest rates are low, recruiters are calling, companies  pay competitively, my friends are taking trips and vacations and spending their money.

But if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.

It's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.

My biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. 

Fuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back. 

Sure, it's good to see what's new once in a while, learn what other people think. But basing your financial moves on other people, even if it's Warren Buffet will make you lose money in the long term.

jlkkup,investing,Bloomberg article anticipates the US stock market could be headed for a lost decade,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/personal-finance-what-if-stocks-don-t-always-go-up-advice-for-young-investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/personal-finance-what-if-stocks-don-t-always-go-up-advice-for-young-investors)

This article is definitely concerning and brings up some good points. I don’t know that you can bet on tripling your investment, but I feel safe assuming that it’ll grow considerably given that many people’s current cost basis is based on the fire sale that the COVID recession brought at the beginning. And really the market is doing so bad right now because COVID cases are rising because it’s winter, but once it starts to heat up and COVID cases aren’t spiking the way they currently are I’m sure the market will regain some territory - or at least not be pinned down the way it currently is. And it seems like his assessment was generally a response to the conventional advice that you can guarantee returns by investing in an index fund that follows the S&P 500 or investing in the big tech companies (and there is definitely a concern that they could be harmed by anti-trust suits). But I think it depends on what you’re investing in. 

Like if you’re in airlines they’re directly affected, probably more than any other industry, by COVID restrictions. Their earnings have been shit because of it and once people aren’t afraid to travel I just don’t see how their earnings and then share value don’t go up. If you wanted to hedge against the sort of losses he talks about I would probably sell once they start announcing vaccines coming out because I’d be surprised if the market didn’t drive prices up with their optimism that that means everything is going back to normal. On top of that, when he says that the market in 2012 still wasn’t above its 2000 peak it’s a bit disingenuous because when you look at the S&P over the past 20 years he’s right, but 2000 was a peak (at about 1491), then after a dip, the market went to a high of about 1535 in 2007, then the market crashed in 08 and started recovering and he just picked an arbitrary point in that recovery that proved his point but which became irrelevant the very next year, in 2013, when the market DID exceed 2000 levels and then boomed over the next 7 years to more than double what it was in 2000 or 2006.

Regarding what he said about big tech companies, yeah I would probably stay out of tech. Those companies already have such a high share price that I’ve always been skeptical of jumping in anyway. He also says globalization is in retreat, and I think that’s a bit of a hasty conclusion. I think we’re definitely at a crossroads where we’re trying to determine if we’re going to dive headfirst into a more globalist orientation or retreat and be more isolationist, but I’m skeptical that in the longer term we aren’t going to be more globalist in orientation. But I do think we’re in for a bit of identity seeking as it pertains to whether we’re going to be more globalist or isolationist, because if you recall TPP had pretty steep opposition on both sides of the aisle - but not so much that Obama wasn’t willing to pursue it. And I think the luster of isolationism has probably been tarnished a bit by Trump. Though globalism is really one of those things, just like anti-racism and shit like that, where this election seems to sort of serve as a referendum on it. 

Trump is certainly not a fan of globalism, but Biden seems at least more globally oriented and has at least in some cases shown an inclination towards reviving Obama-era policies that Trump dismantled because Biden was part of the Obama era so his legacy is sorta tied up in that as well, and one of those policies was TPP. As far as workers demanding a fairer split of capitalism, that’s fair. I do anticipate things like wage hikes, but that could also result in people spending more because they have more (i.e. Keynesianism). I also think it’s a fair point about the aging demographics thing. It makes sense that boomers would want to divest themselves of riskier stocks and people just haven’t been having kids as much as they used to, so the working-age population is surely going to feel that bite at some point (though I’m not sure when). However, the US has long been an exception to the rule of shitty population growth rates in the west. In general, we don’t have a ton of kids, but where we have historically differed is that we attract a lot of immigrants so our population grows that way - and Biden has already stated that he’s going to be reversing some of Trump’s immigration policies.

gf16kn,investing,"A wave of bankruptcies, surging taxes, and Americans harboring lasting scars from coronavirus lockdowns — the head of world’s largest asset manager warns of grim outlook","BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

Is cash king again?

* Total net assets in money market funds rose to $4.814 trillion in the week ended Jan. 4, according to the [Investment Company Institute](https://www.ici.org/research/stats/mmf). That eclipses the prior peak of $4.79 trillion during May 2020, back in the earlier months of Covid-19. 
* Investors, worried about earnings and interest rates, may be willing to wait before they put more money into stocks. At the same time, money market funds are actually generating a few percentage points of income for the first time in years.

That means investors may be finding a safer way to generate some return while they wait for the right moment to invest.

Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said the surge into money markets was a direct result of selling stocks at year end.

>“If you look at the flow data for the middle of December, liquidations were on the order of March 2020,” he said. “In the short-term, it was a very contrarian buy signal. To me this was people basically selling the market at the end of the year, and they just parked it in the money market funds. If the selling continues, they’ll park more.”

\--------------------

My two cents: If you give investors a chance to make decent/solid returns (4-7%) on risk-free investments, a noticeable portion of them will move their money out of the volatile stock market. 4.8 trillion is a massive amount of money. Fidelity's (one of the largest brokerage firms in the world) entire assets under management are 4.5 trillion.

ooxtsf,investing,Robinhood faces 'looming regulatory risk' as it gears up for its IPO,"Yahoo News: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-faces-a-looming-regulatory-risk-as-it-gears-up-for-its-ipo-161007770.html

The retail trading platform Robinhood is reportedly planning to start trading on the Nasdaq next week, making a public debut that comes with an unusually heavy dose of legal and regulatory disclosures. 

Robinhood, which expects a market value of $33 billion, faces ""numerous litigation matters,"" according to a recent securities filing. Those lawsuits, likely to be consolidated if permitted to move forward, include roughly 50 proposed class actions tied to its decision to restrict trading in GameStop (GME) and other so-called meme stocks in early 2021, according to the filing, which Robinhood submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. 

The platform — whose stated goal is to ""democratize finance for all"" by offering commission-free trading — said it faces 15 proposed class actions over outages in March 2020. It also said it faces a half-dozen proposed class actions over a controversial practice called payment for order flow, which enables brokerages to make money despite not charging commissions.

But the regulatory risk that Robinhood faces could outweigh even this mountain of pending lawsuits against the platform, one expert said. Indeed, the company's new registration filing mentioned the word “regulation” 215 times. And many of those lawsuits might be dismissed, according to University of Michigan Law School professor Adam Pritchard. 

“There are a bunch of lawsuits out there,” Pritchard said. “For a lot of them, there's not much to them.”

Robinhood's filing pointed to proposed class actions filed on behalf of what could amount to millions of consumers, and another lawsuit filed by Massachusetts' attorney general. Both target Robinhood’s “payment for order flow” fee arrangement, claiming the company failed to inform customers that its commission free trades are supported by payments to broker-dealers.

Ultimately, the suits claim the fees disadvantaged Robinhood consumers by pushing their trading costs higher. So far, the practice has resulted in Robinhood reaching a $65 million settlement with the SEC. Separately the company was fined $57 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for allegedly violating brokerage industry rules. (Robinhood ""accepted"" the settlement with FINRA but did not admit or deny the allegations.)

The risk from regulators like these could be a greater threat than the many pending lawsuits, according to University of Notre Dame associate law school professor Patrick Corrigan. 

“First is Robinhood’s history of regulatory enforcement actions,” Corrigan said. “They've had settlements with the SEC, with FINRA — and they're facing actions from several state governments.”

“Second, Robinood's business model and practices push the boundaries of what broker dealers are currently doing with customers,” he said. That, he explained, separates the company from traditional financial services companies and underlies why regulators continue to probe the company’s tactics.

**'An alarming risk' for investors**

The company came under intense scrutiny in February when lawmakers on the House Financial Services committee publicly questioned Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev about the company’s payment for order flow revenue model — its largest source of revenue — and its advertising practices.

Pritchard, the University of Michigan law professor, said that while the collection of uncertainties is not ideal for a company that’s going public, Robinhood’s filing shows financial backers appear undeterred, despite the negative media coverage .

“If you were contemplating an IPO...you [normally] wouldn’t choose the point where you had just been hammered by the media and Congress in the last six months,” Pritchard said.

“It's not customary for a company that's just doing its IPO to have this much on its docket, that it needs to disclose, but you can be certain that the underwriters have talked to prospective investors, and don't think that it's insurmountable,” he added.

Still, David Trainer, CEO of the investment firm New Constructs, said Robinhood’s “mounting regulatory risk"" should be a red flag for investors and that the stock should be worth no more than $9 billion.

""Robinhood will likely not be able to continue the robust growth it saw in 2020 due to looming regulatory risk, increasing competition, and an undifferentiated service,"" he wrote. ""If regulators were ever to outlaw payment for order flow, Robinhood’s revenue would be severely affected, creating an alarming risk for investors.""

141hq4s,investing,A $1.5 Trillion Backstop for Homebuyers Props Up Banks Instead,"From bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-04/us-effort-to-help-homebuyers-get-affordable-loans-mainly-benefits-banks-instead

>The first sign of deep trouble in US banking this year came from a sunbaked office complex in a San Diego suburb. There, a small firm called Silvergate Capital Corp. assured investors it was weathering a run on deposits. Its lifeline: about $4.3 billion from a Federal Home Loan Bank.

>Heads turned across the financial industry.

>Silvergate didn’t have a network of branches serving consumers, and it barely offered mortgages. It specialized in moving dollars for cryptocurrency ventures. 

>Soon it became apparent that a roster of troubled regional banks was leaning on FHLBs — a relic of the Great Depression originally aimed at ensuring financial firms have cash to lend to homebuyers. Yet the banks had little to do with everyday mortgage lending. 

>Silicon Valley Bank, catering to venture capitalists and tech startups, said it held $15 billion from an FHLB at the end of 2022. Signature Bank, with clients including crypto platforms, had $11 billion. And by April,  First Republic Bank, offering mortgages to millionaires on unusually sweet terms, ended up with more than $28 billion. All four banks collapsed.

>For many, that was a crystallizing moment for the 90-year-old Federal Home Loan Bank system, which has ballooned to more than $1.5 trillion while playing a growing role as a backstop for banks taking all kinds of risks — and a diminishing role in funding new mortgages. That’s raising questions about the purpose of FHLBs and why the private institutions enjoy so much government support.

>This look at the system is based on interviews with more than 30 current and former FHLB officials, overseers, borrowers and other market participants, most of them speaking on the condition they not be named to candidly discuss confidential experiences. Many described an environment where loans are made quickly with little due diligence, generating billions of dollars a year in profits for FHLBs and the banks they serve — plus millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation for their own executives.

>It’s hard to imagine the Federal Reserve rewarding bosses for arranging industry bailouts, but that is in effect what now happens at FHLBs.

>The FHLB of San Francisco, for example, more than doubled its assets last year as Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and others embarked on their borrowing binges. Its chief executive officer, Teresa Bazemore, was awarded $2.4 million — much of it in bonuses — during 2022, her first full year atop the institution. SVB and First Republic now rank as the second- and third-largest bank failures in US history.

>Bazemore's pay was tied to goals and other metrics the San Francisco FHLB's board set in consultation with a third-party expert and showed to regulators, said Elliot Sloane, a spokesperson for the San Francisco FHLB. “The level of advances to a member is based on a careful, thoughtful and conservative underwriting approach that takes all the relevant risk factors into account. That is our congressionally directed function,” Sloane said.

>Many of the largest banks also have become accustomed to drawing financing from FHLBs, even as they pull back from lending to US homebuyers.

>Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. — among the system’s biggest users since 2010 — collectively tapped at least $62 billion during last year’s relatively sedate markets. Citigroup’s $19 billion amounted to 3% of the total cash pool, while the firm originated only 0.3% of the nation’s mortgages in 2022, according to bank regulatory filings and federal mortgage records. Wells Fargo borrowed $32 billion before announcing in January that it’s slashing mortgage operations.

>The lion’s share of US home loans are instead issued by nonbanks, such as Rocket Mortgage, which sell them to free up cash to make new loans. 

>Those businesses generally aren’t eligible to tap the FHLB system.

>More than 80% of the top 100 FHLB users borrowed more from the system than they loaned out as mortgages. Fourteen banks reported no originations.

>One quirk of the system is that the government’s assistance doesn’t appear as a line in the US budget — sparing FHLBs the kinds of bitter congressional debates over expenditures that have gripped Washington in recent months.

>Instead, government support starts with special treatment, giving FHLBs an edge in raising money cheaply. They gather most of their funding by selling bonds exempt from state and local income taxes. Buyers are also more comfortable with the debt because of the widespread assumption that if an FHLB ever runs into trouble, the government would jump in with taxpayer money to prevent default. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have said their credit ratings for the FHLB system would be several notches lower if not for the government's presumed backing.

>“The implied guarantee is also not something that's conveyed by the government,” Ryan Donovan, CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, said in an interview. “It's something the market perceives, that we're a safe place, that our debt that we issue is solid.”

>Economists vigorously debate the value of the government’s support. Defenders of the system, such as former White House adviser Jim Parrott and economist Mark Zandi, estimate it was worth around $5 billion last year, while detractors peg the boost closer to $9 billion. Some of that is passed on to banks as a discounted source of financing. It also translates into higher profits for the FHLBs, which last year produced $3.2 billion in net income.

>They held on to more than half that, lifting their stockpile of retained earnings to $24.6 billion.

>A portion — about $1.4 billion — was paid banks and other “members” as dividends. 

>In the end, the $1.5 trillion FHLB system contributed a mere $355 million to a program supporting housing affordability last year.

>“It’s embarrassing,” said Cornelius Hurley, an independent director on the board of Boston’s FHLB for about 14 years through 2021. “This is a public entity. We should be demanding more from them.”

>Defenders acknowledge that the system is a quirk of history but say its ability to provide funding quickly is crucial, especially when crises erupt. FHLBs can start stabilizing lenders before they resort to tapping the Fed’s discount window, and before policymakers can meet to discuss other extraordinary measures.

>Banks that do tap the discount window have to worry about stoking the very same public panic they are trying to quell.

>“The members certainly could go to the Fed,” said Michael Ericson, CEO of the Chicago FHLB. “The challenge is there is a reputation risk associated with that. In talking with member institutions, they feel that the stigma is real.”

>FHLBs didn’t always provide cash so freely. The system was almost comically risk-averse when President Herbert Hoover signed the law for its creation in 1932. In the first two years, hopeful borrowers filled out 41,000 applications for mortgages funded with FHLB money. Three were approved.

>Back then, thrifts and insurers were the biggest lenders to homebuyers. The firms were supposed to go to local FHLBs and pledge collateral — such as home loans — to borrow cash and make additional mortgages.

>But by the late 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt’s administration was creating an even simpler system: A new entity, Fannie Mae, would buy mortgages. About three decades later, Congress chartered Freddie Mac to help thrifts manage interest-rate risks. The pair gave rise to the mortgage-securities market, which funds most home loans today.

>But in the 1980s, the savings and loan crisis erupted, prompting a government bailout. With so many thrifts failing, the FHLBs were losing too many members to sustain themselves. So in 1989, George H.W. Bush’s administration reached a deal to expand the FHLB system to serve thousands of banks — on the condition that 10% of profits would go toward supporting housing affordability.

>FHLBs fought that requirement at the time, people involved in that process said. They now tout it as a core piece of their mission.
Sticking to the Mandate

>FHLBs have to set aside 10% of their profit for affordable housing grant programs. They rarely do more.

>The number of lenders using FHLBs more than doubled to more than 8,000 by 2005 — while the system’s balance sheet swelled about sixfold to $1 trillion.

>But after the 2008 financial crisis, the nation’s largest banks began pulling back en masse from mortgage lending.

>Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Citigroup collectively originated 4% of residential mortgages in the country in 2022, down from 13% in 2010. Rocket Mortgage increased its market share over the same period.

>Still, FHLBs continued to swell as banks sought financing, especially in emergencies. The system’s total loans to members surged 28% to $1.04 trillion in this year’s first three months, beating a record set in the third quarter of 2008.

>“What the home loan banks have become is a source of general liquidity to big banks,” said Bruce Morrison, former chair of the Federal Housing Finance Board. “They’ve made a great contribution for the last 50 years, but the market has changed. They’re doing a job that the Fed should be doing.”

>Most Americans aren’t familiar with the arcane system.

>A software engineer from a think tank recently went on National Public Radio’s “The Indicator” to take a quiz about this year’s turmoil in US banking. Asked to identify the industry’s “lender of second-to-last resort” from a list, she paused on the correct answer: the FHLB system.

>“Sounds made-up,” she said.

>When deposit runs at regional banks began making headlines around the world in March, few eyes were on the FHLBs as they furiously raised money to meet the incoming demand to aid banks, issuing $304 billion of debt in one week alone.

>“People underestimate how much value they bring,” said Ted Tozer, the former president of Ginnie Mae. “The record number of advances this year when there was contagion shows a lot of it happens under the covers. The FHLBs are the shock absorbers.”

>FHLBs can react so quickly because it’s hard for them to lose. They have a so-called super lien on the money they lend, putting them at the front of the line to get repaid if a bank collapses. The FHLBs note that any secured lender would take priority in the event of a bank failure.

>But insiders say the super lien contributes to features of FHLB loans that can make them especially egregious. It's not uncommon for banks to bend accounting rules to get bigger advances. There's also little incentive to do thorough due diligence.

>“You can look at who they are lending to and see it’s not because they’re doing a good job screening for bank quality,” said Kathryn Judge, a Columbia Law School professor who focuses on financial regulation. “It’s a byproduct of the fact there’s a mechanism in place to protect their interests.”

>Two people who worked in different FHLBs for more than a decade said they never saw a loan turned down, no matter how poor the financial health of an institution. What matters, they said, is getting collateral — US Treasuries, home loans, mortgage-backed securities and other real estate assets.

> **Though banks often have to pledge more collateral than they borrow, they have found ways to maximize the value of that collateral. Normally, firms label assets they intend to hold short term as “available for sale.” If the value of those assets fall in the market, the bank marks them down on its books and takes an immediate hit to its earnings. **

> **But firms may avoid markdowns by moving assets to a longer-term accounting bucket dubbed “held-to-maturity.” That allows them to preserve the value of collateral they present when borrowing from an FHLB.**

> **Charles Schwab Corp.’s banking arm shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities to that category last year. The firm borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report. In the first quarter of 2023, its FHLB loans more than tripled.**

>The FHLBs don’t track how banks use their financing. The lifelines can help troubled banks avoid fire sales of assets. But if a firm’s balance sheet is in bad shape, collateralized lending may do little more than postpone the bank’s inevitable demise, potentially letting losses worsen. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is left to clean up the mess.

>“That delay makes a difference,” said Judge, the law professor. “Fresh liquidity allows them to limp on longer rather than evaluate their own viability.”

>After the Fed embarked on a rapid series of rate hikes early last year, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic watched their assets lose value and their financial condition worsen until depositors panicked and FHLB lifelines were no longer enough. The FDIC estimates their failures will cost its main insurance fund more than $31 billion, including coverage of uninsured deposits that will be paid by a special assessment on the industry.

>Meanwhile, the FHLBs and their lobbying arm boast that they’ve never had a loss on a loan in more than eight decades.

>Large banks borrow from many sources, sometimes including more than one FHLB, putting the regional hubs under pressure to compete for business. A former official described how one of the nation’s four giant commercial banks played regional FHLBs off of each other, scoring better rates and terms.

>Earlier this year, the FHLB of Chicago announced a sweetener for its members: “Early bird discounts.”

>Through May 31, the FHLB promised better rates for loans given before 10 a.m. Banks could also get “volume discounts” if they took out advances larger than $100 million, according to its website.

>Such gamesmanship irks policy advocates such as Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “No banks should be able to arbitrage the FHLBs against each other,” he said. “Members should only be allowed one.”

>Chicago FHLB’s Ericson said that enticing members to come in the morning helps with planning and that it’s increasingly common for banks to borrow from just one FHLB.

>Last year, the FHLB’s overseer — the Federal Housing Finance Agency — announced it would conduct a sweeping review of the system to consider whether it needs to be dramatically reshaped. The agency’s director, Sandra Thompson, later signaled dissatisfaction: “The status quo is not acceptable,” she said at a Brookings symposium in February.

>But in the wake of March’s regional banking blowup, Biden administration regulators have been emphasizing the importance of FHLBs in stabilizing the industry’s balance sheets. “Through this period of market stress, the FHLBanks remained in a safe and sound condition and continued to serve their critical role,” Thompson told a congressional panel in May.

>Her agency’s recommendations are expected later this year.

>Some FHLBs are starting to voluntarily pay 50% more than required to housing affordability, and others are in the process of doing so, Donovan wrote to Thompson in March. That would raise their contribution to 15% of their profits.

>Meanwhile, there’s a measure for consideration in Congress that would boost it to 20%. Housing advocates say that’s not enough, arguing that improving affordability should be a more central part of the business model than carving off a slice.

>That wouldn’t include offering better financing terms to Community Development Financial Institutions, which fill gaps in lending to communities, such as minorities or people with low incomes or living in rural areas. The organizations often have to put up more collateral than banks and have a harder time accessing funding even though they more directly address affordability.

>The FHLBs now have around 6,800 members. About 1% are CDFIs. At the same time, more than 500 insurers, including giants like MetLife Inc. that no longer play a pivotal role in housing, are some of the system’s biggest borrowers. On its website, investment firm Wellington Management urges insurers to burnish their profits by drawing even more FHLB money for leverage.

>“You can be outraged but the outrage is in their purpose,” said Morrison, the former Federal Housing Finance Board chair. “The question is whether we really need this huge trillion-dollar institution or if they should be restyled. They serve a private purpose with public subsidy.”",2023-06-05 15:13:34,2024-02-25 22:33:05.976597,265 days 07:19:31.976598,128,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/141hq4s/a_15_trillion_backstop_for_homebuyers_props_up/

iogzhp,investing,Disney will be WAY stronger post-covid,"Disney releases D+ just in time for the pandemic and is now highly competitive with Netflix which has 182.8 million subscribers globally compared with 104.5 million for Disney as of Q2 earnings report (including Hulu and ESPN, both of which Disney owns) without even launching in all international markets yet and launching Hulu in Europe next year.

This weekend alone, D+ downloads rose +68% due to Mulan. Most importantly, with D+ launch access to Mulan at $30, they have complete ownership of all sales instead of sharing it with movie theaters. Consumer spending inside the D+ app spiked 193% this weekend. Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mulan-disney-plus-downloads-68-percent-weekend-194701349.html

But the key thing to my thinking is that while Disney’s stock has performed relatively well during the pandemic due to D+, post-lockdown they have pent-up demand for their parks, cruises, and theatrical releases too. They are a lockdown play, a post-lockdown play, and a vaccine play. At every moment, they have a winning play and are highly differentiated with every competitor. The sum is worth a lot more than the parts. Thoughts?

Robinhood day traders swarmed to Eastman Kodak Co. shares as the stock rallied 1,600% this week.

As of 11 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, 43,000 users of the investing app had added [Kodak](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KODK:US) to their accounts in some form over the past 24 hours, according to website Robintrack.net, which aggregates data from the brokerage but isn’t affiliated with it. The activity was 20 times more than the next most-popular stock, Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roughly 27,000 of the additions came over a four-hour span earlier Wednesday.

 

The growing presence of retail investors has become a popular markets narrative this year with zero commission fees and the potential for entertainment in a world largely without sports or gambling luring a new crop of traders. The impact they have on prices is unclear, but similar buying sprees have erupted in pockets of the equity market, including electric-vehicle firms, shares of companies in bankruptcy protection and increasingly pharmaceutical stocks.

* Yellen says that technologies in **terrorist financing** change over time, and response also needs to change with it. She noted crypotcurrency as an area of concern for terrorist and criminal financing.
* “I believe the future is likely to bring **low interest rates for a long time**,” she said, adding it is possible for rates to rise.
* “I think we should take these risks very,very seriously. I think **climate change is an existential threat**.”
* “I would be very pleased to take a look” at **issuing longer-term debt**, including a **50-year Treasury bond**, she says.
* **Yellen goes on the offensive here over the question of the minimum wage**, saying the latest research shows only “minimal” job losses in states that raised their minimum wage levels.
*  Grassley said he’s “closely examining” Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. He says the plan doesn’t appear to be well targeted and says it’s **important to “focus efforts” on pandemic relief and not enact a “laundry list” of liberal reforms.**
* This appears to be a stab at the plans inclusion of a $15 federal minimum wage in the plan.
* She says there would be money for small business, grants to small entrepreneurs, eviction protections, nutrition assistance, paid leave -- all things to help minority communities.
* To **not spend more on pandemic and economic relief would leave the economy worse off**, she said. She said without deficit financing this aid, the economy could have long run problems and “scarring.”
* She says she is concerned that China is investing in electric vehicles and that most of the EV sales are projected to be in China in the coming years.
* Yellen says that they would not seek to roll back the 2017 tax cuts “now” while the economy is still struggling.
* Yellen says **the value of the dollar should be determined by markets, and the U.S. does not seek a weaker currency to gain a competitive advantage.**
*  Some hedge funds have “dangerous levels of leverage,” Yellen says.

PayPal Holdings Inc. is exploring acquisitions of cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin custodian BitGo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would expand its embrace of digital coins.

PayPal has been holding talks with BitGo, a company that helps investors store Bitcoin securely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets, the people added.

It couldn’t be learned how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised $58.5 million in 2018 at a $170 million valuation, according to PitchBook.

Representatives for BitGo and PayPal declined to comment.

Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was founded in 2013 by Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe. It offers digital wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions, as well as offline vaults for storing Bitcoin and rival currencies. It was one of the first companies in the space to focus on institutional investors, according to its website.

The company applied in August to New York regulators to become an independent, regulated qualified custodian under New York State Banking Law, a press release showed. Custodians like BitCoin are responsible for safekeeping digital assets using secure storage.

PayPal announced on Wednesday that its customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. The announcement led Bitcoin to surge past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.

PayPal said it would partner with BitGo competitor Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services for its new service.

BitGo is backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Craft Ventures, Digital Currency Group, DRW, Galaxy Digital Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund.",2020-10-23 10:39:39,2024-02-25 22:33:05.976805,1220 days 11:53:26.976805,275,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jgkp92/paypal_in_talks_to_buy_crypto_firms_including/
g0uf45,investing,"Market Analysis: Focusing on what is ""baked into"" the future with high probability","Hi All,

Like many other investors, I rapidly became overwhelmed with the uncertainty in the future. Consequently I decided to focus in on what we know now with high probability. Essentially this is assuming all fiscal / monetary policies as currently enacted and consensus estimates on COVID-19 mitigation (i.e. gradual resumption of normal commerce after mid to late Q2). See more detailed assumptions later. 

&nbsp;


Some facts going into the analysis:

* 2019 saw a ~30% gain in the S&P 500, however corporate earnings were nearly flat. Consequently, the 30% rise in the S&P 500 was due almost entirely to increases in valuation, i.e. stock investors paying more for future earnings
* The OECD had projected in September 2019 3.0% Global GDP growth and 2.0% for the US. This was already a deceleration of global growth from 3.6% worldwide in 2018 and 2.9% in the US.
* US Manufacturing, according to the ISM and IHS Markit surveys, weakened through most of 2019 (although showed a slight rebound near the end of year)
* US Business investment also declined through much of 2019, potentially due to the ""trade war"" between the China & the US
* US Consumer spending remained robust throughout 2019, although also appeared to decelerate near the end of 2019 / early 2020. 
* US households had modestly de-leveraged as a % of GDP since 2008, and the debt servicing costs (due to lower interest rates) were at historic lows at the end of 2019. It’s worth noting the changing composition of household debt, with strong increases in student loan and auto debt while mortgage debt decreased. Housing debt peaked at ~$10 trillion in 2008, compared to slightly less than ~$10 trillion at the end of 2019. However, non-housing debt peaked at ~$2.7 trillion in 2008, while by 2019 non-housing debt stood at $4.2 trillion
* US Corporate debt stood at record levels as compared to GDP: ~75%. This debt had also deteriorated in ratings with the largest percentage in history rated as slightly above junk (BBB)
* The US deficit for fiscal year 2019 was estimated at ~$1 trillion pre-COVID
* The bulk of net inflows from 2016-2019 into US equities have been driven by stock buybacks. Since 2009, companies have spent ~$5 trillion in share buybacks

&nbsp;


In short, my analysis is that the US economy entered 2020 with modest to low growth prospects. While consumer spending and household debt servicing costs remained bright spots, modest wage gains coupled with high housing, education, and healthcare costs presented a mixed picture. Both business investment and manufacturing activity were subdued, although hopes for a ""Phase 1"" trade war seemed cause for modest optimism. 

&nbsp;

With those facts as background, here are my baked in assumptions for the following analysis:

* The OECD nations + major developing countries (China, etc.) modestly resume normal economic activity in mid to late Q2

* There is no vaccine or ""miracle drug"" until late 2020 / 2021
* Stimulus from major central banks globally prevents an immediate financial crisis or severe market distortions (e.g. the corporate credit market seizing up)
* Additional fiscal stimulus measures, while substantial, do not exceed the original stimulus bills (e.g. the $2.2 trillion US bill)
* The COVID-19 lockdown contributes to a severe recession in Q1/Q2 2020 in most countries, but the easing of lockdown measures + stimulus leads to modest to substantial recovery in Q3 2020. 

&nbsp;


Alright, onto the main event. Here is what I think is ""baked"" into the future assuming the above events:

* Dramatic increases in sovereign debt levels. The US alone is estimated to run a deficit of ~$3-4 trillion depending on the severity and duration of the recession. With global debt levels already at records highs, it is unclear what effect these substantial debt levels will have (deflation, inflation, stagflation, no effect?) 

* Severe budget deficits in US state & local governments. Increased spending on unemployment insurance and healthcare expenditures coupled with decreased revenues will force states to significantly cut their budgets. These cuts will include layoffs of non-essential employees. 
* Increased pressure on Euro zone economies, particularly Italy. Italian economic growth remained anemic in 2019 at 0.3%. With the complete lockdown of the Italian economy (which began in the economic engine of Northern Italy), Italy will likely face dramatic declines in GDP and correspondingly large government deficits. Northern Eurozone countries will be faced yet again with difficult choices with regards to Italian debt. Pressure from northern Eurozone countries on Italy risk furthering inflaming public opinion and leading to a separatist backlash. 
* Negative to zero growth in US consumer spending in 2020. Despite the enhanced unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and corporate / small biz loans I believe it is unlikely that consumer spending will rebound in 2020. Consumers will prioritize on paying off debts, rebuilding savings, etc. due to the economic uncertainty. Furthermore there is permanent demand destruction in certain sectors, e.g. consumers are unlikely to replace all of their canceled vacations, restaurant visits, shopping excursions, etc. The ""wealth effect"" will work in reverse as many high income households see drops in both their investments accounts as well as variable compensation: bonuses, pay raises, RSUs, stock options, etc. 
* Unemployment will remain substantially elevated over its early 2020 low of ~3.5% through 2020. As in 2009, many corporations will ""do more with less"" in lieu of hiring during uncertain times. Small and medium sized businesses will face substantial revenue losses in 2020 and will focus on cutting costs to remain solvent. 
* Manufacturing and business investment will remain weak in 2020. Manufacturing will continue to stagnant due to sluggish demand for automobiles, aircraft, and other durable goods. Businesses will focus on preserving cash, paying down / refinancing debts, etc. due to weak global demand
* The US Federal Reserve will continue to support markets with QE and other monetary policy measures. 
* Increased likelihood of a change in US presidential administrations. In early 2020 the Democratic party appeared poised to nominate a progressive, divisive candidate in Bernie Sanders. By April 2020 Joe Biden, a center-left candidate, had secured the nomination. At the same time, the US economic outlook had substantially deteriorated. While the economy is likely to improve in the June-November timeline, it is unclear if this recovery will be substantial enough to allow President Trump to run on a message of economic recovery. The increased likelihood of a Democratic presidential administration is a corresponding decreased likelihood of further US corporate tax cuts.
* Dramatic decrease in stock buybacks in 2020. Companies will focus on preserving cash and reducing debt levels. 
* Significant deployment of ""dry powder"" from cash rich corporates and private equity firms (which have ~$2+ trillion in unallocated funds). These funds will look for opportunities in distressed credit, M&A, and other opportunistic areas
* Continued low oil prices in 2020. While a modest recovery is possible, the magnitude of demand destruction for oil, the unraveling of Opec+, and the continuing impact of American shale drillers will contain price growth. 
* Continued China - US tension. There is little sign of a thaw in relations, and a hard line against China is one of the few popular bi-partisan issues in US domestic politics. Initial discussions to suspend Chinese tariffs during the crisis seem to have stalled.
* Emphasis on supply chain resiliency / diversification. Between the US - China trade war and the COVID-19 outbreak, OECD companies will face both investor and political pressure to diversify their supply chain away from China. This will bolster the slow and gradual shift that was already underway due to increasing Chinese labor costs and the perception of an opaque, unfair legal regime. In the short term this will drive up costs (China is a manufacturing hub for many reasons beyond cheap labor) which will either compress corporate profits or raise consumer prices.  
* Unlike 2009, there does not appear to be a new global engine of growth. China seems justifiably concerned about exacerbating their debt situation with massive fiscal stimulus. India was already experiencing a recession, and other major economies like Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. do not have the per capita purchasing power to stimulate global growth. Many of these countries are also suffering from the collapse in commodity prices and the flight from emerging market bonds / equities. 

&nbsp;


I hesitate to forecast the future, because obviously there is significant uncertainty. However, my personal base case is that an immediate ""V-shaped"" recovery in asset prices is unlikely. For asset prices to reach or exceed 2020 levels would require corporates to either substantially increase earnings in mid to late 2020 AND investors to value future earnings at the same high levels of 2020. However, it is worth noting that the record low interest rates (and corresponding bond yields) and monetary easing could in theory drive investors into equities, real estates, private equity, etc. as the only option for positive returns. My personal base case is a sluggish recovery in mid to late 2020 with asset prices remaining volatile to shifts in sentiment. With the Fed stabilizing markets, a widespread global depression seems unlikely but could occur if high global debt levels trigger widespread corporate bankruptcies or some form of ""stagflation"". Another unlikely, but possible case is that the world emulates Japan after the early 1990s and experiences a long period of slow asset price decline as corporates deleverage, credit availability declines modestly, and no new global engines of growth emerge. 

&nbsp;


Thoughts?

&nbsp;


Edit #2: Adding in how to know I'm wrong


One thing that occurred to me is that since this analysis is slightly bearish, I should proactively offer some data points that would indicate I'm wrong / overly pessimistic:

* Rapid recovery in US consumer spending in Q3 / Q4 2020 to pre-COVID levels
* Rapid return to pre-COVID employment, ~3.5%, by Q4 2020 
* Increased US business investment / manufacturing activity in Q3 / Q4 to supplement or replace consumer spending
* The rapid return of the US corporate debt market which enables large stock buybacks in Q4 2020 onward
* Corporate earnings growth compared to late 2019 (i.e. not simply quarter on quarter comparisons against the likely awful Q1 / Q2 numbers)
* Massive US government infrastructure projects / other stimulus programs that generate demand and boost US household incomes 

Edit #3: Some people have correctly pointed out that India was not in a recession in 2019. Apologies, I should have said that growth had decelerated over 2019, with Q4 2019 growth estimated at ~4.7% compared to GDP of ~7% in 2018. I think my larger point stands that India's economy did not appear to be trending in a positive direction, and given their per capita income of ~$1700 4.7% is not sufficient to dramatically improve global growth.

mq3sz8,investing,Guide to bitcoin mining stocks,"With Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html).

gcc06x,investing,1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments going into the COVID-19 crises.,"I think a big assumption in the V-shaped recovery theory is that the U.S. economy was relatively healthy going into the crises. And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. 

This idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: 

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. 
* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.

I find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media.

Stagflation = high unemployment + high inflation 

We had this in the 70’s; in this scenario if rates go up, debts get more expense and layoffs happen. Therefore unemployment goes *up*.

If rates go down and we do QE, inflation goes *up*.

If we do nothing, then inflation gets worse as it’s self re-enforcing, and unemployment gets higher as people consume less due to rising inflation and that means companies make less money leading to more layoffs…

How did the 1970’s get out of this pickle???

> **""I'm not happy with the Fed because I think they're following not leading, and we should be leading,"" the president said during a news conference to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak and the ongoing U.S. response.**

> **Since the disease's spread has intensified, the U.S. central bank has enacted an emergency interest rate of 50 basis points, opened up a liquidity program to the bank to add up to $1.5 trillion to the financial system and started buying government debt across the yield curve.**

> Trump said he is not yet looking at removing Jerome Powell as chairman, though he believes he has the right to do so. He has harshly criticized Powell previously, saying the Fed should be more aggressive in easing the stance of monetary policy.

> **""I have the right to remove him. No, I'm not doing that,"" Trump said. ""I also have the right to put him in a regular position and put someone else in charge, and I haven't made any decisions on that.""**

> Trump likely could move Powell out as chairman. Powell's term as governor runs until 2026; Trump would need cause to remove him from that position.

> The Fed has little room left to cut rates after the intermeeting reduction nearly two weeks ago. Its policy rate is now in a targeted range between 1%-1.25%. Market pricing points to the Federal Open Market Committee taking the rate to near-zero, where it was during and after the financial crisis.

> As he has in the past, Trump pointed to other central banks in Europe and Japan that have policy rates less than the Fed's. The president said that in some cases it is ""two points,"" which is not accurate. 

> He also insisted that the U.S. could ""refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate.""

k0qn1k,investing,"Uber, Lyft, Doordash Can Pay Gig Workers Up To 15% Compensation in Stock Under New SEC proposal","&#x200B;

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",2020-11-25 11:37:00,2024-02-25 22:33:05.976883,1187 days 10:56:05.976883,335,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k0qn1k/uber_lyft_doordash_can_pay_gig_workers_up_to_15/

n9zazb,investing,Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status,"* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the first time deficits have topped that mark since 2012

WASHINGTON—The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the Treasury Department said Thursday, the first time year-to-date deficits have topped that amount in seven years.

Higher spending on the military, rising interest expenses on government debt and weak revenues early in the fiscal year combined to push the deficit up 19% from October through August, compared with the same period a year earlier. Government spending climbed 7%, to $4.1 trillion, outpacing higher federal tax receipts, which grew 3%, to $3.1 trillion.

That brought the total deficit to $1.07 trillion so far in fiscal 2019, which started Oct. 1, or 4.4% as a share of gross domestic product.

The last time the U.S. recorded a budget gap of that magnitude in the first 11 months of the fiscal year was in August 2012, when the deficit totaled $1.16 trillion, a period when the U.S. was still climbing out of a deep recession. Deficits began to decline soon after amid concerns about rising red ink, after Republicans and Democrats agreed to cut spending and let certain tax cuts expire.

No such agreement is on the horizon now, and forecasters project trillion-dollar annual deficits for decades to come.

A strong economy typically leads to narrower deficits, as rising household income and corporate profits help boost tax collections, while spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance tends to decline.

The U.S. economy has been growing for 10 years as of July, the longest economic expansion on record. Yet annual U.S. deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion starting this year, due in part to the 2017 tax law, which constrained federal revenue collection last year, and a 2018 budget deal that busted spending caps enacted in 2011.

Senior Treasury officials attributed this year’s higher deficit primarily to a surge in government spending, and emphasized that federal revenues have climbed nearly 7% since May, in large part reflecting a robust economy and low unemployment. Corporate tax revenue in particular has rebounded in recent months, after a period when analysts were unsure why it was running below Congressional Budget Office projections.

Still, revenue growth has continued to lag the broader economy, and is below where forecasters projected it would be prior to the 2017 tax cuts.

Federal spending has continued to climb. The Treasury said Thursday spending on the military and interest costs on government debt each rose 9% from October through August, and Medicare expenses increased 10%.

It’s not yet clear whether the deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the full fiscal year, because the government usually collects more revenue in September than it spends, which could bring the overall figure down. The White House Office of Management and Budget in July projected the deficit would hit $1 trillion by the end of September, while the CBO last month said it expected a total deficit of $960 billion in fiscal 2019.

Rising deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government said it expected to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019. Government debt held by the public has risen from $14.4 trillion at the start of the Trump administration, to nearly $17 trillion today, a 19% increase.

President Trump and Congress have reached a spending deal that avoids a crisis on the debt ceiling but adds significantly to the federal budget deficit. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the new agreement may focus attention on runaway government spending. Photo: AP (Originally published July 24, 2019)
Markets have responded to the increased issuance with a shrug, and interest rates remain at historic lows amid steady demand from investors. Still, a swelling debt load has increased the government’s debt-servicing costs, one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the government was considering financing options that could reduce borrowing costs, including introducing a 50-year bond and lengthening the maturity of Treasury borrowing.

President Trump, as part of his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve policy makers, argued on Wednesday that further short-term rate cuts would also help lower government borrowing costs.

Reacting on Twitter to a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said of European governments: “They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!”

Some economists are skeptical that pushing interest rates to zero, as he called for, would lead to lower interest costs on government debt.

More broadly, annual deficits are projected to more than double as a share of the economy over the coming decades, as a wave of retiring baby boomers pushes up federal spending on retirement and health-care benefits.

CBO last month increased its expectations for deficits over the next decade after Congress and the White House reached a new two-year budget deal that would boost federal spending more than $300 billion above spending caps enacted in 2011.

The deal will add roughly $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2020 and 2029, assuming federal spending continues to rise by the rate of inflation beyond 2021.

Inspired by Mr_Suzan and galloog1.","In October of 2018, /u/Mr_Suzan was inspired by a post from /u/galloog1 to seek out underrated stock picks from the /r/investing community and monitor their performance.  


Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?  

&nbsp;

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

izw2gt,investing,Short sellers are GOOD for the Market,"Shortsellers are going after our favorite stocks to profit therefore we should despise them right? But are they all really bad? 

Don’t just read articles and blog posts that confirm your view about a company. ***Right  now a lot of $TSLA & $NKLA shareholders are mad about shortsellers  going after their stock but in fact you should embrace it.***

Shortsellers do research that you could ***never do on your own***.  In fact I would love it if someone would give me a 50 page report on  everything thats wrong with any of my holdings. I know whats right about  all the companies I own. What I want to know are the flaws, the  accounting issues ( if there are any ) etc.

With Luckin Coffee Muddy Waters Research bought thousands of cups of  coffee from different branches and kept an eye on the customers. Thats  invaluable research and in the end they were right that the numbers  don’t match up. 

They probably saved a lot of Luckin Coffee Shareholders from bigger  losses ( those who read the report). And of course short sellers should  get compensated for this work. There have to be incentives to do this  kind of work. Else nobody would do it. Don’t count on auditors which are  incentivized to look the other way and keep a paying client.When you’re  an analyst you can just say you think revenue will go up but you don’t  need to back it up. 

Thats it. But when you accuse someone of fraud then you better have a  lot of evidence to support this view. Short sellers face potential  losses & lawsuit. If they are wrong they lose a lot. Thats why they  work hard and only release reports when they have enough to back up  their claim. Also what do Companies like Nikola have to worry about ? If  everything is fine then the Hindenburg report will turn out false and  they continue to enjoy a rising share price. **But what if the report is right?**

If you are a Nikola shareholder then you should pay attention to it.  Read it and work this into your thesis for owning the stock. Is it worth  the risk? Maybe limit your exposure.But don’t ridicule the people that  release those reports. There is a lot of hard work & money behind  it.

***Short sellers don’t do this for the fun of it.***  And if they are right they should be compensated for their work. I  would actually say that many short sellers work much harder on research  than a long analyst. After all they have to be right to make money. If  they’re wrong they won’t be able to enjoy market returns. They would  literally get wiped out.

14m93i9,investing,Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he’s written an annual letter showing us how he did it.,"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.  
Just because a company does well short term doesn’t mean it’s sustainable.  
“When the tide goes out, you’ll see who’s been swimming naked.”  
This isn't just investors.  
It's businesses too.",2023-06-29 16:13:25,2024-02-25 22:33:05.976964,241 days 06:19:40.976967,369,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14m93i9/warren_buffett_built_a_107_billion_net_worth/

I am 28 and ive helped my mom countless times to pay rent or loan her small amounts up to 300 dollars of money at a time.( she pays it back).

Well she is going to inherit at least 4 million from her uncle once he passes(he is 97). And Ive told her to let me help her manage it because she has no clue what she is doing with money. But i do not know what to do with that amount of money as well. She doesnt have her paperwork in order or a plan to collect this once he passes. He is very very frugal with money and i dont want to offend him by asking what the plan is once hes gone to help my mom. But my mom has no clue she says she “has the paperwork somewhere” i dont know where to start. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Im not looking to take advantage of my mom (many will want to) and shes a giving person. i want her to keep it until shes gone too. I just want to help her so she doesnt blow it or loses half of it to the government.

UPDATE: thanks for all the responses i am reading through them I’ll get back to you guys. Just some added info, my mom is poor she lives off social security and barely. Also she wants to buy a house she is in a senior living apartment atm, which idk if she should and she will need a care taker when she does.

13eh4ot,investing,"Disney+ Sheds 4 Million Subscribers in Second Straight Quarterly Drop, Streaming Losses Narrow by 26%","From [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/disney-plus-subscribers-q2-earnings-1235607524/):

Primary takeaways -

* Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in Q2 2023, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop.
* However, the company narrowed its streaming business losses by $400 million YoY.
* The sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia.
* In the US/Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subscribers while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.
* Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.
* Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”
* Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”
* Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Products group saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion.
* The company's Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion.
* Disney's content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.
* Disney+ shed another 4 million subscribers in the first three months of 2023, marking the streamer’s second consecutive quarterly drop after closing 2022 with its first-ever decline. On the bright side, the Mouse House also managed to narrow its streaming business losses by $400 million, down 26% year over year.

On Wednesday, CEO Bob Iger and Co. beat Wall Street estimates for Disney’s quarterly earnings and revenue due to an impressive January-March showing at the company’s theme parks. That win comes during a fiscal Q2, which concluded April 1, plagued by company-wide layoffs, a looming (and now active) writers strike and a turf war with Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis.

Disney ended the quarter with 157.8 million subscribers at Disney+, significantly missing Wall Street’s estimate of 163.17 million subs. That projected figured would have been up from the 161.8 million subs Disney+ fell to the prior quarter.

This second sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, Disney lost streaming rights to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches, which prompted it to lower growth targets for Disney+ Hotstar in India.

In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subs (to reach 46.3 million), while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.

Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.

During Disney’s earnings call with analysts later Wednesday, Iger — who returned to his post as CEO last fall upon the ousting of Bob Chapek — announced that Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”

Also on the call, CFO Christine McCarthy announced Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”

According to McCarthy, Disney expects a writedown in Q3 of $1.5-$1.8 billion from removing the content. McCarthy also said “going forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.”

The content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.

Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents on $21.78 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Disney reported adjusted EPS of 93 cents on $21.82 billion in revenue.

Disney posted negative free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter.

Starting with its fiscal Q2 2022, Disney restructured its financial results into two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion — which was better than analysts forecasted.

At Disney’s linear TV networks, revenue dropped 7% to $6.6 billion, and operating income decreased 35% to $1.8 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s domestic TV channels business, which include ABC and ESPN, decreased 4% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 33% to $1.6 billion. The drop in operating income was attributable to lower ad revenue and higher sports programming and production costs.

International channels’ revenue for the quarter dropped 18% to $1.1 billion and operating income fell 65% to $85 million.

The brightest spot for Disney in the quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products group, which saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion, reflecting increased guest spending at international and domestic parks and experiences (primarily at Disney’s international parks and resorts).

Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues, which includes box office revenue, increased 18% to $2.2 billion and saw an operating loss of of $50 million, down from an increase of $16 million year over year.

Per Disney, “the improvement at theatrical distribution was due to the continued success of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which was released in the first quarter of the current year, partially offset by the comparison to co-production income in the prior-year quarter from Marvel’s ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home.’ The current quarter included the release of ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ whereas the prior-year quarter included the release of ‘Death on the Nile.'”

Disney stock closed Wednesday at $101.14 per share.

Looking at today's stock market bump, I'm wondering if investors are still dreaming of the next big rally, and ignoring all the issues that will result from turning off the taps after a 14 year low interest bender.

In the UK, for just one example, retirees in life cycle funds find [they have 20% ~~left~~ less to retire on](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/11/pensions-retiring-losses-ftse-aviva-value) because of the fall in bonds.

The decline of the SP500 from 4800 to 3900, plus another 10% inflation, represents a net loss of about 30% in accumulated perceived stock wealth.    Perceived wealth helps drive spending, which drives profitability.

House prices haven't fallen (yet), not even much in real dollars,  but the monthly payment on a $500K mortgage  has gone from to $2100 to $3300 ($3000 in real dollars).      I can't imagine what this means for new housing starts.

And bonds to support local improvements have gone up, as have corporate bonds, which drive profits with cheap lending, and government spending will be hitting constraints of higher past and current borrowing costs.

I don't think any of this has fully sunk in, seeing the itchy trigger fingers on the markets.

tl;dr: TIPS paying 1.5% over inflation might be the best thing going, particularly if one can avoid tax.

Highlights from the article:

> [SVB's] mistake was a bad — and ultimately lethal — one. But it wasn’t wholly unique. ... U.S. banks were sitting on $620 billion in unrealized losses from securities that had dropped in price at the end of 2022 ... Adding in other potential losses, including on mortgages that were extended when rates were low, economists at New York University have estimated that the total may be more like $1.75 trillion. Banks can offset that with higher earnings on deposits — but that doesn’t work if depositors pull their money out 

> The Fed unveiled an emergency loan program on Sunday night that will offer banks cash in exchange for their bonds ... But even if the Fed succeeds at neutralizing the threat of bank runs tied to rising rates, it is likely that other vulnerabilities grew during decades of relatively low interest rates.


> There’s an old saying: Whenever the Fed hits the brakes, someone goes through the windshield,” said Michael Feroli, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. “

> A jump in rates has been blamed for helping to burst the bubble in technology stocks in the early 2000s, and for contributing to the decline in house prices that helped to set off the crash in 2008.

> Investors have pulled back from tech company stocks, which tend to have values that are predicated on expectations for growth.  [which] has quickly translated into a souring job market in technology. 

> “This just teaches you that we really have these blind spots,” said Jeremy Stein, a former Fed governor who is now at Harvard. “You put more pressure on the pipes, and something is going to crack — but you never know where it is going to be.”

There's a community for you to discuss which toaster has the nicest shell and to tell you you're not a weirdo.

* It's not your fault, you didn't make a bad investment.
* Shadowy figures are conspiring to bring your investment down, it's not your fault.
* This investment will make us rich (soon!). 

Any doubt is downvoted to oblivion.

People who say anything bearish are banned. If you decide to sell your shares after something like bankruptcy is announced, you'll be shunned.

1awpej3,investing,After the Bell: Nvidia clobbers earnings expectations as AI demand hits ‘tipping point’; stock up 6%,"I haven’t seen this posted yet. So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.

I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble.

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit.
