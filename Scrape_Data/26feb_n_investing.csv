1b0rrz0,investing,How to use Financial Ratio,"Financial Ratios help a whole lot when looking at the health and strength of a business. But I still don’t know how to tell if a business is actually health after doing the math and getting the percentages. Do you tell its health by comparing to other companies within same industry? Or by comparing to last year fiscal year’s ratios? Or there a certain indicator or standard that says if percentage is above 20% it’s indicates a very healthy business?

I’m probably overthinking it.

1b0qttn,investing,Backtesting 25 years of leveraged ETFs with Moving Averages,"[Screenshot of results](https://i.imgur.com/3Vxh7XD.png)

Hi, I want to share how anyone can easily backtest LETFs up to 1999 on PortfolioVisualizer. The reason is I haven't seen this method posted anywhere, my assumption is most are unaware of other tickers besides the classic UPRO or TQQQ.

Normally, the standard way is to create your own sim data which you import to PV. Pros: you can go back a lot further. Cons: prone to error if lacking knowledge, it requires a subscription plan, unable to publicly share their PV link (as we will do below).

The inception dates for the most popular LETFs are \~2010 for 3x (UPRO, TQQQ) and 2006 for 2x (SSO, QLD). We can accurately ""extend"" them by using these funds with inception date 1999:

* **ULPIX: 2x S&P 500**
* **UOPIX: 2x Nasdaq-100**

Then to simulate their 3x counterpart we apply 1.5x Leverage on them. We can check for consistency comparing them to UPRO and TQQQ, metrics should be close to identical:

* [UPRO vs 1.5x ULPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=e9Ww2XytVpITO3aDg6Q22)
* [TQQQ vs 1.5 UOPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=2tyAOeTrDXjMNI59YEVWg9)

Now all the PV links for the data I extracted in the screenshot (Buy & Hold vs MA):

* [S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6hdJviUxLkTKjsjY0X59gR)
* [2x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=1VzljcRe9xxCBcrh7VFhVQ)
* [3x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=5rGWFUe9SGd5gN2Huz2PN6)
* [Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6I1EZMO0waRp5YOCtxKeDr)
* [2x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=7GsHtE6iQHRfXS97sOxCeR)
* [3x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=OGx3xyCH9eMOMtFWSvNyI)

My belief is 1999 is actually a great time to start backtesting LETFs as a minimum timeframe since we capture the 3 highest stress periods in the modern era (dotcom, subprime, pandemic) and as shown this can be easily achieved on PV by everyone.

Also 1999 proved quite terrible timing to lump sum into a LETF but I think this adds value to the analysis, as it emphasizes the catastrophic effect of drawdowns and hopefully tames the euphoria usually carried around LETF gains. They absolutely require a hedge to strive in the long-run regardless if lumpsum or DCA.

Which brings me to the last point - a way to mitigate this is by trading around a long Moving Average, which is why I included the strategy in the analysis. Not much to say here, this topic is already thoroughly discussed and backtested, worth checking:

* [Trend Following In Financial Markets](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/01/movingaverage/)
* [Leveraged SMA200 Strategy Back-tested 1929-2019](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=297591)
* [Leverage for the Long Run](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)
* [Using S&P 200-day moving average as volatility forecaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LETFs/comments/mfugvt/trading_letfs_upro_tqqq_etc_using_sp_200day/)

Only a few comments from my side regarding MA:

* Use the S&P 500 as signal even if you trade leveraged Nasdaq-100, the former is broader and a better market volatility indicator. Never trade based on the LETF crossovers, that is a costly mistake.
* Always trade at signal. Some use monthly due to superior results in certain backtests but those rely on timing luck, e.g. for the Covid crash you just so happened to go under the MA in the last days of February exactly when making the monthly trade, had this occurred a couple of days later March would have crushed your leveraged portfolio until your next monthly trade (>50% loss in UPRO)
* Most of the MA trades are unprofitable short-term whipsaws, this can be painful but normal and expected. It's the cost needed to make the strategy perform, a minority of highly profitable trades entirely make up for it and place you well ahead of a Buy & Hold on all risk metrics.
* You will notice I used the 12-months SMA (252 days). Also discussed in the above links, S&P 500 backtests since 1929 show nearly identical results on all metrics between 200<->250 SMA, so just use \~250 because this improves on the number of signals and whipsaws. For example in the period I backtested above there are 143 trades, if we change the Lookback Period to 9 months (189 days) we get 201 trades, an unnecessary 40% increase (this can be checked under ""Model Trades"" in my PV links)
* I also wrote a simple TradingView script to illustrate every 250-day signal, just add it on your SPX chart: [](https://www.tradingview.com/script/AQI5dBa2-Moving-Average-250-day-Strategy/AQI5dBa2)

But of course I started to overthink the whole situation. 

Option 1: pay off car as fast as reasonably possible, maybe buy it outright. This would prevent me from paying interest.

Option 2: try to lock in a low rate, pay over a long period of time, and hope inflation works in my favor. Invest any extra money I'd use to pay it off.

There may not be enough info to figure this out, I have great credit but I'm not sure what rates I'd be looking at.

1b0npoz,investing,Is healthcare the best long-term investing ?,"Here is my theory:

  
1. **Life expectancy is up**: More revenue as population gets older.  
2. **AI application** : Cost reduction opportunity through AI as primary care (check \`medprompt\`).  
3. **Technology Advancement**: Automation of high-cost procedures can improve timing and capabilities (endoscopy, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and more).

My only concern on the short term is a series of mass layoffs which will make many people live without insurance, or the US reforming the healthcare system in a way that hurts companies.

Thoughts?

1b0mfd0,investing,Compounding Interest Difference Eventually Stuck At Specific Percent Difference,"Apologies ahead of time as I am not sure if my wording is sufficient and I am also not someone with a finance or math background professionally. I do enjoy investing on the side and like learning about personal finance in general. I found myself trying to compare something someone posted about on IG asking people if they'd prefer getting $6k a week for life or $5 million right now. 

At a certain point of comparison, I tried comparing them to see how it would look if you invested both incomes at 10% YoY with no taxable income/dividends to control for. Strictly just 10% YoY value growth. 

So using [this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.htm), I tried to see how each one would look with this return over the course of various time periods (12.5 years, 25, 50, etc.). I figured at SOME point the $6k a week income would eventually start to return more than the initial one, (even if like hundreds of years into the future haha), because of a combination of compounding and consistent, continuous investments as opposed to a one time lump sum investment. 

So after 12.5 years, the difference between the two scenarios was like 72%. 

At 25 years it was around 32.5%.

At 50 years it was around 21.25%.

I seem to have encountered a conundrum where at around 70 years, the % difference between the first and second scenario becomes about 20.2% and then as I increment the time periods it seems to stay constant. I've tried up to 400 years and it's sitting at 20.2%.

I think my math for calculating the % difference is correct.

(Scenario A - Scenario B) / Scenario B

Is it maybe some limitation with the calculator I am using? If not, what is this phenomenon called? Why is 20.2% the final coefficient (if that's the right terminology). This also leads me to believe in some combination where the two types of contribution types will eventually meet in the middle and then rise evenly from then on?  

Again, apologies if this is something obvious to investment/math professionals that I am unaware of but I couldn't find out too much online or with ChatGPT (could also have to do with my wording) and I am just trying to learn more.",2024-02-26 16:58:01,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497453,0 days 03:31:46.497454,4,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b0mfd0/compounding_interest_difference_eventually_stuck/

Despite reassurances from many friends that Rivian was the future, I bought in at $21. However, I never anticipated losing 50 percent of my investment so rapidly.

I have a question about recent news that directly affects my portfolio. This is a new experience for me, as I've never encountered this type of event before.

&#x200B;

>SAN FRANCISCO - NGM Biopharmaceuticals , Inc. (NASDAQ:NGM), a biotech firm engaged in developing transformative therapeutics, is set to be acquired by Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Neon Parent, Inc. and its affiliate Atlas Neon Merger Sub, Inc., both entities affiliated with The Column Group, LP, NGM Bio's largest shareholder. The all-cash tender offer of $1.55 per share represents an 80% premium over NGM Bio's last closing price before the acquisition interest was disclosed, valuing the company at $135 million on a fully diluted basis.

  
So happened that i'm an owner of some shares of NGM.

1b0h23c,investing,Huge gains for Frontier Developments on the horizon. Thoughts?,"The stock is now worth 125 GBX while their all time high was 3,300 GBX in 2021.

Up untill 2022 the company turned a small profit of 15-20 million GBP per year. However, last year the company had a 20 million loss. As explained by the company management themselves because of an unsuccesful attempt at expanding their portfolio with games like F1 Manager.

From what I’ve seen, that game was a buggy and boring mess and way outside Frontiers zone of competency. Frontier has recently stated they will return to focus on Creative Management Simulations with games like Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo, games which have brought them moderate success in the past.
Coming back to their financial performance; their attempts to broaden their portfolio over the past few years was the reason that their expenses doubled over the past few years but Frontier got little return on that investment. Exactly the reason why the company is in it's current state.

However, with games on the horizon like Planet Zoo for the console I don’t see why this company won’t return to profitability within the next few years? And if they are able to get back to a similar cashflow to the one they had before 2023 I feel like this stock would be way underpriced.

Thoughts?","I recently made a £230,482 return on investment from an investment solution I initiated a few months ago, primarily focusing on trading. While I'm thrilled with the outcome, I'm unsure if it was just luck or if there's a solid strategy at play.

Having invested approximately £100k in stocks, I'm now contemplating diversifying into real estate by acquiring an investment property. With interest rates on the rise, I'm curious about the viability of property investment amidst these conditions.

Specifically, my questions are:

1. Given the current trend of increasing interest rates, what is your perspective on investing in property? Is it a potential disaster waiting to happen?

2. For those who own negatively geared properties, have you opted to increase rent to mitigate losses or address the changing market conditions?",2024-02-26 04:03:08,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497575,0 days 16:26:39.497575,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b089qm/seeking_advice_230482_roi_considering_property/
1b082kc,investing,What is the point of bonds when you can use CDs?,"I always hear people throw out the idea of a 60/40 portfolio especially as you get older near 45 or 50 & up, but I never understood what the exact point of this is. Bonds behave similar to stocks, when a stock market crash happens like 2022, 2020, 2008 - bonds can get hit just as hard as stocks. Well maybe not quite as hard, but you still lose money if you have 40% of your portfolio in bonds or even if you had 100% of your portfolio in bonds. 

&#x200B;

And for that case most dividend stocks would take a hit too unless it's something that's not directly invested in stocks like JEPI or other derivative based products. Bitcoin got hit pretty hard in the 2020 and 2022 crashes as well, so crypto isn't safe. 

&#x200B;

But CDs - Certificates of Deposts. They are FDIC insured to 250k per account, and if you use Fidelity they can be deposit swept up to 1 million in FDIC insurance. They yield 5.0% to 5.7%, which is better than most bond portfolios over time have yielded, and just 1% off the average return of my wife's Edward Jones portfolio and 2-3% off the average return of the S&P 500. 

&#x200B;

And Certificates of Deposit have ZERO RISK OF DIPPING IN VALUE! Your funds can be locked up, but if this is a retirement strategy, that's actually what you want - you won't be touching it until you retire anyways.

&#x200B;

So are bonds useless if you can put CDs in your Roth IRA? There is no tax advantage what so ever to anything in a Roth as it's all taxed already. If you're in a Traditional IRA, dividends and yield basically are taxed as income anyway so no real advantage either way. So I just don't get why people use bonds if they have the option to balance their portfolio at all.",2024-02-26 03:52:46,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497582,0 days 16:37:01.497583,80,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b082kc/what_is_the_point_of_bonds_when_you_can_use_cds/

1azx4nh,investing,Seeking Insights: Apartment Building vs. Strip Mall Investment in Suburban Growth Area,"I'm contemplating between two real estate investments: a 30-50-unit apartment building at $1,500 rent per unit or a strip mall with 7-12 units, leasing at $15-20/sqft/year for 2,000 sqft spaces. The location is a suburban area near a metropolitan hub, with a growing population.  
I'm looking for your wisdom on a few fronts:  
Profitability: Which type of investment has shown better returns in similar markets? Considerations include construction costs, operating expenses, and income potential.  
Experiences: If you've tackled similar projects, what challenges did you face, and what strategies led to success?  
Market and Location: How do local conditions sway your choice between residential and commercial real estate? What location characteristics are key for success?  
Financing and Taxes: Any advice on handling financing terms and tax implications for such investments?  
I am currently leaning towards the apartment building, because it just feels like a safer option for some reason. Even though the population ere is growing, I will often see stores with for lease signs in the windows and many open spaces. The way I see it, the demand for housing is always there whereas there is probably a limit to the number fo successful shopping areas within a county.

Goldman Sachs Research raised its target for the S&P 500 Index for year-end 2024 from 5,100 to 5,200, representing a gain of 4% from the index's level on February 16. The higher forecast reflects Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin's expectations for stronger economic growth and higher profits from the information technology and communication services sector. This sector is home to five of the Magnificent Seven stocks — the tech companies accounting for about a third of the S&P 500's market capitalization. Our analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings per share of $241 in 2024 and $256 in 2025, up from $237 and $250 previously.  
  
The Magnificent Seven is estimated to have lifted margins in the fourth quarter by 582 basis points (year over year), leading to earnings growth of 58%. By contrast, margins for the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 contracted by 56 basis points and earnings fell by 2% (the declines being driven primarily by energy stocks).",2024-02-25 19:20:43,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497656,1 days 01:09:04.497656,80,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azwatd/forecast_change_the_sp_500_will_rally_higher_than/

1aztgxv,investing,Need advice on my planned strategy.,"I have a lump sum for me to invest into growth products. However, I am quite conservative in investing, and my risk tolerance is low to moderate so I will just do normal etfs and bonds instead of leverage, options or forex, so that I can sleep well during the night. I have made two simple plans that I hope experienced people who have been through high and low in the market can share their thoughts of and give me logical and practical advice, including why they are good or bad plans.

Here is my first plan:

All in TLT. And when the government is going to drop the interest rate, the price will go up, then I will sell it to get capital gain between 15% to 40% based on the historical data, and if the unlikely recession will ever happens, the gain can be even more.

After that, if the market is still hot and unpredictable, I will do fractional share reinvestment with DCA:

25% SCHG
20% Nvdia (stock) or SMH
20% XLK
20% VT
15% Inda

Then in the future, when the stock market is will drop, I will invest the lump sum into them with the same percentage. And maybe one day, when technology is not the driver of the stock market anymore, I can replace technology ETFs with a new sector.

The second plan is to start DCA now, so I don’t waste time while waiting for that capital gain of TLT. 

Please give me some advice and if you think I should alter my planned portfolio.",2024-02-25 17:28:46,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497675,1 days 03:01:01.497676,24,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aztgxv/need_advice_on_my_planned_strategy/
1azt786,investing,Number of customers versus number of accounts at big investment firms ... overstated?,"I'm not sure if this is on topic for this /sr but I wonder if anyone can help,

I'm interested in how many customers or households have accounts at the big U.S. investment firms (like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard).

Folks in this /sr are obviously attuned to investing. But when you consider the entirety of the U.S. population - all the grandmas and folks living paycheck to paycheck and folks new to the U.S. and the fraction of households where concepts like index funds and investing just never were any part of family conversation - I think that a good fraction of the U.S. simply doesn't think of or do any investing. (At least not directly; their employer may sock away money in a 401k for them, but they don't actively manage it or have a personal account where they do their own investing.)

In particular, I'd venture that **less than half of U.S. households have a personal investment account** where they can (and do) buy/sell stocks, index funds, ETFs, etc. (Separate from, e.g., a 401(k) their employers might have made for them ... I mean an account they personally actively made and trade with.)

Where am I going with all this? Let's look at some numbers:

* [The FDIC says](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/index.html) there are \~108 M ""fully banked"" households in the U.S.
* [This recent Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/vanguard-vs-fidelity-4587961) says Vanguard has over 30 M and Fidelity over 43 M ""individual investors""
* [This recent Schwab press release](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2023/Schwab-Reports-Monthly-Activity-Highlights-db1d3b14b/default.aspx) says it has 34 M active brokerage accounts

That's a total of 107 M investment investors and/or accounts (Vanguard 30 + Fidelity 43 + Schwab 34)

Whereas the U.S. has, at most, \~108 M households with bank accounts.

And this 107 only counts three big investment firms when there are [many others](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/largest-stock-brokerage-firms/).

There's just no way that every household in the U.S. that has any bank account, also has a separate investing account they're active in (past their employer's retirement account).

So what exactly is being counted here?

I don't doubt that the counts above (30 to 40 M per firm) are accurate somehow. But ... *how*?

Could this explain it: I personally have a lot going on with a big investing firm. I have a taxable (joint with wife), a Roth IRA, and a Traditional IRA. Also my parents passed, leaving an Inherited set of the same (that's six accounts so far). Then my wife also has her own separate taxable, Roth, and Trad. IRA with that same firm.

So we are one household... but it would also be accurate to say we have nine accounts. (But note that the Investopedia article specifically says *individual investors*, not *accounts.)*

So I guess the bottom line I'm driving at here is: What **percent of households have at least one investment account**, and a direct account at that? (One they actively established and use, separate from any employer retirement accounts)

Where can one find numbers like that, and what would they be called?

But more importantly, is there a way to see this particular number for the big investment firms? (customers or households, NOT ""accounts"")

Something's not right when there's a clear impression that firms' numbers add up to way more investors in the U.S. than even have bank accounts!

I hope this is making sense. Thank you for bearing with me! I appreciate it if you can shed any light on these huge numbers.

**EDIT** a couple of hours after the above OP:

Thanks to you folks responding, I see I need to look deeper. I came across [this FINRA National Financial Capability Study](https://www.finrafoundation.org/knowledge-we-gain-share/nfcs/data-and-downloads)'s 2021 Investor Survey Report, which says (p. 3): ""In 2021, just over a third (**35 percent**) of the national population had investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other securities outside of retirement accounts. There has been a slight upward trend in the percentage of investors since 2015.""

This sounds close to how I would define people or household counts with ""active investing not including employer retirement plans"". IOW, how many *people* are in fact active investors.

But it still doesn't answer the question of how I might find similar numbers for big investment firms. they may well keep this a close-guarded secret.",2024-02-25 17:17:51,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497681,1 days 03:11:56.497681,5,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azt786/number_of_customers_versus_number_of_accounts_at/

We've seen a wave of new developments like apartments and small business buildings offering space for dental clinics, gyms, food parks, and more. This has opened up services that weren't available here before.

Many customers of the said businesses are students from a nearby private school, who tend to be from wealthier families, and employees from a small corporate office. With more apartments being built, I anticipate an increase in potential customers.

I expect these developments to continue in maybe for the next 10+ years and fortunately my house is just around of all these developments, which has me thinking about how I can make the most of these opportunities. I'm in my early 20s and planning for my future, so I'm not in a rush but thinking about possibilities for the next five years or so.

One idea I had was to open a pet supplies store, as there isn't one nearby yet. The number of pet owners are still growing, especially with more couples choosing not to have children.

1azruol,investing,Leveraging Real Estate to reduce Sequence of Return Risk.,"My Portfolio is 95% FNILX and I'd like to keep it that way more or less well into retirement.

I plan to retire with about 2 Million dollars in my portfolio.

I'm not so well-off that I don't have sequence risk though, especially if we're talking about the 1st couple years after retirement, or the year before retirement. My expected withdrawal rate in the first 5 years of retirement is 5 or 5.5%, at which point I reach social security age and withdrawal rate drops down to 3 to 4%.

I'm planning to use the roughly 600k in Home equity I have to bridge this risk. By either refinancing the home, pulling a heloc, a sale, or a number of other ways based on what is most appropriate at that time. If the market takes a big enough crap in this very key year-range.

What I'm curious is... I've seen some numbers tossed around like.. 'the market has a XX% dip every XX many years' and 'the market tends to rebound within xx timeframe' . I am curious if a table or mathematical formula for ... let's say 'buying the dip' exists in relation to sequence risk in retirement.

Example: "" If the market goes down 10%, I will...    "" vs. 15% or 20%, etc etc.

My thought process had been, a 10% hit to the market and I might utilize a Heloc for a years worth of spending, if the market takes a 20% hit I might refinance the home, take 18 months of living expenses as cash, and add the rest of my equity to the portfolio to buy the dip. But these are just vague, feelings-based numbers I pulled off the top of my head.

I am wondering if anyone or any webpage has mathed this out extensively because I would be very interested in seeing that data and where my real numbers should be for these decisions. It would kind of be similar to the probabilities involved in 'buying the dip' so if you have some great math on that topic you think would be helpful I would be interested in reading that as well.

Say an MSCI World value, quality, small cap and momentum ETF in a, say, 10/10/5/5 ratio. Another possiblity I thought about is using an equal weighted world ETF. The equal weighted S&P 500 has historically (going back decades, not just the recent past) outperformed the market weighted ETF, so using an equal weighted world ETF seems to make sense instead of the VWCE world.

Owe: $94,289 with 140 payments left

Car is $12,000 @0.0% so not worried.

Options

1. Pay $250 extra a month. Ending mortgage 3 years early

2. Invest $250/mo into stocks and let my money grow.

3. Invest $250/mo in stocks at higher rate until I can lump sum the rest of the mortgage off with the growth.

4. Invest $250/mo in high yield dividend ETFs paying monthly/quarterly and instead of reinvesting for now use the dividends to pay down the mortgage? 

5. Put $125/mo to mortgage and $125/mo to high yield dividend ETFs and reinvesting the dividends.
(This is what I have set up now until I can wrap my head around it)

I’ve tried to calculate the different paths but honestly I’m way over my head.

1azdmrw,investing,I Bonds as the best safe asset for tax purposes?,"While most of my portfolio is in VT, having some portion in a safe inflation protected asset is appealing. I'm thinking I Bonds might be the best way to go (simply buy the max every year, forever).  
  
My understanding is that in general people are lukewarm on I Bonds because TIPS or HYSA or money market funds can provide higher returns and be more flexible. However, I'm not so sure this is true for my circumstance for a few reasons.  
  
(1) I Bonds are state/local tax free. I have an over 10% state + local tax rate now, so this is meaningful. Some other assets also have this property, but I don't right now know of any others which also have....  
  
(2) You can defer paying tax until redeeming. Right now my marginal tax rate is near 50%. So I make 5% on a HYSA and lose half of it. But in theory if I just hold the I Bonds until retirement (where my income will certainly be way way lower) then I will pay significantly less tax on the interest then I would along the way via HYSA/tips/money market etc.  
  
So my questions are: Does anything else also have the combo property of (1) and (2)? Or even just (2)...  
  
And is this actually likely to be worth the difference in returns compared to other safe options? Understood if it's sort of impossible to know but would appreciate some input.

1azcfte,investing,Roll overs and self management,"Okay there's a few different things in here so I'll try my best to lay it all out.

Current situation:

\- 5% of my income goes in a trad 401k for the company match

\-  I use a trad IRA to backdoor in a Roth IRA every year

\- I invest some extra in a taxable account

&#x200B;

First question is that I want to roll over my 401k every 2 months and self manage in my trad IRA. I do not plan to backdoor these contributions because it's going to increase my tax burden and I'd rather defer some taxation for now. By doing this, does it impact my annual contribution to the trad IRA that I then roll over to a Roth? I'm not sure how the pro rata rule factors in here if at all.

My second question, is I have the option to also participate in a Roth 401k. For this scenario I'm assuming my entire match is for the trad contribution, so I could just roll over some extra capital into my Roth IRA every month. However if I decide I want the Roth contributions matched and I roll over, what tax consequences could I be looking at? If I ever wanted to withdraw the 'contributions' from the Roth IRA are matches considered gains or contributions?

Basically I want to self manage my 401k by rolling it into my IRAs and want to figure out the most efficient and least tax consequential method of doing so. I want to add a Roth 401k contribution to roll over and not sure which one to add the company match on.

1azbrf7,investing,"I'm ready to make a prediction.
","The bubble will pop.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

I recently sold my house in CA, and moved out of state. I plan on buying another home sometime in 2025, so wondering what to do with the around $500,000 after taxes profit I made. I have a Wealthfront savings account set up (5% apy) with most of the money - normally I’d throw this to an investor, but hoping for gain  with a 1 year timeline in the stock market is a risk it’d rather not take. I’m not fully risk averse - but last time I was buying a house I invested my down payment with a Robo investor and ended up -12% on the year, so would rather not go through that again. 

TLDR: 1 year investment length, is 5% in a high yield savings the best bet? I know there are I-bonds but don’t know enough about limits, hence me asking y’all. 

Thank you! ",2024-02-24 23:40:16,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497796,1 days 20:49:31.497796,36,0.46,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1az934u/just_sold_my_house_ideas_for_1_year_investments/
1az8jex,investing,What are ways you have invested in your home that have yielded the highest annual ROI?,"Here are the big ones for me:

* Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high.
* Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more.
* All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights.
* Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.

The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.

I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.

What were things that worked for you? I'm happy for both big and little things alike.",2024-02-24 23:16:20,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497799,1 days 21:13:27.497800,179,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1az8jex/what_are_ways_you_have_invested_in_your_home_that/
1az86v6,investing,"IBKR offers good value, even in a scenario with lower interest rates","Interactive Brokers is a low-cost electronic brokerage. 74.6% of the company is held by its founder Thomas Jefferffy, leaving only about 25.4% of the company as free float in the market.  
  
The company went public in 2007 being mainly a market maker for options. As the market-making business declined, IBKR pivoted toward automatic electronic brokerage, selling the market-maker part of the business. Since then, the company has steadily increased users and equity from users.  
  
Given that they’re a low-cost provider of brokerage, highly focused on technology and automatization, their net margins are really high. That’s why, if they focus on growth, it will translate into the net margins straight away.  
  
  
  
Dividend? Buybacks? Nah  
  
  
  
The company has stated in its earnings call for Q4 2023 that increasing dividends or buying back shares are unlikely to happen. They are accumulating earnings to grow, most likely through an acquisition.  
  
The company is relentlessly focused on growth. As they don’t think that paying more dividends or buying back shares will increase the growth of the company in the long run, they will not do it. Instead, they’re scrutinizing the market to acquire a competitor. That would mean instant growth both in revenues and net margin. However, we’ve widely seen how acquisitions all over the world, and in all industries, usually destroy value. Of course, it all depends on the discipline and patience of the management team to not rush on a deal because they have the money in their hands.  
  
The future is uncertain, though. And although I’m sure that acquiring a competitor may excite the market, it may not be the best way to go. Anyway, they operate in a great industry, with good margins. So maybe declining interest rates give them an opportunity to acquire a good business at a good price.  
  
INTRINSIC VALUE OF IBKR  
  
There is a margin of safety if we estimate that the interest rates will go down to 2%. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the margin of safety is wide.  
  
Assuming the above, the normalized net profit for the company would be sitting at $1.812M. This would mean a total market value of $49.249M, or said otherwise, a 15.68% margin of safety compared to today’s price (February 16th, 2024). For this company, given its quality, growth, and earnings visibility, I have found fair a PE ratio of 27.18 times. The required margin of safety for this company would be 12.54%, which makes IBKR a buy today. Please refer to the PE calculation at the end of the document for further details.  
  
Note about the interest rates and the normalized net profit. The company stated in the Q4 2023 conference call that every 25 basis points decrease in the benchmark would result in a $56M reduction in net income. Thus, this would mean a reduction of $784M, in line with our normalized net profit.  
  
However, the company has stated that they will be pursuing an acquisition. I haven’t accounted for the excess cash as part of the base (normalized) valuation since the management is not giving it back to shareholders. But they will be pursuing an acquisition. Assuming that they won’t allocate all their excess cash to this acquisition (they have stated that they will pursue a payment based on cash and stocks), I think that a probable scenario would be a $7B acquisition. Assuming a poor return on the acquisition of 5% net profit, that would add $350M in net profits to the company. Assuming the same PE as before, the margin of safety would increase to 38.03%. All of this, assuming lower interest rates.  
  
I consider the current M.O.S. compelling enough to invest in the company. There’s plenty of upside while the downside of the investment looks reduced. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the share price won’t fall, especially if interest rates start declining, but it won’t be a decrease in value. Rather, it would represent an outstanding investment opportunity. However, the fact that the company is not willing to buy back shares or increase its dividend is also worth noting. I don’t think that the company will waste its money on acquisitions since the management has stated that they have refused two potential acquisitions due to price discrepancies. But if they do, we should revisit the assumptions made to give IBKR a PE ratio of 27 times.

Now, I think it’s not by design, but we aren’t adventurous folks, spend on things we don’t actually want or don’t to live lavishly — hence what we’re able to achieve. We don’t have kids (Pet dog only) or are in financial/credit card debt. We don’t really go on frequent vacation.. just call us boring or “not living life.” We consider ourselves homebodies and prefer to be home 80% of the time. My wife likes to be on her phone for social media, take care of her indoor house plants, cooks and bakes, and watches her trash shows. And I’m more technology guy where I’m naturally sitting and in front of the computer monitor either gaming, web browsing, and working on creative projects (And workout and do cardio).I honestly do think our habits and view on “living life” will finally change when we’re really comfortable and well-prepared financially for our retirement — which we’re planning an early retirement in our late-50s.

Are we approaching this correctly where we aren't enjoying ourselves as much now? Or, reap the rewards in our retirement but will be older versions of ourselves where we could have enjoyed things when we were a bit younger?

1az1tt0,investing,Looking for advice regarding 529 vs. investing for my son.,"So, I was going to open a 529 account for my 4yr old today, but then I thought back and recalled someone speaking about perhaps just strictly investing (S&P500 only perhaps?) for their kids and not using a 529. Perhaps I'm misremembering or misconstruing the original post I read though, but I believe it was basically stressing that kids would be better off with parents going the investing route.

My two stepsons both have Greenlight accounts and 529 accounts. Their mom makes occasional investments for them long-term through Greenlight on certain stocks, and they can use their Greenlight cards for purchasing things occasionally with approval. I'm trying to start a game plan for my 4 year old.

&#x200B;

* 529 route limits spending to educational purposes and living, correct?
   * Upside: Tax free for college spending.
   * Downside: Limited to college spending. Low interest rate.
* Investing (perhaps just S&P500?), would be more lucrative and perhaps pan out better? 
   * Upside: Earn more money off of the investments after taxes vs. tax free 529. Can spend anywhere as needed once cashed out.
   * Downside: Taxed whenever deciding to sell. Can lose money on investments if buying into the wrong choices or a market crash.

Let me know your thoughts, because again, I feel like maybe I've confused things. Looking for good direction to go for my boy so that he's in good shape when he's older.

However I've been thinking about the relaation of ethics and investing as there are some companies that I'm pretty sure will grow in the near future but I DON'T want to support as some of these companies are against my personal code of ethics.

 We literally have the FED chairman whispering to the markets every couple of months,, teasing gently with rate cuts etc. 

How is it that one man wields so much control over markets that are supposed to be ""free"" and based on company performance?


All everyone ever says whether its in real life or reddit is the following ""invest in your 401k and VOO for 40 years and everything will be ok"".  

No one ever acknowledges the elephant in the room. That the markets are being propped up by stimulus, qe , unlimited debt, and the promise of rate cuts. If any of the above gets removed...401ks, housing equity,banks will drop like a rock overnight.  Its alll faith based.  Does that sound like a healthy market to you? It is a big farce. 

When i bring this up...no one ever says im wrong.  They tell me to go away and say a variation of the following : "" hey the markets only go up.  They have been calling for recession forever now,,and it never happens"" ""go away. Buy guns and ammo you weirdo""   


I dont expect the average person to know this. (Since most people dont  follow  fiscal policy closely)


But for those that know better , we have to start addressing this and start discussing how to hedge just in case the same ""buy the dip"" stradegy of the past 25 years fails.  We owe it to the future generations to be honest about whats going on in this country with the economy amd markets. We need to get our collective heads out of the sand and discuss this consistently openly and honestly.  Make it normal and remove the taboo. 

 investment subs continue to sweep this under the rug as if this isnt a glaring issue.  At what cost do we keep assett prices going up forever??? Massive inflation for your children???  

What will it take for society to stop being short-sighted and let all markets reset for the greater good of the future?

Should i stick with 30% in bond index or maybe allocate something to the money market? 

Or ditch the bond index and send 30% to money market as true stable, extremely low risk ""savings"" account.  The returns for 10yr LOF are 1.06% for money market and 1.6% for bond index.

1ayr42z,investing,Nvidia's AI moat is both more and less than you might think,"Nvidia seems to be a really hot topic here with the recent AI craze so I figured I should chime in some thoughts I don't see mentioned enough or at all. *This will get a tiny bit technical.*

Nvidia's current dominance in both gaming performance and deep learning performance is undisputed. What people often overlook though is that Nvidia's cards can also be used for accelerating (among others) 1) rendering workloads (e.g. animations and effects for commercials or movies), 2) physics simulations, 3) video transcoding (maybe video content platforms?), and 4) non-deep-learning-based machine learning.

## Nvidia's moat is less than you might think

For **inference** and specifically **edge** workloads, Nvidia's moat is tiny to non-existent.

Nvidia faces competition from Google (TPUs), Intel / Apple / Snapdragon / others (AI on CPUs and SBCs), Intel / AMD (GPUs), Intel / Google / others (accelerators / compute sticks), and everyone who has any sort of custom chip. 

Various ML/AI models running on flagship phones, VR headsets, internet browsers, SBCs, and even gaming PCs (e.g. upscalers) have been running on ARM, Intel, and AMD chips for nearly a decade. Even LLMs have been receiving some love and work on getting them running on CPUs and AMD GPUs, with the smaller models (1-7B, especially aggressively-quantized ones) running somewhat decently on just CPU+RAM (e.g. 1-2 words / second on a RaspberryPi 5). 

> But is this representative of the industry? 

Well, kinda. Edge inferencing (smartphone, VR, SBCs, browser, ...) is growing and will probably continue to grow quickly. Small LLMs are also **very** relevant to large tech companies (my current employer primarily uses 7-70B models for most products, plus OpenAI / Microsoft / AWS / Anthropic integrations) for both fine-tuning and inferencing. My wider department has 10+ projects working on such LLMs and services around them. AMD GPUs for inferencing are also gaining steam with projects like vLLM adding support (Jan 2024) for ROCm.

> Wait a moment, you mentioned fine-tuning. You don't do that on a CPU or AMD GPU, right?

Correct, which brings us to...

## Nvidia's moat is more than you might think

While inferencing can happen (and does happen) anywhere (e.g. we're using non-GPU instances for quite a few workloads), **training** and **fine-tuning** *only ever happens on Nvidia GPUs*. There a few reasons for that.

First, training and fine-tuning are way more intensive (and thus require more acceleration) than other workloads, so fully leveraging Nvidia's acceleration capabilities is critical. It's not just CUDA and deep learning frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, ...). There are over 20 really popular projects that are directly based on Nvidia GPUs (e.g. TensorRT-LLM, cuFFT, cuBLAS, cudf, nvvl, ...) or only come with CUDA-support out of the box (e.g. RAPIDS, XGBoost). 

Even if/when other GPUs/accelerators fully catch up (which will take a while even when pooling AMD and community contributions), that would still not be enough. Training & fine-tuning on just one GPU is not very common anymore. Even for a smaller non-LLM model I trained early last year, I had to use 4-8 GPUs for a reasonable training completion time. For LLMs, it's even worse; you often need multiple GPUs on multiple servers and pooling them is no easy task. *And even if you implement the pooling of those GPUs in software (e.g. AMD contributes to pytorch/tensorflow), then you would still lag behind Nvidia*, simply because they have also done work for that on the hardware side (e.g. NVLink/NVSwitch, DGX/OVX systems).

Finally, inferencing. I touched on this in the previous section and mentioned that Nvidia might not be a monopoly, but that was only partially true. While inferencing with decent quality and latency can and does happen on other devices, inferencing at scale massively benefits from being done on a single place (e.g. on some cloud with Nvidia GPUs) both from a cost standpoint (resource management & economies of scale) and a latency one. Both AMD and Intel have tons of data center experience, but they just aren't there yet, and these take years to develop.

## Conclusion

Will edge inferencing eat away at Nvidia's earnings? Nah, these were mostly separated from the beginning, and disproportionate increases of edge over cloud computing are not something I'd bet on. Will people keep buying Nvidia GPUs like they do now? No idea, but large data centers (e.g. AWS, Azure, Meta) will re-cycle their GPUs every a few years to get the newest (and supported) stuff, and by the time the next cycle comes, I think the overwhelming majority of sales will still end up Nvidia's way. 2-3 cycles later? No idea, but Nvidia's sales still won't be low because supporting legacy systems is an almost-necessary thing. Is the valuation of today pricing all these in? No idea. Is AI a bubble? Nope, LLMs and prompting may or may not be, but AI (or ML) doesn't end there. The hype around AI may subside, as it has done 3-5 times in the past, but we still haven't fully exported the possibilities of the the current wave so let's not kill it too early.

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth.

1ayh52b,investing,UGMA - Custodial Broker Account,"Hi investors!
Looking for advice…
I’m having my second child next month, and once she gets a SSN, I was planning on opening a UGMA for her and one for my 17 month old son.
Does anyone recommend a good brokerage to go through? Like Fidelity or Vanguard?
Somewhere user friendly lol

I have a financial advisor at Raymond James, I think he’s retiring soon, but would prefer to kind of do this myself and allocate online and once the kids are old enough, choose investments together.

I’m consciously considering a UGMA over a 529, leaving the decision up to my kids about college, etc.  We live in CT, they’ll be 21 when the account transfer to them, and I’m feeling pretty hopeful I’ll raise them right to not piss away my efforts lol I know it’ll all be theirs and ultimately I’ll have no say. 

Also, once I do open the accounts, any recommendations on what to invest in to start with?  Like VOO or VTI?

Was planning on an initial deposit of around 1-2k each, then make contributions around the holidays of a couple hundred.  Unless we should plan for more?

Any help is appreciated!  Thank you!!",2024-02-24 00:50:33,2024-02-26 20:29:47.497914,2 days 19:39:14.497914,5,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ayh52b/ugma_custodial_broker_account/

I guess my question is, is there a fixed cost basis for when that stock was distributed? Is there a standard way to track that down?

1ay8rhw,investing,opinions on my investment strategy.,"Hi there! I’m looking for some opinions on my investment strategy.

Assume this scenario:  
\- Mid 30’s.  
\- Saving \~100k per year.  
\- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.  
\- Wanting to “retire” in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.

The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I’m not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I’m fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.

I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I’m thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.

I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.

My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV. If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.

Is there anything I’m missing or not considering?

1ay852f,investing,Do all stocks go up because one stock goes up?,"NVDA is a $2 trillion company, which is the third largest American company. As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,

Because this leads to an unintuitive conclusion in my head: given two stocks A and B that have zero alpha and high beta in unrelated sectors. News that affects the price of stock A causes an effect on the price stock B simply because of their beta values.",2024-02-23 18:40:11,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617197,3 days 01:49:37.617198,73,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay852f/do_all_stocks_go_up_because_one_stock_goes_up/

1ay6u5t,investing,401k reallocation at market peaks,"Hello.

My 401k is underperforming the general market because of my current allocation:

43% large cap growth index
43% large cap value index
13% small cap index

Generally I'm looking to be 100% in index funds and match the annual performance of a major index like S&P or NASDAQ. 

So the 56% of my portfolio in value and small cap is dragging my overall performance as compared to S&P and NASDAQ.

I'm going to reallocate but since S&P and NASDAQ are at all time highs, I don't think it's a good time to move large chunks of money in.

I've changed my future contributions to buy 100% large cap growth. I'm comfortable with a DCA approach on my contributions.

I'm considering just holding my current assets until there is a dip in the large cap growth or a big spike in the value.

What's your approach with reallocation at our current ATHs?

On the other hand, I still have stock invested, so I certainly want to see the price go up, whether I sell a portion of it or not.

So maybe it's always a win/win situation.  Or maybe always lose/lose?   Can it somehow always be neutral -- the price doesn't matter *at all* when you sell a small number of shares?  So confusing.

I suppose it depends on the % you sell -- for a small sale %, you still *always* root for the price to go up and never worry about selling a few at the right time.  Just sell and move on.   Only for a large sale % does it make sense to ""root"" for the price to go down.

1ay01bj,investing,The Rise of Old West Carson City Coins: A Digital Era Investment Opportunity,"  
In the fast-paced world of digital transactions and virtual currencies, the allure of physical coins with historical significance is experiencing a resurgence. Among these coveted treasures are the Old West Carson City coins, particularly Morgan Dollars, Twenty Cent Pieces, and Trade Dollars. While these coins have long held value among numismatists and collectors, recent shifts in global currency dynamics are poised to exponentially increase their worth.  
  
As the world steadily progresses towards the widespread adoption of digital central bank currencies, the role of physical currency is undergoing a transformation. The elimination of physical currency is not merely a hypothetical scenario but an inevitable reality as governments and financial institutions embrace the efficiency and security offered by digital transactions.  
  
This seismic shift in currency dynamics will have profound implications for physical coins with historical significance, such as those minted in Carson City during the Old West era. As physical currency becomes increasingly scarce, the demand for tangible assets with intrinsic value has been  skyrocketing. Elite collectors and savvy investors alike are seeking out coins with rich historical narratives and tangible scarcity.  
  
Among the most sought-after Old West Carson City coins are Morgan Silver Dollars, with the highest demand for the CC-minted 1889 Morgan, CC-minted Twenty Cent Pieces, and CC-minted Trade Dollars. These coins, minted in limited quantities and imbued with the spirit of the Wild West era, hold a unique appeal for collectors and investors seeking tangible assets with enduring value.  
  
The distinctive ""CC"" mint mark, signifys their origin in the heart of the Old West.   
  
Twenty Cent Pieces minted in Carson City are prized for their rarity and historical significance. Minted for only a brief period from 1875 to 1878, these coins represent a fascinating chapter in American coinage history.  The Trade Dollars minted in Carson City are also poised to experience a surge in demand among elite collectors. These coins, originally minted for trade with China and other Asian markets, hold a unique place in American numismatic history. 

As the world adapts to digital central bank currencies attentive Investors are beginning to seek out tangible assets with historical significance, and it's driving demand and increasing their value to unprecedented heights. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity that many Investors will miss. While the opportunity is here and now for physical, tangible investments most Investors are looking in the wrong direction for new opportunities.

I have absolutely no knowledge of investing, so I would like to hear inputs from more qualified people.

For context: I work for a telecom company, and in the past they have not offered stock option for employees. now, suddenly the company announced that they would offer stock purchase for employees because apparently ""many people voiced their request, and we heard"".

Here's the thing: from what I observed, the stock option doesn't give employees any type of discount for the purchase. Also, instead of letting employees purchase directly, the company is offering it through their retirement funds.

I felt that there's something wrong and looked up the company's stock performance, and in the past 5 years, the company's stock values has doubled between 2020 and 2021, but from then on it dropped back down to half its values from peak.

I wanted to know what you guys think, because I feel like this is a bad idea.",2024-02-23 07:31:05,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617281,3 days 12:58:43.617282,9,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axuql4/is_this_a_sign_that_the_company_is_struggling/
1axrow5,investing,"Healthcare ETF for HSA, specifically VHT","I saw a pretty interesting strategy the other day and wanted to hear the communities’ thoughts on it.

If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu

However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.

It’s sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there’s universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you’ll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

1axqdrd,investing,Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.  
  
<video here>  
  
The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.  
  
I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.  
  
That's not what is going on here.  
  
First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.  
  
NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.  
  
With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.  
  
Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.  
  
Maybe Dan is just confused.  
  
Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.  
  
There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.  
  
Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.  
  
See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.  
  
Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".  
  
That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.  
  
Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.  
  
Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.  
  
Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?  
  
Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.  
  
It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.  
  
MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.  
  
Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.  
  
Data gets stored and then you access said data.  
  
LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.  
  
The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.  
  
The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.  
  
The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.  
  
There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.  
  
There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.",2024-02-23 03:23:52,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617301,3 days 17:05:56.617302,22,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/

Hi all,

My spouse and I have about $500k in a MMF currently generating interest at 5.43% and are looking to make a better use of the money until we buy a house in 2-3 years.

As the title suggests, I am considering investing in Venture Funds. For context, I normally invest with Schwab, but I have a SoFi account and am considered a “SoFi Plus Member” (whatever that means) so I received a notification about IPO access and ended up getting distracted while checking it out and started looking into their Venture Fund offerings - which is why I’m writing this post.

I’m asking because, although they’re already risky, I noticed that they have insane gross/net expense ratios compared to ETFs, making them even more risky. 

Taking calculated, sensible risk that I can justify isn’t really something that typically bothers me, but this seems kind of like instead of mitigating my risk, I’m just hedging my risk with even more risk. On the bright side, the investment minimums are low, so that definitely counts as a positive! 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 
Some examples of the rates are below.

Fund 1 - $2500 minimum, 5.7%gross expense ratio / 2.9%net expense ratio

I recently came across this YouTube channel: Ted Wainman @ Talk Financials (https://youtube.com/@TalkFinancials?si=2rrvWD6vjYYVTaqZ).
This is the type of content I'm looking for. Someone taking you through a company report, looking at the financials and explaining why they think it's a good investment or not. So basically someone that uses real-world scenarios examples and case studies.

So I have a regular brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I set up through Vanguard in 2019. My Roth IRA is almost exclusively VOO and VXUS but my brokerage has a mix of a lot of ETFS, from VOO to SCHG to VXUS to ACWI to VUG (a lot of overlap and just kind of random, I know). 

So, my question is if you guys invest differently in your Roth IRA vs your non-tax advantaged brokerage. I definitely want to be a bit more conservative in my Roth IRA, but I want to be a bit more risky in my brokerage. Is this sensible? What do you guys do?

1axei3n,investing,Nvidia-fueled tech rally puts Nasdaq Composite record in sight,"Hah. I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago!  

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era

From MarketWatch:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-fueled-tech-rally-puts-nasdaq-composite-record-in-sight-59951214?g=ad5aec42-f1a1-40d9-aa8d-ab928ce5fed8&mod=djem_mwnbulletin

> An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**

> The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.

> If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Wow

> The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024.

> The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, 

There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days. 

Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. 

Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn’t go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.

1axdh13,investing,"How can I reprogram my mind to be ok with large winners, and to cut losses when it's beneficial. ","I'm still a 'baby' investor of around 3 years, but I think I've done well psychologically on being calm when prices fall, and not getting over excited when they increase a lot. At least on broad market indexes. 

For individual stocks positions, however, I find myself struggling to hold on to EXTREMELY large winners, when I do have them. I know the phrase goes, ""water your flowers and cut your weeds"", or something like that. But for example, I've been trimming my meta position, which is currently up almost 200%. And have been trimming since it hit around 170-80% return (money weighted). On one hand, I do believe the market is in a frenzy, and don't feel comfortable in what could be a bubble, but am I being too fearful of profits? 

I'm not asking for personal advice on one stock in particular, rather, how to be more comfortable with letting winners run. But perhaps I already am, since I held for so long, and am only worried now with how hyped the market is? 

Another thing, is cutting losses. On a few stocks, I'm down 20-30%, and while I'm not uncomfortable with holding where I see a positive future, in some companies I don't. I know it's sunk cost fallacy, but my own psychology won't let me let go of those positions. Advice here also welcome.

Was not really sure where to ask this, so forgive me if this is the wrong place. But back in 2021 the company I was and still working for was acquired by a much larger multi billion dollar company that is owned by a Private Equity firm. At that point in time i was offered roughly 20,000 shares at ZERO COST to me which would vest over 4 years. I am currently about 65% vested.

However, the PE firm is considering a sale of the company i work for at which point i become 100% vested. As part of the liquidity event, would I possibly be entitled to get paid? My incentive equity agreement only outlines how my shares would vest in the event of a private sale or IPO, nothing about value/number of outstanding shares, or what would happen to my shares in the event of a sale.

1axawcd,investing,When is the best time to roll an IRA to Roth? ,"I had an old 401k from a previous job that was performing atrociously for years, and I decided to roll it to an IRA to get better investment options. Mission accomplished, and it's now growing comfortably, but I'm realizing that I might want to use the backdoor Roth strategy in the future, and would be hit by the pro-rata rule. 

When would be the best time to roll this thing to Roth? Are there any strategies that would make this easier? Some considerations:

- The current size of the account is $12k. I could afford the taxes on that, but it would eat up nearly the entire raise I just got.

- The markets are at all-time highs. I know it would be best to roll when the markets are down, but there's no way to time a crash. The longer I wait to roll, the higher my tax bill could potentially get. 

- I don't expect to lose my job anytime soon, but who does? 

Is it better to put off paying taxes as long as possible, but potentially pay higher total taxes in the long-term through pro-rata as the account grows?

The 401k is put into the Vanguard Target Retire 2060 Trust 1 and it through Empower (previously Prudential) and I'm contributing 6% pre-tax. My employer match should also be 6%. 


My questions are as follows:
1) What is the safe harbor match?  

2) Is the 2060 Trust 1 a good investment to be putting my 401k into?


Thank you for your time!

1ax6z9k,investing,Discover how Draganfly Inc.'s underwritten public offering in the U.S.,"From canada with love 

“Yet, the path to expansion is not without its hurdles. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions, including the green light from the Canadian Securities Exchange and a nod from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Such regulatory landscapes are complex and demand careful navigation. Draganfly's move is underpinned by a solid legal framework, leveraging an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside the company's Canadian short form base shelf prospectus. The anticipation builds as the final terms of the offering are to be disclosed in a final prospectus supplement, a document that will mark the culmination of meticulous planning and strategic foresight.”

1ax4p7i,investing,Time for UPRO/TMF? Alternative for TMF?,"I have been observing how the hedgefundie (UPRO/TMF) strategy has been performing, and many were quick to declare it dead following rising interest rates wiping stock and bond returns over the past few years.

But, I ask, is it now not a good time to start? Interest rates are finally stable, and there is positive outlook for them to start going down. S&P is picking up and already reached peak levels. My only hesitation is TMF - has it really hit rock bottom or not? Is there a different asset we could replace TMF with, which we have confidence in, while still capturing the UPRO upside and allowing some hedging?

1ax2fmy,investing,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don’t teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don’t outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don’t always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don’t think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don’t know what that is, just follow your intuition. It’s your best guide. Don’t choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets — like different industries and geographies — that will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that’s best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don’t want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don’t generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don’t make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don’t obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don’t revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path. One that this universe has crafted just for you.",2024-02-22 09:32:57,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617439,4 days 10:56:51.617439,29,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ax2fmy/wealth_advice_i_would_give_to_my_younger_self/
1awyoh4,investing,Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number,"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. 

> Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. 

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

1awwhhr,investing,Am I on the right track with investments? ,"Trying to figure out if I’m in a good place for my age (30 years old). I think I’d like to retire at 55-60 years old. I currently do not have any debt(no car payment, I always pay my cc each month, student loans paid for, and no mortgage). I do not own, I rent. It’s expensive where I am and at this point I don’t have a 20% down payment for a home - plus the homes where I live are just beyond outrageous. I think I’m fine renting for awhile. 

I am contributing 10% of my income to my 401K. Currently around 70K in there. I obviously didn’t always contribute that much but I’ve made more money over the years as I’ve moved up with my company.  They match 6%. I am considering bumping this up even more - probably 15 percent which is still a little below max contribution but my commission can vary so I want to be cautious. I also am almost making too much money for a Roth IRA. 

I am a part of an Employee stock purchase plan which offers stock at a discount and have been contributing 5% of my paycheck for the last almost 7 years. I also have received RSUs each year and am receiving even more per year with a promotion. So total value of this is 71K with a potential value of 18K that hasn’t vested yet - and more RSUs to come each year. 

A few years ago I started a health savings account. Currently only putting in what my company matches which is $750. So that’s 1500 a year. I’ve not invested any of this but am considering it. I have about 5K in there. 

After just staring at my dividends and unsure what to do with them (probably should have reinvested but whatever 🫠) I decided to use them to buy 6 shares of the ETF ITOT. I’m going to start off with 100 bucks a month into this but want to see how increasing my 401K contributions plays out financially first. The ETF world is a little new to me. Just starting out. A lot of my 401K is invested in vanguard so I figured it would be good to do an ETF that wasn’t vanguard for diversification reasons? This could be inaccurate thinking so open to feedback here. 

I’ve been saving since I got my job 7 years ago. I use to make much less so it’s been an up hill climb. But I have 26 grand in savings which I feel is a little disappointing. I have also just never really heard of a High Yield Savings account until recently so I just moved everything over and started saving in that account last year. I was putting around 250 a paycheck in there for around 6 years (having to dip in occasionally for unexpected vet or car bills for example). If my commission checks were a lot and I had left over pay I’d just send it over to the savings account. I now put around 600-1000 a month in the savings account depending on commission checks. I know it will grow faster because my contribution amount has increased recently but idk not feeling great about it. 

But anyways - is this a good place to be financially? Any advice at all? I’m always over fixating and worrying I’m not doing enough.

1awqkqx,investing,Matt Levine (Bloomberg) on the upcoming reddit IPO,"Matt Levine is alway funny and interesting and he hits on all the pluses and the many minuses regarding the reddit IPO and the supposed offer to some redditors. The thing about reddit is that it is just that, reddit. There isn't much of a moat, just ask the Digg guys how that went.


I guess there are three ways to look at this:

Reddit plans to place a big chunk of its IPO shares in the hands of its users, an unusual move that could build loyalty but also comes with risk. 

The company plans to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, according to people familiar with the matter. The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors. 

Ideally for the company and its underwriters, Reddit shares will rise in their stock-market debut, bestowing big gains on those who buy in at the IPO price. If the stock falls, however, it could anger those members of Reddit’s community — a group that, broadly speaking, hasn’t shied away from boycotts in the past.

Banks generally favor selling the bulk of an IPO to big money managers that tend to hold stocks for a relatively long time. Individual investors are viewed as more fickle and prone to selling at the first sign of weakness.

One is the sort of philosophical view. Reddit Inc., more so even than most social media companies, is a publisher that doesn’t pay its writers and editors. It runs a website that publishes huge amounts of content on various message boards; the boards are mostly moderated by volunteers and the content is written by users. From this, Reddit generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from ads and data. For the most part, the users do not really share in that revenue.

This model works fine — It is in fact the case that the users happily post and moderate on Reddit without getting paid! There is no need to pay them! — but it is awkward, particularly when an initial public offering is set to value the company at more than $5 billion. “We created $5 billion of value and get none of it,” some redditors will probably complain. Letting them buy stock at the IPO price doesn’t really address that complaint — they still have to pay for it! — but it sort of symbolically responds to it. “We let our users share in our success, by paying full price for the stock,” Reddit can say; it’s fine, whatever.[1]

The second is the conventional capital markets view. Here, the rough idea is that banks sell the stock in an IPO mostly to big institutional investors, most of whom they expect to buy and hold the stock. Then the next day, the stock opens for trading, and lots of people — institutions that didn’t get allocations, but also retail investors — want to buy it. But there’s not a lot for sale, because most of the IPO was placed with long-term holders. So there’s a lot of demand and not much supply, so the stock goes up, creating an “IPO pop.” This means that it is generally good to get an allocation in the IPO: You buy stock in the IPO, and the next day it reasonably predictably goes up and you make money. And retail investors mostly don’t get to buy a lot of stock in IPOs, so they miss out on this pop.

Letting individual redditors buy stock in the IPO sort of addresses this problem: The redditors get to buy stock at the institutional price, and then it goes up and they make money. On the other hand, if you let the retail investors buy in the IPO, that kind of ruins the mechanism that leads to the IPO pop? The devoted retail investors who want to buy the stock do so in the IPO, rather than having to wait until the next day, so there’s not as much demand when the stock opens for trading. And a lot of those retail investors might be looking to make a quick buck by flipping the stock, so there is more supply. So there’s less reason to expect a pop. “If everyone buys at the IPO price then there’ll be no one waiting to buy it the next day,” I wrote, when Robinhood Markerts Inc. tried this sort of thing, “and everyone who bought it to make a quick profit will be selling it at a loss.” (That did happen to Robinhood, though then it rallied hard the week after its IPO, so who knows.)

The third is the meme-stock corporate finance view. Most companies are mostly owned by big institutional investors, there are fairly traditional ways to keep those investors happy (steadily increasing earnings, clear communications, stock buybacks, etc.), keeping those investors happy keeps the stock price up, and a high stock price is good for the executives (who get paid largely in stock) and for the company (if it ever needs to raise money by selling more stock). But in the 2020s, some companies are owned in large part by retail investors, and some of those investors are more interested in being part of an online community of investors, and trading jokes and memes, than they are in financial analysis. And you can make those investors happy in less traditional ways, like by giving them popcorn or buying a gold mine or doing a YouTube interview with no pants on.

Lots of corporate executives want nothing to do with this, but some executives lean into it. And why not? Sometimes companies (1) need to raise money (because their business is in trouble) and (2) can’t do the traditional things that make investors happy (because their business is in trouble). Having some source of funding that is orthogonal to traditional business success seems like a good insurance policy: “If our business ever gets into trouble and we need money, we can always make some jokes with our retail investors and they’ll give us the money.” 

Not every company can get meme-stock investors. But you know who probably can? The whole idea of meme stocks originates with Reddit; Reddit’s boards are where the great meme stocks were created; Reddit is where the online communities of investors are. Surely Reddit has some advantages in appealing to retail investors on Reddit. It might as well get some of them in its stock early.",2024-02-21 23:12:25,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617481,4 days 21:17:23.617482,36,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awqkqx/matt_levine_bloomberg_on_the_upcoming_reddit_ipo/

1awpej3,investing,After the Bell: Nvidia clobbers earnings expectations as AI demand hits ‘tipping point’; stock up 6%,"I haven’t seen this posted yet. So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.

I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble.

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

3.) Edward Jones account

My questions are as follows:

1.) Do they withhold taxes at the time of the withdrawal from 401k and Ed Jones?

1a.) If so, how much would I have to withdraw to net 50k? I’m in the 24% tax bracket.

2.) One CPA advised against using SDIRA money. I believe it creates a UBIT tax? Not sure what that is but other than that I’m not sure why.

The question I'm grappling with is whether the rezoning effort, which I know can be quite a process, would be worth the potential gains.

1awjtwt,investing,"Confused about rolling over 401k, backdoor Roth and pro-rata rule","Hi all,

I've done some research and searched old posts but haven't found myself grasping the considerations around rolling over my old employer 401k.

Situation is as follows:

I have a Traditional 401(k) at T. Rowe Price from an old employer, balance is around $75k with $65k being contributions and $10k earnings.

The rest of my retirement accounts are at Vanguard, where I have two 401(k)'s from previous employers, a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The Traditional and Roth IRAs at Vanguard are used for backdoor Roth each year, as our income is over the limit for directly contributing to Roth IRA.

My goal is to simplify life by moving the 401(k) to Vanguard. As best I can tell, I'm paying $36/yr in fees to T. Rowe Price at the moment. I am currently not employed and so do not have an active employer 401(k) that could accept the rollover from T. Rowe Price 401(k).

I have read that high income earners should not rollover a 401(k) to a Traditional IRA because of the IRS pro-rata rule impacting backdoor Roth IRA, though I can't say I could explain why that is. However, I do know that I want to continue doing backdoor Roth IRA each year for the next 20 years or so.

I am considering rolling over the T. Rowe Price Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA and taking the income tax hit on the $75k now, in order to get 20+ years of tax-free growth in the years ahead. In this case, would I still run into issues with future backdoor Roth IRA contributions and the IRS pro-rata rule?

TLDR: If I convert a Traditional 401(k) from an old employer to a Roth IRA, will it compromise my ability to do future backdoor Roth IRA contributions?

Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated.

Edit: For the folks commenting that now is good time to do Roth conversion since I am not working, I should have mentioned that my spouse is a high earner and we expect our joint earnings to be at our current income level or higher in future years.",2024-02-21 18:45:45,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617524,5 days 01:44:03.617525,14,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awjtwt/confused_about_rolling_over_401k_backdoor_roth/

1awi9lb,investing,What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",2024-02-21 17:44:41,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617531,5 days 02:45:07.617531,1,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awi9lb/whats_the_role_and_future_of_intel_in_taiwans/
1awhjkz,investing,CNBC Market Coverage Overview,"The trading platform my work uses only has CNBC and no Bloomberg so I’m forced to watch it and here is what I have found. Thought I would share:

Squawk Box: Good show and often has the best guests. Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen are both solid interviewers but polar opposites. Andrew is a bit more liberal while Joe is a bit more conservative, they mix well together and Becky provides a good buffer between the two

Squawk on the Street/Money Movers: Good show but it is basically Cramers show. Carl doesn’t do much other than read a headline and let Jim rant. Faber is mostly a M&A guy and doesn’t provide much when acquisitions are slow (like now). Faber is a bachelor who when asked what his favorite part about being on CNBC said is that he gets to go to Saks and pick out suits and CNBC pays for it all. After the first hour, Sara Eisen replaces Jim. And stays on until Wapner and Halftime. Sara is very meh, not great but not awful. While Jim is very focused on individual stocks, Sara is more macro and provides some decent color. You’ll see a lot of good interviews during these times but it’s mostly just CEO’s talking up their companies or activists/short sellers just advertising their positions so be weary.


Jim Cramer: Ok Cramer gets his own section for obvious reasons. A lot of people give Cramer a hard time but I like the guy and think he truly means well and wants to help people. The thing is, is that when you spend years talking about stocks all day, you’re going to be wrong sometimes and he has been wrong and people seem to amplify them and forget about his winners. Nevertheless, the guy is clearly smart (Harvard, Goldman, Hedge Fund) and super well connected and gets great CEOs and guests on Squawk (and Mad Money) despite often asking really tough and direct questions. He is also funny and is able to provide you a good Birds Eye view of companies that are trending that you would otherwise not care about. People say he only talks about stocks he owns and that is true but on purpose as that is what his whole hedge fund strategy was built on before he went on TV. The guy would just talk up stocks he owned to analysts in the 90s and those analysts would talk about the stock, causing people to flock in and the price to rise. Overall, I think Cramer gets a bad rap given what he provides, that’s not to say he is perfect or to take anything he says to your brokerage account but he definitely does not deserve an entire inverse etf

Halftime Report: I usually turn off the sound here as this segment can get annoying. Wapner is alright and can often challenge the guests but it’s hard to tell if I like him as the guests are just abysmal. Most of the guests just like to hear themselves talk. Josh Brown thinks he is Warren Buffet and Scott will never challenge him. Joe T has an etf. If you didn’t know, dont worry, he will mention it multiple times. Stephanie Link just never stops talking. Some of the other guests are good but they can never get a word in because those three love to talk and Scott never interrupts them. Overall, the segment is very foggy as many of the guests are trying to sell themselves/the funds or companies they work for so it can be hard to take anything away from what they say without a large grain of salt that they have other motives for advertising their positions

Power Lunch: I really like this segment as both Kelly and Tyler are laidback and not too serious. No good guests but you often see a lot of interesting stories that aren’t as widely covered. Not much to this part but a good listen as the trading day winds down

Closing Bell: Another solid segment as Scott is good here and the guests are often solid. Nothing too exciting but a good end of the day wrap up.

I usually turn it off after closing bell so can’t provide much color after that but thought I would share my two sense on CNBC market coverage throughout the trading day",2024-02-21 17:16:35,2024-02-26 20:29:48.617534,5 days 03:13:13.617535,8,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awhjkz/cnbc_market_coverage_overview/

1aweeqt,investing,"If the best strategy to make money is to buy and hold an index fund, who is keeping the market “efficient”?","I always hear that actively managed funds (and individuals) fail to beat indexes such as the S&P 500. If this is the case, how does the market stay efficient when instead of needing to research companies based on their fundamentals, capital just flows into the top 500 companies with no regard to whether or not they are actually good companies?

It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:

1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.

2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies. 

Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes. 

If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of “you can’t beat the market” is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.

1awbqfp,investing,"Reddit Plans to Reserve Shares for Its Big Users in IPO, WSJ Reports","Social media platform Reddit plans to sell a chunk of its IPO shares to its platform's users, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  
It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.  
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.  
Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.  
The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.  
Reddit's IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest's debut in 2019.

I've been investing in the QDVE ETF, which focuses on S&P500 technology companies, for about a year. My interest in technology and its potential drove me to this ETF, and so far, I've been pleased with its performance. However, I'm aware of the risks, especially with a sector-focused investment like this.  
I'm seeking insights into the specific risks associated with a technology-focused ETF like QDVE, as well as any ETF in general. I understand that markets can fluctuate and sectors can underperform, but I'm particularly interested in the factors that could lead to a downturn in this type of ETF. Also, I'd like to understand more about how the holdings are managed. For instance, QDVE has significant portions in companies like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. If a company like NVIDIA were to perform poorly, how would the portfolio manager handle this? Can they adjust the holdings to keep the ETF stable, and if so, how does this process typically work?  
Any advice on mitigating these risks and protecting my investment, as well as insights into the management of ETF holdings, would be greatly appreciated.

1aw9mx8,investing,Roth IRA for my retired parents.,"Hello,  
I've been helping my parents invest properly this past year, sadly they have only been using savings accounts and CDs to store/grow their wealth.

  
My parents are retired (no jobs) and currently live off my father's disability payments (army veteran) and both there's social security.

  
I recently discovered that money earned from disability can be contributed to his Roth IRA (just opened) so I plan to fund it with $7,000 for this year. As for my mother would we be able to contribute another $7,000 in my fathers IRA since they file taxes jointly. This would be $14,000 total contributed into my father IRA for this year, is this okay since they file taxes jointly?

  
I'd also like to know if he'd able to swing trade equities within this account tax free or should this be only used for long-term investments.

If you are in this situation, what did you do? Buying year to year seems like a bad strategy if you have cash on hand because if it keeps going up, you are just paying more for it next year. Of course it could be heading for a cliff and when a company is large enough, you hardly have any better perspective on its future prospects than when looking at a public company (unless you are really high up).

1aw6pkf,investing,Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player,"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.

So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.

Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

Strategy:

So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.

(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)

Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.

I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.

Financials and Macro:

So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -

These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.

A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.

So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.

Now to their Balance Sheet: They have

around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.

Market Cap: 5.17 Billion

So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.

Risks:

The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H & M and less from Fashion Brands.

Of course many people would also think, that amazon will just also take the fashion e-commercemarket very easily, however i think, that people want a special place for buying their brand clothes and don't want to search bar for their product of choice. More and more of the sales will be impuls sales, with the customers scrolling through the app at a busstop and just buying something that they like, which is not possible with amazon, due to their big supply of many other things, than brand clothing.

Another risk is, that the macro enviroment right now is much worse and the DACH Market where around 45 % of their revenue lies, is growing a bit slower than the 8 % Cagr in Europe. Even though this is possible, their DACH-Market already is very profitable, with a 6 % operating margin despite the way lower gross margin, so the very likely higher growth rate in their rest of europe department could lead to higher Operating margins here, due to more growth and the operating leverage, that comes with it.

So i think most of the European e-commerce stocks are really undervalued and even though we won't see the growth rates from the covid e-commerce hype, these buisnesses will still grow at very decent rates and should further improve their profitability, which makes Zalando in my opinion a good investment.",2024-02-21 08:00:45,2024-02-26 20:29:49.696320,5 days 12:29:04.696321,3,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/
1aw560f,investing,How to save to retire early? Would you start saving to retire early even if you enjoy the work or would you keep grinding?,"Main question is how to properly save for early retirement? Also what would you do In my shoes?

Long story short I worked my ass off and have been quite lucky. I have an accountant and I'll talk with him more about this when I go do my taxes as well but I'm mid 20s and have a business with 5 employees.

I take a salary of 70k. I work a ton so the math on the hours isn't great but I'm frugal and for now enjoy the work. Anyway it's all under an LLC right now and after all the business expenses are taken care of I'm still having about 12-15k a month left over. Currently my business account has a bit too much cash just sitting there.The business is in construction and while I don't want to scale this much more I have thought about branching out, outright building houses. Coupled with this I could take my lifestyle up a notch or two. Like I said not flashy but I do think I'd enjoy traveling more and traveling rich(er).

Or I up my salary start investing tons of money and retire early. Like forties. I could probably hire someone to run day to day but the hours are crazy bouncing between jobs and would realistically need 2 people. So it'd cost me a lot more than the 70k I pay myself. Would need a good nestegg saved up. 

What would you do? Right now leaning towards a soft retirement in my late 30s early 40s. Would hire someone to share the load of management but would still work some. If i start saving to retire early any pitfalls I should be aware of? Currently just have a Roth I'm contributing the max to which is all mutual funds and an account with about 50k in single stocks (thanks Nvidia lol). Also have like 12k in crypto.

And before anyone says anything I pay my guys well above market rate and give good bonuses I just got really lucky with some long term contracts (who you know who you blow).

It’s supposed to be “aggressive” at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that’s what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don’t understand why TDF’s are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren’t we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn’t maybe read the room and see we’re in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?

I’m going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.   

I know TDF’s are popular here but I just don’t understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don’t think I’m ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that’s a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF’s inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.

For one month in 2023, specifically November, I received $102 substitute payment in lieu of dividends from pff. The only scenario I can fathom for receiving substitute payments is securities lending, but I've been opted out of securities lending because of the disparity in taxation. 

I reached out to sofi and their cs agent wrote: ""it appears that on 11/7 pff paid out a substitute payment in lieu of dividend."" This answer makes no sense to me and as I said, I've never heard of substitute payments except where a broker has lent out an account-holder's shares.

I first start by allocating 80% of my funds into a world index such as VWRL. I then allocate 10% to individual stocks, these are stocks in sectors I’m interested in/use and confident in. The sectors I’m interested in are technology, financial services, aviation and some other businesses where I like their business model such as McDonald’s and Costco.

Then right on cue my brokerage sent me an email around custodial brokerage accounts. IMO at first glance they feel like a better value than having money sitting in checking. I was thinking while hes a baby whenever we buy him a toy or anything like that we put some money into the company we're buying from.

As he gets older i let him manage some trades to help teach him the value of investing.

* Each position is equal weight.

* I can only pick from the tech stocks listed below because of specific screening requirements.

Other considerations:

* I am clearly overweight tech. I am a big believer in tech outperforming in the long run. 

* I will be creating/investing in this portfolio with M1 finance, meaning I can create pies/ETFs with up to 100 stocks per pie/ETF. I can theoretically include as many tech stocks as I want and include that pie/ETF as a percentage of the overall portfolio.

1avl95c,investing,Why did the market think the Fed would cut rates this year?,"I'm wondering if there's a logistical reason to why the market tried to call the Federal Reserve's bluff to rate cuts this year? 

&#x200B;

I'm unsure why the market would just go about and assume that rate cuts ""had to happen"" and price in 7 rate cuts, when the fact is this is an election year. The Federal Reserve claims to have no part in our political system, so I don't understand why they would want to give any perceptions or assumptions of anything going on until after the election in November is finished? 

&#x200B;

To me it seems pretty clear cut that unless something breaks significantly (large bank failures such as JP Morgan or Capital One or Wells Fargo, etc) - that there is no reason to lower interest rates until after the election. Inflation is still a big question. YoY CPI is around 3% but inflation is still 20-25% since 2020. The economy is ""booming"" if you take the jobs reports to be truthful. And in may ways if we find out the jobs numbers are lies, the market could react by having a huge surge which would cause more inflation. 

  
Europe and China are in recession, but that's no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the U.S. Like Bloomberg said all of last year - we have a case of American Exceptionalism here. 

&#x200B;

I think the stock market at best will be flat all year while people start to realize those rate cuts are not happening. Next year we may have a crash after the election is decided when they cut rates and it creates the ""perception"" that something is broken, even if nothing is ""broken,"" per-se.",2024-02-20 16:06:13,2024-02-26 20:29:49.696353,6 days 04:23:36.696353,110,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1avl95c/why_did_the_market_think_the_fed_would_cut_rates/

1avf8au,investing,Sense check on savings account choices for a down payment,"New to this (be gentle 😘 ) so please lmk if my research below tracks. I've hopefully done most of the legwork. I am shopping for a savings product to stash a down payment. Savings window is probably a few years. I am currently in the Fidelity (brokerage), BOA (checking/Merrill Lynch brokerage), and American Express (card) ecosystems, and would prefer to stay there for my sanity, but y'know. 

Leading candidates are:

* FDLXX (doesn't accrue state/local tax?), currently at 4.94% w/ a .42% ER   

* BOA’s preferred deposit currently at 4.92%  


Seems like BOA PD’s is better for my situation:   
•	Looking at the cons: $100k entry is fine for me, 5 days or however much to withdraw is fine, clunkiness is a bummer but comparable to having to transfer from Fidelity to BOA anyway. I'd have to pay fed and state income taxes on the yield, vs. FDLXX paying fed gains and fed income taxes, and gains are both a lower rate and less likely to happen, which is a bummer. 9.3% CA tax on income means BOA’s rate is more like 4.46%.  
•	Pros: But BOA PD is easier to access in BOA ecosystem, counts toward preferred rewards, and avoids FDLXX's .42% MER which makes its yield more like 4.5% - whatever minimal gains. Do MMFs even make gains? Plus HYSA’s historically bottom out around 1% and often reach the 2s, while MMFs were \~0 in 2015, 16, 20, 21. Obviously you can move the money, but this is set and forget value.

1. I use the Robinhood account strictly for ETFs only. Currently contributing $2,000 a month..
2. I use the WeBull Account strictly for Individual Stocks only. Currently Contributing $500 a month. I purchase fractional shares for every $500 split between 14 different stocks. I do this to maintain an 80/20 ratio between ETFs and Stocks.
3. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA account and buy ETFs only. Any dividends received from the Robinhood and WeBull accounts will go to the Roth IRA to help achieve the annual contribution limit.
4. My company contributes a percentage of my earnings during their fiscal year. I calculated their annual contribution to average a minimum of $580 a month to my Pre-Tax 401(k). Their match is tied to my earnings during their fiscal year so I expect my company's monthly contribution to increase by a few dollars every year.

Alternatively I could buy longer term bonds like 10Y, get a lower yield (4.2%), but expect to make capital gains and sell when the rates are cut. Risk is rates going up more because i’m stuck with lower bond prices and locked in for 10 years, but that would be suicidal for the economy.

questions:
1. If rates are cut, shouldn’t the short term bond price also increase?
2. What am i missing in terms of risks here?
3. Which option is more suited for this emergency fund situation?",2024-02-20 00:05:03,2024-02-26 20:29:49.696378,6 days 20:24:46.696378,23,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1av375l/inverted_curve_long_or_short_term_bonds/

HYSA you pay interest which is at income rate.   
Brokerage you pay short term on dividends and long term if you sell it after a year

Understand that no one here is giving me official advice I'm just gonna lay out my logic and would appreciate some guidance or other things to consider before potentially abandoning the idea completely or taking the next official step and setting up a consultation (either tradersaccounting or greeentrader, any others you suggest?).

Quick rundown, I have a normal day job w/access to health insurance and a 401k and also fund a roth IRA. I use IBKR and about 85% of my trading (about 3-4 round trips/month) is futures trades with the other 15% being options and etfs. 

So I DO NOT qualify anywhere near the 720 trades a year to make it to TTS status and if I understand that is the ONLY way I could look at writing off various legitimate trading expenses (home office, internet, etc.). 

I do beleive however if I do some sort of business for trading I may be able to get access to other retirement accounts (sep IRa?) that I may be able to shuttle more tax advantaged money tothus shortening my retirement timeline (not getting around minimum age but hope to be more ""ready"" by then). I don't know what other things could actually be considered a write off, you hear the joke about talking about ""business"" over lunch it has now become a tax write-off, not looking to do anything not legitimate but seems there are some advantages out there the average person can't do not owning a business. 

So far the main drawbacks I have seen from my research is potentially paying professional data fees (I use IBKR). 

So can someone help me think through if there is any benefit or is it a lost cause.. oh let's not forget the best ""pro"" of all to owning a business is getting that sweet restaurant depot membership!

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

Or if there's another platform that is better than all three, I'd be keen to hear about it.

2. Is my percentage of gain / loss because a small % of my portfolio is actually invested? I only have about $3700 invested and 10,000 in a HYSA. So portfolio wise I’m not up a bunch but individual ETFs I’m up around 20%? (QQQ is around +14% & SCHD is +6%)

Berkshire make their money off of dividends and profits from their investments and companies they actually own.

1ate4w0,investing,Advice on ways to grow NW beyond just investing taxable brokerage accounts? ,"I just posted my NW here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/s/Bv0P91fuL4 

What I am looking for is advice on any other ways to grow retirement non taxable accounts?? I have learned a lot from reddit and while I am seeking Financial advisors, I want to be informed independently too. 

For several reasons I am quite behind on my 401k value as it should be per my age (been contributing since 2010.)

Mistakes I think I made:

1. Started contributing late. Missed out on 3 years of contribution into 401k

2. Didnt max out 401k contribution until 2-3 yrs ago. Was contributing around 6% or so. Match was 1.5% for many years. 

3. Stopped contributing to Roth as I was above income limits starting 2017. Didnt take advantage of backdoor etc

4. Didnt reinvest dividends in non taxable accounts. (All reinvested now.)

5. Didnt take advantage of HSA.

6. Lost NW from Divorce. (No pre nup)

7. Didnt take advantage of additional contribution from my company for certain employees. ( a company benefit I missed out on).

What I am doing now:

1. Fully maxed out on 401k

2. Working through backdoor/megabackdoor to start the roth contributions each year.

3. Currently investing in Tbills (moved away from CDs) for tax reasons. (Laddered Tbills 6 months and a year). Doubt i”ll have this option in the future.

4. In 8 yrs when I am 50 and if the law still allows then I”ll take advantage of  the catch up contribution but its not much. 

No HSA available to me. 

My Question - What else can I do to grow my non taxable account value? 

Is all my NW going to come from taxable accounts? With high CA taxes, lawyer fees each year (hoping it will be resolved next by end of year) and forced to put house purchase on hold I dont know what else to do other than start really cutting on expenses to Grow my savings.

NW: ~ 1M; break down is as follows:

1. 290k in brokerage account

2. 200k Tbills

3. 100k HYSA which is my EF

4. 200k 401k, TiRA and Roth

5. 210k in RSUs vested

HHI: 600k depending on stock price.

(Car loan is already deducted from the liquid assets I have. No CC debt as its paid off every month. I Invest 1000 per month in stocks since last 2 yrs - had a gap of 3-4 months due to large expenses. Saving 5-10% each paycheck into HYsA.) 

Everything currently points to just building and growing my taxable assets - brokerage, HYSA and perhaps in the future rental / primary property.

1at0rcx,investing,My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!,"**UPDATE:  The money was finally moved to her IRA after complaining up the chain of command.  But read forward to understand how crazy 401K to IRA Rollovers can be.**

My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check.

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

I noticed the main challenges are:  


* **Finding out if the startup/business is real (due diligence)**: Like I don't know if their revenue is accurate or how many active users/customers they have
* **Tracking their investments**: If you've invested $25k in each startup, how can you track them? Bth the financial amount and the startup's progress
* **Exiting sooner than a liquidity event**: Is it possible to transfer your shares you got as an angel investor sooner than a liquidity event (e.g. another funding round) by the startup? Like sell your shares to another investor or exchange them for another startup lol
* **People just assume you're rich by default**: Noticed in some events when someone says I'm an angel investor, founders rush into them asking for >$100k. Is that normal?

1asbqw2,investing,Buy high or find something else?,"Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

TL:DR
I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

""When is it too late to jump on the train?""

It looks like the recessions we are having today will be more and more sectorial/industrial than global.  
What i mean by that is that if a sector or industry is having a layoffs, drop in sales or a recession than it would impact mostly that industry while other industries will keep on their same trajectory.

A bunch of very speculative companies were revealed in a filing yesterday to have stakes. Many already known, but curious if this seems like something dubious to others, if you're essentially dumping money into companies so that those companies will turn around and spend all the money on GPUs. On the flip side, it does make sense that if one or more of these startups take off, they'll be creating organic demand for Nvidia products.

1. Regulatory Dichotomy: The U.S. presents a regulatory mosaic, with state and federal laws creating a complex tapestry of driving regulations. Conversely, China operates under a unified federal system, spearheaded by Xi Jinping, an unchallenged architect of policy.  
2. Autonomous Ambitions: This contrast in governance models suggests a divergent path toward the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The U.S., with its regulatory labyrinth, might find itself trailing, whereas China's streamlined approach positions it at the forefront, potentially accelerating Chinese dominance in the autonomous vehicle sector through invaluable real-world data accumulation.  
3. Economic Transitions: Yet, the broader economic canvas reveals China amidst a seismic shift from a manufacturing behemoth to a service-oriented giant. This transition, fraught with volatility, casts a shadow over the Chinese stock market, hinting at protracted growing pains that could extend into the Year of the Horse (2027), as growth rates recalibrate from explosive to sustainable.

I'm sure you've seen the latest update on the Fear and Greed Index indicating extreme greed.

There are some warning signs that the economy is slowing down, such as:

- The real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which measures the change in the unemployment rate, is at 0.2%, which is close to the threshold of 0.5% that signals the start of a recession
- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index, which tracks 10 indicators of future economic activity, declined by 0.1% in December 2023, the first drop since April 2020.
- The OECD Composite Leading Indicator, which covers 37 countries and regions, fell by 0.1 point to 99.6 in November 2023, the lowest level since June 2020.

1arpw2b,investing,CZR - Caesars Entertainment 'Research',"Was in Las Vegas February 7-13, 2024. Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

1aro8ij,investing,"No load, no fee money-market Mutual Funds with minimums > $1 but less than $1M?","I currently put some cash in the mutual fund SNOXX, short-term, because it gets over 5% interest. It has a $1 minimum investment which is super convenient for using for ""loose ends"" in a brokerage account. It yields a heck of a lot more than most cash sweeps, and is only slightly less flexible because I can get the money out of it by the end of the day and then trade with it a couple days later at the latest. Unlike savings accounts there is no transaction limit per month so it's perfect for temporary money storage, and rebalancing purposes in a portfolio.

I notice that there are also funds that are similar, but have minimum balances of $1M, which, understandably, yield a bit more (often as much as 0.25% more), probably because of lower expense ratios because they have fewer little transactions. I have nowhere near this level of cash.

However, I would love to find something intermediate between it and these higher-yield, higher-minimum-balance ones. I don't particularly need the full flexibility of the $1 minimum balance nor do I really need to be able to trade in $1 increments.

Like if I'm buying / selling in increments of $100, $1,000, or $10,000, but am nowhere near the $1M mark, is there any way to squeeze another 0.05% or 0.1% or so return, out of some similar mutual fund that has the same basic flexibility?

Parents have a portfolio worth around 4.5M. Dad is early 70s earning \~250K/year and will work another 1-8 years (he would like to work as long as he can, but taking into account uncertainty). Mom late 60s, doesn’t work. Total expenses around 100-120K/year, no one is sick yet. Risk averse people.They pay advisor .75% fee, with 20% in money market, 75% bonds, 5% VTSAX bringing their total expense ratio to around 1%. Comes to around 40K/year in fees (they hold some money in their own checking account). However, when my mom asked him how much they were paying, he brushed it off and said something vague about a monthly cost without giving specifics. He also allowed them to sell in 2020, never get back into the market, and their total net worth has been the same for 4 years (so losing because of inflation). Parents not financially literate at all. I figured if they have almost all their money in cash/fixed income, but still insist on having an advisor, Facet (all fiduciaries) can do that for a quoted 5-6K/year, plus expense ratio around .1%. 6-8K/year tops, and they can keep everything in fixed income.  That would save them about $30K/year in cost. Facet claims to have a HYSA at 5.3% right now, and they can keep a primarily-fixed income plan but save a ton of money.Thoughts on this plan/Facet?

Why I don't trust him as their advisor:

\- When asked how much they pay a year, he said they are ""billed monthly"" and didn't give an actual number

\- Did not make clear to parents that they had to expense ratios into account - they genuinely thought they were just paying .75%.

\- He's an MBA and Registered Agent, but NOT a CFP

\- He constantly talks about his family and comes across as a greaseball who is blatantly trying to develop the ""emotional connection"" these guys are undoubtedly encouraged to do.

\- He told me he'd set me up with a portfolio that would put me ""in the millions"" in regard to my Roth IRA (while technically eventually true... just sleezy).

\- Facet \*seems\* to be great because they are flat-flee fiduciaries and my parents portfolio - while complex in some ways - isn't rocket science to a solid advisor.",2024-02-15 19:10:21,2024-02-26 20:29:50.748768,11 days 01:19:29.748768,53,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arndnn/parents_getting_screwed_by_their_advisor_try_facet/

So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible. 

Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?

Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies?

1argxca,investing,Interest rate for loaning money to flip houses.,"I have a guy that flips houses and sells them for a profit. He does multiple houses at a time. He buys the houses with cash offers  and flips them and then sells them for a profit. He gets the money for this from private lenders like myself and not banks. I’ve been doing this with him for 7 years or so. Everything has gone well. My question is he gives me 10% per annual interest for borrowing the money. So if I loan him $300,000 you multiply that by .10 and divide that by 12 (months) therefor he gives me $2,500.00 a month. He usually gives the capital back anywhere from 3-6 months. All of his work is insured and contracts are done to protect me and all that good stuff.

My question is does anybody else do this? Is 10% a good rate for me or could I get more? I had a different guy that wanted to do something similar and he heard I got 10% and so he said he would give me 11% just to get me to switch. The big difference is he wants me to sign a 5 year contract with my money. He also mentioned how it usually works is the longer the loan the lower the interest rate. Which got me thinking that I should be getting more than 10% with the original guy maybe.

  
Edit: A lot of comments about how I am not protected. The contracts I sign protect me. At all times I have ownership of the house. The county appraisal district has my name and only my name under ownership. If he misses a payment or goes bankrupt I have the house to sell to make my money back. Everything is fully insured.

A few years ago, I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/cnjhgt/23yo_started_working_full_time_looking_to_start/) about the beginning of my investing journey and [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/k02lkl/my_first_year_as_an_investor/) after my first year as an investor. Currently, I am 27 years old and have been investing for about five years. This is an update on my current situation: I worked as an IT/Business consultant for my first employer for three years, and now I am a data analyst consultant at a new job. My current salary looks like this:

* \~€2650 net
* \~€160 meal vouchers
* Company car & fuel card
* Pension savings ('Group insurance') to which \~€130 is added each month
* The 'usual' (insurance, holiday pay, 13th month, ...)



Since the last posts, my investment portfolio changed quite a lot. The total amount at the time of writing is hovering around **€149.000**:

* ETFs: Invested €33.000, now it is worth €44.000+
* Cryptocurrencies: Invested €5000, now it is worth €45.000
* Cash: €10.000
* Retirement funds: €4.000+
* Personal Companies: \~€35.000
   * Used €30.000 to start a small **real estate company** with 2 friends. We've done 2 projects since (flipping 2 apartments) but I'm still waiting on the final year overview from the accountant to update the €30.000 to the actual value right now.
   * The other €5.000 was invested in a business I recently took over together with my girlfriend. This business is a **fry shop** (called 'frituur' in Dutch) which is now running for a little over a month. Of course, we took a loan from the bank as well. It is still too early to update the value of this company.
* Real Estate: \~€30.000 in equity. This is the building that we bought together with the 'frituur' business mentioned above. We are in the process of renovating the apartment on the first floor so we can actually live there as well in a couple of months.
* A personal loan from my parents - €20.000. I took this out the finance the real estate that we bought. In this way, I didn't have to sell any investments.

1ard9in,investing,Rebalancing my portfolio and changing positions,Hey guys I have a question. I moved about 250k from a brokerage account at northwestern mutual to fidelity (tired of the fees and want to take back control of my finances). I want to completely change my holdings and I spoke to a fidelity broker and he said the only way to do this was to sell all my current holdings and buy the new positions I want.

1arbdre,investing,How I analyze stocks for the long-term: Framework walkthrough,"I wrote a post a few days back on why we should *learn* to analyze individual stocks, even if you choose to invest most of your money in index funds/ETFs. You can read the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1amihwf/why_you_should_learn_to_invest_in_individual/).

In this post, I will share the process I have been using to analyze individual stocks. It requires fair bit of work and thinking, but it’s worth the effort for the clarity I get.

When we buy a stock, we are buying piece of a business. By asking a series of structured questions, I try to understand how the underlying business works, predict what it will be like in a few years, and estimate a reasonable price for buying it whole.

I don’t want to spent weeks and months doing complex analysis and financial modeling like institutional investors. My goal is to do simple evaluation of publicly traded companies by putting in reasonable effort to arrive at a conclusion that makes sense for me as an the individual investor.

Even though I only intend to buy few stocks, I think that I will be buying the whole business and keep it for many years. And to figure out if I want to purchase it, I try to answer these six questions:

1. **What does the business do?**
2. **Is it a good business?**
3. **If it’s a good business, why is it good?**
4. **Can it remain a good business in future too?**
5. **Is it run by competent and honest people?**
6. **Is it available at a fair price?**

Let’s take a hypothetical example to illustrate how this investing framework can be applied. Imagine that a popular sandwich store in our neighborhood just became available for sale. We have money in bank and are seriously considering buying it. I will try to answer these questions in order (We will skip management analysis in this example as it’s more applicable for public companies)

**1. What does this business do?** We want to figure out how does this business work and make money. There are four main things to understand:

* What does the business sell? *(sandwiches, drinks, cookies)*
* Who are the customers? *(locals vs tourists, old vs young, rich vs poor)*
* How does it sell its products and services? *(what are the channels: in-store vs online orders vs group catering)*
* What are its costs? *(ingredients, labor, rent, marketing)*

**2. Is it a good business?** Once we have a decent understanding of how the business works, we want to look at its health. More specifically,

* Does it have a clean balance sheet? *(is it loaded up with debt? And how much assets the store owns?)*
* What are the sales of the store? *(revenue from sale of food and drinks)*
* What are the profit margins like? *(gross profit and net profit)*
* How much cash does the store generates? *(operating cash and free cash flow)*
* What’s the return on invested capital? *(Am I better off just buying risk-free bonds?)*
* How have these numbers grown or declined in last few years? How does these numbers compare to industry average and other similar food joints?

**3. What makes it a good business?** So far if we think it’s a good business, we now want to understand why is it so and how it stands out from competition.

* Who are its competitors? *(local joints, larger chains, other eateries)*
* Does it have a competitive advantage or a “moat” *(hard to have moats in food industry for local stores, but few have a strong brand)*
* Why do customers keep coming back to this place? Or will they keep paying even when we raise prices?

**4. Will it continue to be a good business in future?** This is where we need to think strategically about future, especially about three aspects:

* Is the company’s moat durable? *(If the owner or chef leaves, will the business tank? What can harm the brand?)*
* What are the main risks the business face? *(What if key suppliers go out of business or increase prices? Can changing customer preferences towards healthier foods impact sales?)*
* What are the biggest opportunities? *(is there potential for expanding store locations, increasing menu items, hiking prices, or cutting costs)*

**5. Is the business available at a fair price?** Now we bring it all together and assess if the current offer price is reasonable or too high. This needs a bit of number crunching, but we will avoid complex projections on heavy excel sheets.

* What drives earning growth? *(economy in general, influx of residents, inflation?)*
* How would the earnings grow in next few years? *(Future is uncertain and probabilistic so we need to think of worst, likely, and best case scenarios)*
* What would be the value of this business after a few years? *(what kind of multiple it is available today on earnings or sales? what will be a reasonable multiple in future?)*
* Will I loose a lot of money if things go wrong? *(Is there some margin of safety in price I am paying)*
* Given all this, what’s a price that I am happy to pay today? *(One that will meet my return expectations at risk I am comfortable with)*
* If the asking price is higher or lower than my happy price, why is that the case? *(Do I understand why owner is asking for lower price or why market is valuing it lower? What am I missing?)*

After I have good enough answers to these questions, I will put pen to paper and summarize my thinking in a crisp 1-pager. This will becomes my investing thesis and guide me to make a buy or pass decision. This is exactly the same process we can follow for analyzing any publicly listed company.

For every dozen or so 1-pagers I have write, I will *maybe* invest in one. Sometimes I won’t understand the business well enough and other times I won’t like the price. But that's okay! I know that I have done the hard part already. I will keep the stock in my watchlist, move on to the next stock, and update the analysis from time to time if I liked the business.

As you can imagine, this is simple but not easy. It’s not for everyone. But it is very satisfying and intellectually stimulating. And like every other skill, it gets easier with practice.

That's it! That's the process I use. I would love to hear you feedback on how I can improve on this. Also, if this is interesting, I can write few posts on diving deeper into each of these sub-parts with an example of a public stock.",2024-02-15 09:06:55,2024-02-26 20:29:50.748822,11 days 11:22:55.748822,8,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arbdre/how_i_analyze_stocks_for_the_longterm_framework/

From MarketWatch:

> Wall Street fund managers are now extremely bullish, the closely watched BofA Fund Manager survey revealed. Fund managers have slashed their holdings in cash and Treasury bills to low levels: At an average of 4.2% of assets, cash levels are now down about a third since October, **and are a whisper from the 4% level that BofA, historically, considers an automatic sell warning**[my Reddit emphasis added]. Meanwhile, fund managers are now more heavily invested in U.S. stocks than at any time since November 2021

That is the paragraph that got my attention. First, I don’t think I’d ever seen that stat before. % cash if surveyed fund mgrs 

I can’t say it’s alarming. (And I took out a few adjectives and adverbs that made the article more sensational.) it depends on how smart you think fund mgrs are.

The author says than when the fund managers are soft on an industry, there are often good buys, because they are value priced based on the fund managers avoiding them. Of course, they *could* be avoiding sectors for good reasons. 

It’s questionable whether the fund managers are knowledgeable or not. But what is without question is wherever they go, they’re going to raise asset prices. Because they’re in command of so much money. It’s like the ETF principle. Or being added to the S&P 500.

So this is also what the report showed:

> Right now, fund managers are heavily invested in U.S. stocks and in bonds. Their most popular sectors are technology, communication services, and pharmaceuticals. Outside of the U.S., they are also big on Japanese equities

> Their least favorite sectors are energy, materials, banks and utilities. Their least favorite regions are Europe (especially London, but actually the whole continent) and emerging markets.

Where there are avoiding seems pretty reasonable and rational. Banks are completely in the air, while the fed tries to make up its mind. 

I’m surprised they are in Bonds at this time, but it doesn’t really say how much or what kind. Pharma is also surprising. I’ve been looking at AstraZeneca for a long ass time now and every time I take a half step toward buying some, it tanks. Which reminds me that I don’t understand the industry very well.

So a lot of money that was on the sidelines, as of last October, is in the market and it’s focused on tech, communications, pharma. And you can see the first two definitely being pushed, as if it needed any help. But I don’t see a whole lot of movement in Pharma unless I’m looking in the wrong places.

But what do you think it says about fund managers being optimistic and invested with both feet?",2024-02-14 21:33:41,2024-02-26 20:29:50.748865,11 days 22:56:09.748866,10,0.53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aqyg44/want_to_chase_the_stockmarket_rally_read_this/

1aqlm34,investing,Exploring a Potential SPA Center/Hotel Project in Partnership with Local Government,"Hi everyone,  
  
I'm reaching out to this community because of a unique opportunity that has caught my attention. A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  
  
**A Bit About Me:**  
My current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  
  
**The Opportunity:**  
When I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel — a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation — is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.

* **What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**  **Interest and Viability**: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring? Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.  
* **Building a Team:** Regarding team assembly, I have already started to consider involving locals who have a proven track record of successfully establishing SPA hotels. The idea is to tap into the wealth of experience right here in our community, leveraging their insights and expertise to ensure the success of this new venture. 
* **Funding and Investment:** One of the most crucial aspects – I don't currently have the funding to bring this project to life on my own. How do you approach finding and securing funding for such an endeavor? Are there investors out there who might be interested in a wellness-focused project like this? I'm keen to explore all avenues for outside investment, whether it's through traditional financing, venture capital, or crowdfunding. 
* **Your Thoughts and Suggestions:** I'm open to any insights, suggestions, or advice you might have. Whether it's about potential challenges, funding strategies, or tips for success, I'm all ears.

1aqcmj1,investing,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue. And what about the Broker Check stuff and doing everything under a major investment bank?

1apzguj,investing,Pagaya (PGY) is a hidden gem with a lot of potential.,"I own Pagaya $PGY and plan to keep buying up to $1.30 to $1.40. I believe there is tremendous upside left in the stock.  


**These are my reasons to buy:**  


**Pick and Shovel Play** : Pagaya is a Fintech, pick and shovels, AI play providing a platform/software service to commercial lenders like Visa, banks, and even Fintech competitor SoFi Technologies (SOFI). It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors.  


**Low Credit Risk:** Pagaya doesn’t keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance.  


**Recurring Fee Based Business**: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones.  


**Network Model**: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service  


**Switching Costs:** It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal.  
**It has strong capital and institutional Backing:** The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS.  
**Strong pipeline:** Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders.  


**Challenges, weaknesses and threats**  


**Cyclical:** This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages.  
Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn.  


**Barriers to entry are low: F**or example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS.  


**Dilution:** Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%...  


**Valuation**  


Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that’s about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk.  
They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost.  
And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock.  


Sure there are risks, but I believe most of them are already priced in at a low price of $1.13, and the upside could easily be $4 to $5 in a few years.

1apvrs0,investing,Why Not 100% Equities - AQR,"New post from Cliff Asness (link at the bottom). Read the whole thing, but here are a few shortened takeaways.

* I don’t know anyone who thinks a portfolio of stocks and bonds has a higher unconditional expected return than 100% stocks. We prefer a diversified portfolio because we believe it has a higher return for the risk taken, not a higher expected return.

* In general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn’t have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash.

* Rising valuations (since the 1990s) have made equities themselves (and especially the USA vs. ex-USA differential) a very likely overestimation of the future.

* Simply looking at historical results and urging investors to “buy the thing that’s gone up the most over the long term” is not financial analysis, it is finger painting.

tl;dr For the love of god, stop just saying ""buy VT and chill""

1apur6l,investing,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?","Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.   


And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",2024-02-13 14:28:31,2024-02-26 20:29:50.749047,13 days 06:01:19.749047,21,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/

And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. 

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.

At this time their yields seem to be extremely similar with BND sitting at 4.36% SEC Yield and BSV having 4.46% SEC Yield. 

The only risk I can think of is if the FED starts dropping interest rates, causing BND's longer-term bonds locked in at a higher yield being able to hold on the better yields for longer, whereas BSV is going to be more dependent on recent prices?

That being said, I'm actually not sure how BND and BSV (bond ETFs) are managed when it comes to the market selling off bonds and re-allocating to different bonds.

1apgizp,investing,Calculating 2023 State Tax-Exempt Treasury Interest from SGOV,"Last year $SGOV was mentioned a lot in several subs as a way to get a 5% yield without paying state/local tax. This post, is more like a question/guide as I just got my 1099 from Schwab (the broker that i use only to buy SGOV and SWVXX). However, the 1099 DIV did not break down how much $ was exempt from state tax. I'm following [this](https://thefinancebuff.com/state-tax-exempt-treasury-fund-etf.html) guide and hopefully can be useful for other people who bought $SGOV or any other tax exempt ETFs in 2023.

Here is the screenshot of my [1099 DIV](https://ibb.co/5k5fcXF) as you can see its only 1 got box filled, but if i scroll down to the dividend section, you see [2 entries](https://ibb.co/1RzJd1d) with the amount of dividends i received in 2023. So, following the guide that i hyperlinked earlier, i look at % of SGOV which is [96.45%](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/2023-ishares-us-government-source-income-information-stamped.pdf).

Therefore, to calculate how much i put in my taxes on freetaxusa, i would put $230 in box 1, select ""Yes"" on ""Is this a mutual fund that has U.S. Government interest income?"" and on the next page I will put $**219.82884** on the box that says ""Enter the amount of your $230 of ordinary dividends that are from U.S. Government interest:""

The formula I got $219.82884 comes from $227.92 (total dividends i received in 2023 from $SGOV) \* 96.45% (U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\*/% from Treasuries).

1ap50cb,investing,Lithium extraction in USA,"people have asked about lithium lately so I thought I’d post. There is a push by Biden admin to develop local capacity, as China currently dominates the biz. A crash in lithium prices has put many projects on hold. Also, regions are demanding more protection of their natural resources. Brine water is a big source of lithium and evaporation pools had always been common, which can leave layers of toxic chemicals in its wake. New methods, like this article about Utah’s Great Salt Lake, pump water out and filter it, leaving the lake largely in tact.

From Wall Street journal:

https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/great-salt-lake-lithium-startup-lilac-d84c9f76?mod=djem10point

> This summer, a California startup plans to start construction on a project to suck up water from the Great Salt Lake to extract one of its many valuable minerals: lithium

> The effort is one of dozens of projects across the U.S. racing to build up a domestic supply of lithium and other battery minerals, with adoption of electric vehicles expected to boom as part of the country’s transition to cleaner energy. The Biden administration is dedicating billions of dollars to strengthening the U.S. battery supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which dominates the global production of battery minerals.

> The challenge: finding ways to efficiently extract the mineral from rocks and water while minimizing environmental damage.

> “Lithium resources in the U.S. are very large in scale, but the chemistry is very challenging,” said Lilac founder and Chief Executive Dave Snydacker. 

> Briny water is among the most promising resources for lithium in the U.S. Exxon Mobil is drilling for lithium-laden brines deep underground in Arkansas’s Smackover region. Other companies are working to extract lithium from brines in California’s Salton Sea. 

It’s funny that oil companies are getting in on it. One of the major pitfalls of drilling for oil is you often hit saltwater first. And it was hard to dispose of it because it destroys agriculture and there was a lot of it. Like they’re leasing these drilling spots often from ranchers or agricultural areas. if they had a gusher of saltwater without properly containing it, that land would be unable to support much in the way of vegetation because it was contaminated with salt. So what had always been an annoying aspect of oil and gas drilling is trying to be leveraged into a lithium mine. And oil companies got a century or so experience of dealing with it.

1anxzjh,investing,Does anyone have a theory on why electric utilities (like $VPU) have been a lousy investment?,"Does anyone have a theory/understanding as to why electric utilities (or a basket of them like $VPU) have been a lousy investment historically?  
VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%. 
  
Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing & transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium.  
  
Secondly, what about from now into the future? 
AI is going to introduce a step-change function in electricity demand, raising multiple challenges around maintaining the electric grid while at the same time transitioning to cleaner energy. For example, compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest just behind Houston, Texas. [1]  
It is forecasted that by 2027 A.I. servers could use between 85 to 134 terawatt hours (Twh) annually. That's similar to what Argentina consumes annually. [2].

Are we going to see a re-rating of utilities eventually?

So now where do we go? I checked into Fidelity as they have branches around here, and their products from a DIY perspective which I have been doing are amazing - for people like her who don't understand what stocks are, they have target date funds and robo advisor programs - but she does want someone she can talk to in person and that's a big thing for her. They seem to have a minimum cash requirement which we are not at for their Wealth Management (500k) - and they may offer other services from what I have heard if you have 50k or more, but the reviews for local offices here are horrible - 1.5 to 2/5 stars on Google.

&#x200B;

Definitely do want someone who is a fiduciary. But the question is at that point how that works - because if they are independent kind of like CPAs/etc... then how would some random Fiduciary manage the ""keys"" to my wife's 401K plans and IRAs? Would I have to link accounts up and/or give them access to trade on her behalf, or would they basically tell her / us what we should do in terms of investing the money? I'm confused how this would work if the assets are not at the same place as the advisor.

&#x200B;

My biggest fear and I don't want to say this in the wrong way - but since we are DINKs and we won't have kids, that when we get old, our mental health may start to go out like POTUS style. If that happens, we may have a lot of money I would have forgotten how to manage at that age and/or fall victim to scams like many older people do. It's great being young and eager to save fees and DIY right now, but I mean I'm 38. 30 years from now I could have onsets of dementia.

1anlj8w,investing,Question about finding a 403b provider as an individual,"Hello everyone!

I work for a non profit which offers a 403b plan. During the presentation yesterday, they explained we need to find our own 403b provider, open an account, then use a website called OMNI as what sounds like an intermediary to decide how much to contribute and such.

They gave us a list of providers we can choose from. I'm fairly seasoned as an investor and assumed it would be as easy as just opening an IRA but for essentially all of the providers they listed, i'm having trouble finding how to open a 403b as an individual. One of the options was New York Life and when I called, they said they don't even offer 403b plans. Has anyone else run into a situation where you were responsible for opening your own 403b?

1ani22c,investing,Do rent prices go up faster than SP500?,"We all know rent rises faster than wages, but what about SP500?

One of the big cons with renting vs housing is rent prices will always go up while a 30 year fixed stays the same.

But if SP500 goes up faster than rent, and someone does not want to buy a house, wouldn't it just be good to hold SP500 and withdraw yearly to pay for a years worth of rent?

Ex. 24 years old and life expectancy is 75 = \~50 years left, which is about 600 month. 600 months of rent at 2000/mo = $1,200,000 in a lifetime.

If I had 1.2 million in SP500 RIGHT NOW (hypothetically) (and along with other assets), wouldn't it just be alright to rent forever and withdraw from the 1.2 million gradually over time to pay for the rent?

Or is buying a house ALWAYS the way?",2024-02-10 14:54:27,2024-02-26 20:29:51.752385,16 days 05:35:24.752385,274,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ani22c/do_rent_prices_go_up_faster_than_sp500/

> In the April-June quarter, economists now see a 23.9% chance of a negative quarter of GDP growth, down from 40.2%. For the last two quarters of the year, the odds are now about 25%, down from above 24% in the prior survey.

> The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s Survey of Professional Forecasters predict the economy will expand at a 2.1% annual rate in the January-March quarter, up from their expectation of 0.8% in the last survey. On an annual average basis, the forecasters expect real GDP to increase 2.4% in 2024. That’s up 0.7 percentage points from the prior survey.

As we know, short positions require more conviction and are more likely to be a made by a sophisticated investor, as they are borrowing money to keep the position open. Research has also shown that investors engaging in short selling typically focus on valuations and fundamentals more than the average investor.

I was wondering if any of you guys use short interest as a metric to value stocks and if you do not, what are you thoughts?

For example: not opening a position on stocks with more than 5% short interest.

I was thinking of backtesting a strategy that goes long bottom quintile and goes short top quintile and i was wondering if it is worth the time.

1amuds8,investing,529 accounts are over rated.,"I’m all for setting some money aside for your kids’ education. But if you do, that money is tied to a singular purpose, and you don’t even know if your kid(s) will need/use it. Use it for something else and you pay a penalty. Furthermore, that tax advantage is almost nonexistent. This is because most people don’t contribute until well after kids are born, so money has limited time to grow - the only tax advantage is on that growth part. (I recognize some states give you a break on state income taxes, but that’s small change and usually this ties you to that state’s funds, which may not make any financial sense.)

Certainly there are use cases where it makes sense - namely if you’re rich and can toss in a huge chunk right when your kid is born. Or if grandparents want to do that early in their grandkids’ lives. But I’d wager for most of us having a 529 makes almost no sense. Open a brokerage account instead.

""Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.

In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips.""

1amk79u,investing,Tax Free Profit Harvesting?,"I’ve looked into the wash sales rules but it doesn’t answer the question I have.

The scenario is, an unemployed person with no other income, had invested in cryptocurrency awhile back and their investment is now at a profit of $150,000. Let’s say their cost basis was $1 for the sake of simple calculations.

Can they, by the end of 2024, sell $47,000 worth of the crypto, all under the 0% tax rate so they’ll pay $0 in taxes.

When 2025 starts, they rebuy $47,000 of the same crypto, and by the end of 2025, sell a other $94,000 worth of crypto. The net profit would be $47,000, again all under 0% tax rate.

Repeat until all investments have a net profit of $0 while still keeping the same holdings.

Is this illegal?

Edit to clarify: The goal is not to cash in profit tax free, but to turn $150,000 in profit into a holding with $150,000 cost basis, tax free. It can take as many years as it needs.

1amform,investing,"For investing in pre-IPO companies, what broker are you investing with? I am with Equityzen but considering to move to another one.","I am investing in pre-IPO companies with a broker Equityzen. When you invest with Equityzen, investments are usually structured as parts of a funds. In other words, Equityzen acquires shares of a pre-IPO company and converts it to a fund and sell it to retail investors. So what you own is a part of a fund that owns shares of a single pre-IPO company.

As you are a LLP (limited liability partnership), Equityzen has a sole discretion whether to participate in a tender offer (i.e., a process of pre-IPO company buying back their shares).

My problem is that Equityzen usually opts in tender offers. Although I made a handsome profit of 200% from tender offers over a couple of years, my expectation is not to step out with such early profit, but to hold them longer until IPO (or being sold to a big company) for a greater profit.

My another concern regarding tender offers is that pre-IPO companies may buy back a large number of shares before going for IPO to maximise the capital inflow. If Equityzen opts in tender offer at such stage, then a risk-to-reward ratio of my pre-IPO investment would be  damaged substantially.

So I am searching for a broker where I can directly own shares.

\- Which brokers are you investing with?

\- When a company goes for IPO (or sold to a bigger company), your broker updates you the news and advise your next step (e.g., how to sell your shares)?

\- does your broker also updates you major news or deal of the company such as tender offers or others?

Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your experience.

Just wanted to get some clarification. So I started a Roth IRA account a while ago. I deposited 6k in 2022 and 6.5k in 2023. I withdrew some money in 2023, then put it back in. I then withdrew 12.5k before 2023 ended because I had read that I can withdraw my contributions tax and penalty free. I still have money in the account, which is my earnings from that 12.5k. 

Do I have to pay taxes if I withdrew the 12.5k contribution? My 1099R only has the gross distribution, about 19k on it, and the box “Taxable Amount” is blank.

Why not instead hold an even lower risk investment, at the moment say cash at 5% and wait for a META like crash or something simular that is very very likely to result in 2x returns, you then have beat the market over the 5 year period with literally one bet? You could split this up between say 3 simular opportunities over a 5 year period, we are talking 40%+ downswings in companies that are near the top of the snp500 and otherwise have a strong outlook.

However I'm coming to the point where I want to buy a home in a year or two, and I'm realizing most of my savings is in retirement accounts and not easily accessible to me. Especially seeing stocks like AAPL and NVDA over the past decade, I'm kicking myself for not investing a good chunk in a few individual stocks a while ago which would have helped me raise a good cash savings today. My options now for raising a downpayment are either withdrawing my Roth IRA contributions, take a loan against my 401k, or saving it slowly the hard way, none of which are ideal. So this is more a warning to young people to not blindly follow advice to max out your retirement accounts, because you may have other short term goals (house, etc.) that come up that may require a chunk of savings to be available.

1al5z6y,investing,Counter party risk when when lending out stocks?,"My broker allows me to opt for the securities lending program. I have done that until know, and got a few thousand from it over time.

At the moment I have a significant position in Gorilla Technologies Group, GRRR. It has a fairly high short interest rate of 280% and the shorts are utilized 100%.

So enabling short lending would earn me a few thousand dollars every month:

But I just checked the regulations, and my broker states:  
'The provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") may not protect you as a   
lender with respect to securities loan transactions in which you lend your Fully-Paid Securities. Therefore, the collateral delivered to you (and indicated on your account statement) may   
constitute the only source of satisfaction of obligation in the event that the broker fails to return the   
securities.'  


So to me that means in the unlikely but possible event of a short squeeze the borrowing party might go belly up. I would then only receive the value of the stocks **before** the squeeze.

1al4igr,investing,The Stigma of Stock Picking,"Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole. 

Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.

Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.

I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest. 

Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red. 

Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.

Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

1akol5d,investing,Thinking of buying Japanese Stock. Can't decide whether to make settled currency in Dollars or Yen,"Hi.  


I asked a similar question a week or so ago, but I think I misunderstood what my brokerage is offering, so I want to see if people here can explain better. I thought having settled currency in Yen was better because it would raise my floor at the risk of lowering my ceiling due to currency fluctuations. But the brokerage person just told me something different (even though another person told me something else a couple of weeks ago when I called).  


So I am thinking of buying Japanese Stock with my US brokerage account. My brokerage account offers settled currency in US Dollars and Japanese Yen.  


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense have settled currency in Dollars or Yen.   


I thought having settled currency in dollars  meant that my investment in the site dashboard would show the Dollar equivalent when it comes to gains/ losses. So for example if the investment in yen went up 20%, but currency fluctuated where the yen got stronger, my actual investment gain in dollar might only be 15%. Whereas if it was in yen, then i would get the full 20% gain, and I only have the currency risk if i choose to convert.  


As my brokerage account is in US, it is probably more convenient to have things in dollars so that if i sell the investment, i don't need to convert to buy something like an ETF?  


Whereas if it is settled in Yen, I would have to convert back? The way the brokerage people told me was that the settled in yen make sense if you have yen in your account. I don't, but I can use the currency exchange feature to get the yen anyways.  


Does it actually matter in terms of potential gains/ losses or other Pros and Cons? The approximate exchange rate is 1 USD to 150 yen.. That is quite lopsided to the US Dollar... I do expect the yen to strengthen even if it is 1 USD to 120 or 130 yen in the future for example.   


TLDR: does it matter if i make my settled currency in Dollar vs Yen in regards to potential gains/ losses?  


Is there any pro or con that I am not aware of in buying in US dollar or Yen?

1akg3bc,investing,Physical silver investment,"I am beginning to allocate a small percentage of my portfolio towards physical silver. Here’s why: 

1. I want to diversify my portfolio beyond cash, stocks and crypto.

2. The gold/silver ratio is at 90. Meaning 90 ounces of silver buys 1 ounce of gold. Historically the average is around 70. Seems like a good time to buy silver.

3. Silver is a hedge against the USD and US financial markets. If we head into a recession, silver typically performs well. 

4. Silver is a non-digital asset. I cannot think of a physical asset that stores value better than silver, other than other precious metals or land / real estate. It has gone from $5 an ounce to $22 an ounce since 1975. It is important to me to own physical assets that will appreciate in value. 

5. It is a solid vehicle for transferring wealth to my children in the future. 

6. It’s shiny! Also, it is fun collecting certain coins if you are willing to pay an extra premium. 

7. Value stems from a myriad of industrial and medical uses.

So I'd like to switch away from RH yet no brokerage I've used so far has had a daily chart like RH. I have tried Fidelity and Schwab but both add deposits to the chart and are very clunky.

Are there any other decent brokerages that do the daily RH style chart and are reputable? It's hard to tell just from looking at their websites so I thought I'd inquire here for some first hand experience.

I'm not day trading, or options trading, or anything fancy. I'm just small time. I do need a place that does fractional shares. So far I prefer Fidelity for this versus Schwab's limitations.

Should I just stick with RH for my ""fun money"" and keep my major holdings with Fidelity even though its ugly?

1aka17j,investing,the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world,"The story of how oil and gas tax benefits came to be is as rich and layered as the deposits these industries tap into beneath the earth's surface. It's a tale that intertwines with the very fabric of American history, innovation, and economic strategy, revealing why today, oil and gas investments stand as some of the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world.

To encourage exploration and production after the past energy crisis, the U.S. government implemented a series of tax incentives. These were not merely financial perks but strategic tools aimed at securing the nation's energy independence. The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) deduction, for example, allowed companies to deduct expenses from drilling new wells, an essential move to keep the rigs turning and the oil flowing. Similarly, the Depletion Allowance recognized the inherent decrease in value of oil and gas fields as they were depleted, offering a way to offset this loss against income.

\- The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) and Depletion Allowance are tax incentives for the oil and gas industry in the U.S. The IDC lets companies deduct drilling costs immediately.  
\- The Depletion Allowance reduces taxes on income from wells to account for resource depletion. Both were introduced to boost investment in oil and gas exploration, aiding U.S. energy independence efforts.

\-Lease costs, like the expenses for leasing minerals and rights, can be spread out over the lease's duration, offering tax advantages over time. Tangible Drilling Costs (TDCs) cover equipment used in drilling and can be depreciated over seven years. These tax incentives, along with the strong return on investment (ROI) potential in direct energy investments, make the sector an attractive choice for investors seeking tax efficiency and profitability.

  
These incentives did more than just stimulate growth in the oil and gas sector; they wove it into the very economic and energy fabric of the nation, making the U.S. a global energy leader. Yet, as the world shifts towards renewable energy, the narrative around oil and gas has evolved. The irony is that, in this transition, oil and gas investments have become some of the most undervalued assets, despite their continuing critical role in powering the modern world.  
Even as we champion the rise of renewables and the march towards electrification, the reality remains: the modern world continues to rely on the efficiency and flexibility of oil and gas. This is especially true as we navigate the complexities of integrating renewable sources into our energy grid, which still requires the reliability and on-demand power that fossil fuels provide. The shift to a more electric and renewable future doesn't negate the value of oil and gas; rather, it highlights their enduring importance in our energy mix.  
The tax benefits initially crafted to ensure energy independence have, somewhat unexpectedly, positioned oil and gas investments as some of the best tax-efficient yields available. Investors who recognize this stand to not only gain from the sector's undervalued status but also contribute to a balanced and pragmatic approach to our energy future.

1ak5vkk,investing,When do you know it's time to go it alone and ditch your FA?,"I started my investing journey about 10 years ago after receiving a windfall. I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA. As long as I am navigating any potential traps like not paying witholding taxes, I don't see any issues with that strategy as it's hard to beat the market. The S&P and related ETFs are gold standards for a reason, and some of the funds rebalance themselves.

They report earnings tomorrow after market close.

1ajyvfj,investing,Robinhood as a brokerage account,"Hi folks,

I’ve got about $8,000 laying around, doing nothing in my bank account, and I’ve been looking to invest it in more index funds. I’m in my late 20s, so I want to rebalance my portfolio to have more stocks as opposed to cash.

For the past year or so, I’ve been using Robinhood for dollar-cost averaging in VOO and QQQ (I started using RH when I was in grad school and a buddy sent me a referral link). 

Now, would it be better to switch to a more “traditional” account, say Fidelity (which handles my 401k, so I’ve had it in mind), or keep using Robinhood and invest the $8,000 in there, and transfer my current portfolio?

Any pros and cons to either?

1ajy53y,investing,VTI > VOO (by a small margin) for the upcoming years,"98% will think this is overkill, I get it, but hear me out...

VTI will outperform VOO by about 1-3% per year for the next few years.

Once interest rate cuts begin, the small caps that make up about 15% of VTI will start to perform well versus the stagnation they faced over the last few years due to lower borrowing costs, better risk appetite, etc.

**Returns over the last 1 year: VOO = 20.1% | VTI = 18.3%.**

**Returns over the last 5 years: VOO = 82% | VTI = 75.5%.**

If you have large sums of money to invest, the extra couple of percentage points add up.

As I prefaced, 98% will not care. Either way, DCA and chill. Get IWM if you want to go deep into small caps.",2024-02-06 01:48:29,2024-02-26 20:29:52.905433,20 days 18:41:23.905433,76,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajy53y/vti_voo_by_a_small_margin_for_the_upcoming_years/

Today, it’s approaching $200, and I’m still a buyer. My thesis has not changed. Demand shocks will continue to push prices higher, even as more production capacity comes online. The most advanced chips simply cannot be made fast enough to keep up with a world that wants server-side and client-side AI training and inference on every application and device. 

Chips that aren’t optimized for AI all have to be turned over for, or at least supplemented with, chips that are. 

AI is as big as the internet, maybe even bigger. People pay upwards of $100 a month for broadband internet, and eventually, they will pay the same for AI because it will deliver so much value. That money is going to be invested in chips, chips, chips.

1ajupdn,investing,What if this scenario plays out?,"March FOMC - no rate cuts. Market may not like this, and we have a 10% correction. 

&#x200B;

This 10% correction will set the stage for a massive economic situation to play out. The Federal Reserve will not want to abandon the inflation threat, so they are going to be aggressive at keeping interest rates high while doing nothing to control the National Debt.

&#x200B;

High interest rates will actually cause the Federal Reserve to have to increase the national debt, which in turn will cause inflation to come back over the Spring and Summer 2024 months.

&#x200B;

May FOMC - no rate cuts. Market will trade flat through the summer months. Economic situation with layoffs and job cuts will get worse. Banks will start to experience stress as they will be upside down in ""Bond gambling"" at a much faster rate than March 2023.

&#x200B;

September FOMC - Federal Reserve may have to institute emergency rate cuts, even with inflation running hot at 5% once again. This will cause a massive stock market crash, and being in September - right at the seasonal low for stock markets in general. S&P 500 could correct to 2,900 by January 2025.

&#x200B;

And the scary part - inflation may end up at 6% going into 2025 even if we have a major market crash, because the interest rate hikes do not address the cause of inflation. The government will actually likely create more inflation rescuing out big banks that may fail due to interest rate pressure, and I don't really know how this ends well.",2024-02-05 23:14:04,2024-02-26 20:29:52.905446,20 days 21:15:48.905447,16,0.26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajupdn/what_if_this_scenario_plays_out/

Am currently 24; life expectancy is about 75. I estimate about 50 years left to live, which is about 600 months. So 600 monthly rent payments instead of buying a house.  
  
Everyone in my family continues to tell me that buying is always superior to renting no matter the scenario. I'm not quite sure if this applies to my plan.  
  
I understand that buying real estate is powerful for many reasons (5x leverage 20% down, tax advantages, etc.) but what if:  
  
1. I plan to not marry or have any kids.  
  
2. I plan to ""die with zero"" meaning I want to die with as close to 0 dollars as possible since I'm not having any kids to pass any assets down to.  
  
3. I want to ""retire"" from working a job as early as possible.  
  
4. I want to have as little unnecessary stress as possible throughout the lifetime.  
  
  
The money that would have gone into the down payment and monthly mortgage would go to the SP500. Would it be reasonable to think that the SP500 will appreciate more than the real estate property? Or am I misunderstanding?  
  
My thinking with this is:  
  
1. SP500 and renting will have a lot less maintenance (no HVAC guy, no plumber, etc.)  
  
2. No property tax  
  
3. What's the point in building equity in this house if I will not pass it down to anyone? I don't want to die with 1-2 million dollars worth of house.  
  
Some possible arguments I can come up against my own point:  
  
1. monthly mortgage is fixed but rent increases in dollar amount over time (but also take into consideration that SP500 also increases in dollar amount over time)  
  
2. Possibly borrow against value of the home?  
  
3. A 20% down payment allows you to leverage (ex. You put down 200k to control a 1m asset. That's like 5x leverage and you de-leverage with each monthly payment)

1ajo5on,investing,Stock Market vs. Real Estate,"TLDR: invest $150K from HELOC into building a secondary suite on current primary residence or invest $150K into stock market?

We purchased our home in 2021. PP: $470,500. We put 20% down. Our mortgage is around $370K at 6.2% interest, variable rate. Current monthly payments are $2,100 which is basically only covering interest. Assessed value is $608K.  
  
We have put around $80K into the house in renovations and have done all the work ourselves, including the kitchen and bathroom, so there is some sweat equity in the home. A house across the street that was assessed at $672K sold for $642K a couple months ago. It is not nearly as nice as ours. I am not sure why the assessed value is higher considering ours is several sq. ft. larger, 2 floors ABOVE ground (as opposed to below ground) and we have a 2 car garage but I am definitely not going to complain (cause, property taxes).  
  
Needless to say, I do believe we have some equity in the home we'd be able to take out.  
  
We are looking to add an addition above our garage as a secondary suite. It is connected to our current home therefore it would not be classified as an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). We have had a contractor come look at it. The build would cost around $150K to add approx. 450-500 sq ft.  
  
To finance the build, we would need to borrow from a HELOC. What I've yet to understand is the interest rates on a HELOC in comparison to interest rates on our mortgage.  
  
The whole idea of this suite came about because our province is currently offering a forgivable loan up to $40,000 or 50% of construction costs, given you rent out the suite for below market rates for 5 years. 20% of the loan would be forgiven each year it is rented out. The below market rate in our area is \~$1,000/month. Therefore, we would be earning $12,000 gross rent + $8,000 loan forgiveness for the first 5 years, therefore, $100K. In addition, it is unclear whether a secondary suite would add the same amount of value to the home as it would cost. I am not sure whether a $150K suite would add $150K to our eventual sale price. However, since it is our principal residence, also consider the entire gain on the home would be excluded except for the rental portion of the property. Therefore, 450sq ft / 2,600 sq ft x cap gain on sale x (# of years lived in / # of years owned +1 year) = taxable gain x 50% effective tax rate (currently, 18%, but will increase).  
  
We live in a boaters/sledders town. The summer months are VERY busy in our community and winter brings about sledders too. After the 5-year period, we could airbnb the secondary suite and earn even more rental income.  
  
My partner asked 'well what would $150K look like if we invested it rather than built this secondary suite?' She is very against sharing a wall or any of our property with other people. My father-in-law gave me an example that conservatively, every 7 years your investment should double. Therefore, in 7 years $150K should = $300K. But we would have to consider the impact of paying back the $150K to the bank as well as any interest due on the loan. (This is hypothetical. I would not take out a $150K HELOC to invest as I don't think it would be worth it to go that much more into debt).  
  
My question is, what would you do? If you DID have an extra $150K that you did not need to get a loan for, would you build a suite or would you invest the money?",2024-02-05 18:49:20,2024-02-26 20:29:52.905479,21 days 01:40:32.905479,13,0.17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajo5on/stock_market_vs_real_estate/

But I am someone with basically zero risk tolerance, and I hate the idea of locking away money for 5-10+ years to get a relatively safe return through various investments (S&P 500 for example). Even a very small risk of losing money over time is a scary thought. Although I know it’s almost guaranteed to be better than CDs/HYSA in the long term. I still can’t help but prefer the safety that especially CDs provides.

Im just wondering if you strategically go for the highest rates offered whether HYSA or CDs, and use CD laddering when rates are high, if it can generally beat inflation in the long term. The last few years it’s clear it hasn’t. As inflation and available interest rates where very disproportionate. However recently with savings accounts offering 4+% and cds over 5% it seems to be an actual safe investment that at least slightly beats out inflation. although still very low when accounting for after tax profit.

But in the long term is it a bad idea to try and strategically use cds/hysa as a way of beating inflation? Especially when accounting for profit loss from taxes? Is it only ever a way of slowing down the effects of inflation rather than beating it? 

TLDR: Scared of losing money to inflation. Will CDs/HYSA generally at least keep up with it in the long term?",2024-02-05 12:29:18,2024-02-26 20:29:52.905514,21 days 08:00:34.905514,76,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajfcmh/cdhysa_vs_inflation_does_it_ever_beat_it_out/

1ajchbw,investing,My company is allowing some staff to buy shares. What do I ask to find out more?,"My company (private not public) told me today that high-performing staff are being given the option to buy shares in the company.   


The problem I have is that this is being taken out of our bonus, and we have the option to use a fixed percentage of our bonus (25% or 50%) to buy shares.  


On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.   


The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.   


All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?  


Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.

I charge based on AUM, but very little of what I do is related to investment management. I run my practice like a family office with the following services on an unlimited basis:
1. Investment management (largely passive, sophisticated hands on management including tax loss harvesting, building out individual bond ladders, providing access to alternative investment opportunities like late stage venture capital, real estate, and private equity). 
2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they’d need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire. 
3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way. 
4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly.
5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can’t manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments. 

I feel like I do a lot for my AUM fee, which starts at 0.65% and declines to 0.4% at $10M. However, it doesn’t seem like the world thinks very highly of what I do for a living.

1aim9bn,investing,Index fund: What are historical returns for quarterly vs monthly dollar cost averaging,"Main questions:
1)Is there a historical returns calculator where I can compare results for quarterly dollar cost averaging vs monthly? 
I could only find calculators with a monthly one. 

2)Historically,are returns higher if you dollar cost average monthly vs quarterly? 

Background/context


The reason why I am asking this is simple: I am buying NASDQ and S&P500 based in Eurooean stock exchanges because they have to be UCITs compliant and none of those are available in US stock markets. 

These ETFs are identical to the ones traded in the US and have barely any differences in returns unless they are hedged to another currency which increases or decreases returns based on the exchange rate. 

European stock exchanges have high comissions and clearing fees and bigger volumes mean it's cheaper for me to invest quarterly vs monthly.

The second reason I invest quarterly is because I need to maintain a high amount of savings for a number of reasons and that treshold is a minimum of 9 months of savings. 

I could list those reasons but that would make this post unnecessarily long.

I have been investing for some time now, I have ETFs and individual stocks.  
To select individual stocks, I use several websites to collect the appropriate information and to be able to filter for certain characteristics. I am now subscribed to FastGraphs basic and I also use the free versions of Yahoo Finance, Barchart, Finviz and tradingview for the technical part.

  
I spend quite a lot of time gathering information from several places, so I thought I'd rather subscribe to a website where I can put together a couple of screeners, so I don't have to jump between several pages and I can find the companies that may be relevant to me faster.

  
Info I need: at least 8-10 years of income, expenses, profit, forecasts, historical valuation indicators, Current ratio, ROA, ROE indicators for each company would be available.  
So far, I have collected them in Excel, this is quite a lengthy process, but at least I have seen the companies of the given sector side by side with all relevant indicators.

  
Lately, I mostly use finviz, but unfortunately there is no European share on this site, or only very limited ones. Regardless, I like and am thinking about Finviz Elite.

  
Since then, I've heard about gurufocus and many people have recommended it, but I don't know if it's worth the $450 a year.

1ai3xt5,investing,US Treasury Bond vs. Global Aggregate Bond ETF when treasury has higher yield,"Aggregate bond funds seem to be the usual recommendation for the bond component in a portfolio.  To compare them with treasury, I looked into the [Vanguard USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VUTA)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9598/usd-treasury-bond-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) and the [Vanguard Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF (USD Hedged) (VAGU)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9600/global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf-usd-hedged-accumulating).

Characteristics | VUTA (Treasury) | VAGU (Global Aggregate)
-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------
Effective Yield to Maturity | 4.10% | 3.80%
Average Maturity          | 7.9 years | 8.8 years
Average Duration          | 6.2 years | 6.8 years
Average Quality | AA+ | AA-
TER | 0.07% | 0.10%

I thought the higher YTM and (presumably) lower default risk mean that VUTA will have a higher expected return, but [Vanguard's own 10-year forecast](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html) predicts a better return from global bonds instead:

Forecast |U.S. aggregate bonds|Global bonds ex-U.S. (hedged)|U.S. Treasury bonds
-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------
10Y return projection|4.8%-5.8%|4.7%-5.7%|4.4%-5.4%
Median volatility|5.60%|4.40%|5.90%

Where can the \~1% excess return possibly come from? And when combined with stock funds in a portfolio, should I pick VUTA based on the higher effective YTM and a lower market correlation, or VAGU due to a higher predicted return despite the lower effective YTM? Thanks for your help.

1ai1euf,investing,Is Life Insurance a waste of money if you're debt free?,"Here's the situation - I have a $150 annual premium $25k death benefit $3.5k cash value life insurance policy (as of now.) It's generating about $72 of dividend income per my latest 1099-DIV that I received from it. 

&#x200B;

We have no mortgage, no car loans, we're DINKs, and only just opened a outstanding loan for replacing some of our windows and french doors in the house. 38 years old, wife is 39.

&#x200B;

I'm questioning right now if having this insurance does anything at all - as honestly when I pass away my 401K has a lot more money than this life insurance policy will pay out. My employer offers a $1m term policy they pay for, but at this point with no debts excluding that new loan, and enough cash to pay that off tomorrow if I wanted, I don't see any real benefit my wife or I would receive from any life insurance that I would have to pay for - and I'm really really thinking of just cashing this whole life policy out and putting the cash value into my Roth IRA. 

&#x200B;

I can see how someone with a huge load of debt would want enough life insurance to cover paying those loans off when they die so their family is not stuck with the loans - but when you are on the other end of that bridge debt free, I just don't see any benefit at all to life insurance if you have cash that will be passed along to beneficiaries.

After garnering huge asset flows in 2020 and 2021 (totaling an estimated $29.2 billion), its funds were decimated in the 2022 bear market, with losses ranging from 34.1% to 67.5% for the year. Many of its funds enjoyed a strong rebound in 2023, but that wasn’t enough to offset their previous losses. As a result, the ARK family wiped out an estimated $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the 10-year period—more than twice as much as the second-worst fund family on the list. ARK Innovation alone accounts for about $7.1 billion of value destruction over the trailing 10-year period.

1ahvyml,investing,Is a whole life insurance policy a good place to park money in for people under 30?,"I am looking for places to park money, mostly gains I earn from trading options on the stock market. The idea is to hide money from myself in vehicles where it will be both hard and impractical to cash out of but at the same time, said vehicles provide me with the flexibility to take loans out against them.  
My basic understanding is that term life insurance is useless because everyone in my family lives to 80+ years old and I am under 30 so a 30 year policy will result in lost money.

1ahat2m,investing,Pay Extra to Principal or Not,"I recently bought a house and have about a 6.5% rate. I can comfortably afford the mortgage payments right now and plan to refinance in 1-3 years assuming that rates drop as expected.

I also plan to sell the property in 3-5 years, although that is not a certainty (I may hold it for longer). 

I have plenty of cash sitting in a HYSA and I’m wondering it it makes sense to pay extra toward the principal each month or even as a lump sum right now. I could obviously invest that capital in other ways, and since I’m expecting that interest rates will drop I wonder if it’s worth doing.

My understanding at the moment is that it kind of doesn’t matter, but I’d appreciate hearing some opinions to the contrary. If I didn’t have conviction that interest rates would drop, I figure it would be sensible to pay off the loan faster. If I had a (much) better rate, I’d think paying it more slowly would obviously be more advantageous.

Does anyone have any advice on this? I’d appreciate any thoughts!",2024-02-02 18:39:34,2024-02-26 20:29:53.987464,24 days 01:50:19.987464,21,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ahat2m/pay_extra_to_principal_or_not/

34M located in NY.  305k in 401/457 accounts total as of today. 

Railroad employee for 10 years. 20 more to go and I will meet the requirement for retiring as a railroad conductor (30 years of service and age 55 minimum to collect a NYS defined pension with the MTA with no penalty. 60% of average of top 3 consecutive years in your last 10 of service. It is subject to cost of living increased)

Current pay 50 dollars an hour, with eye dental and medical all covered by employer. (Labor Contract expired by 2 years so we are due for a raise and retro). Also have had the options for overtime. 

I do not pay in to social security, I pay into railroad retirement. If I have 30 years of railroad service in my life, I will be able to collect my full railroad retirement pension as well at 60 years old instead of 62.  I believe it pays much more than Social Security, and is privately funded by the railroads so hopefully I am safe in the future with that.  My wife will be able to collect an additional 50% of my 100% regardless of if/ any she pays into social security.  Railroad retirement will either pay her  or allow her to collect SS come age if their payout is higher. 

My employer does not match anything into the 401(k) or 457, but they give me the option to have both. They provide the defined pension when I retire from service at 55 years old until I die, then my spouse takes over the payouts. They also cover my medical until I turn 65.  

I’m sure they do not match because they are providing with a defined pension.

I will not discuss my saving size as I have invested a lot into my house I purchased in 2022 because I bought it for a deal so I needed to provide a lot of equity upfront.   It needed an addition and lots of renovations. 


My only debt is my mortgage which is at 220,000 currently. Both cars are paid off and I have no credit card debt.

My biggest concern is the 401/457 when it comes time at 60 years old and am able to start using it, or if I die leave it to my family. I have a 300k life insurance policy as well. 

Does it look like I should be in a decent position? Any advice is appreciated.

Can someone share their opinions on my current plan?","I’m 34 and feeling a bit overwhelmed with where to park my cash here. I’m currently living in the East Coast and work as a software engineer making about $80K/year (company is based in the south). 

I’ve been dabbling with investing for the past 5 years and have learned a lot and been successful at it (I don’t do trading, just invest). I’m currently sitting on about $180K liquid and $50K in investments that I plan on keep using and hopefully, increasing in value.

I’ve checked out https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/early_career and some of the stuff there doesn’t necessarily apply to me: 

- Debt free

- I’m already married

- Neither me nor my wife want any children

- We’re not planning on buying a home.

My employment gives me a $401K and I’m using that but the question now comes to where to park my $180K

Due to the current state of the stock market, my thought process was to place $120K in a HYSA ($100K locked in a CD for 6 months and $30K in regular savings) and keep $50K liquid in my spending account as an emergency fund.  Overtime, once the general market corrects I was planning on moving the $100K into something longer term, perhaps a Roth IRA? But not 100% sure.

I’m slightly concerned that I don’t have enough to build a reasonable amount by the time I want to retire. Was curious about my plan and if it makes sense or if I’m way off.

**EDIT:** Realizing quickly that I'm most likely not optimizing my potential gains by sitting on HYSA, will research into what/where to invest for longer term plans.

According to a few calcs I’m confident in my ability to retire within the next 0-3 years though I’m still unsure. 

42 yrs old, $2.55M saved between brokerage and retirement accounts and misc, including $45k cash. i’m single, no kids, no debt, renter. 

AA is 72/28 though some have told me to get more aggressive. 

Currently unemployed due to a layoff. 

Annual budget is $52k and accounts for increasing healthcare expenses, though doesn’t account for the cost of a retirement home or hospice. 

Specific question: A while back I moved my brokerage to a new institution and unknowingly locked about 8 years of VTSAX covered shares into average cost basis. The rest of my brokerage is SpecID. The 8 years of VTSAX is a hefty portion of my brokerage. This means less control over cap gains and fewer chances to TLH. How do I take this into account when determining whether I’m ready to retire early? Is it relevant for a FIRE calculation? 

Vision is to retire from full time work and do part time consultant work to cover at least some of my costs.

1agnvra,investing,Are financial advisors worth it?,"Until recently I have been of the mindset of just buying VTI and self managing my investments. In my 401k I have some growth funds but still mostly total market funds. I have meet with a few financial advisors and until very recently never even considered it.
The last one I met with proposed a few changes with justifications that resonated with me. The idea was a flat ($900) fee for overall wealth planning, looking at my portfolio and making suggestions that I go and do but not doing any transactions for me. The fee would remain the same forever and be inclusive of advice for all of my money.  Some of the portfolio analysis made sense as to how I could get slightly better returns. 
My main question is at what point is it worth it to have a financial advisor as certain topics like retirement planning, what to sell to buy a house, tax loss harvesting are all topics I don’t know as much about. $900 is no small amount but it is less than 1% of what they would be advising on now and if they make  me .5% a year extra over time it is well worth it. Another question would be if I go with a fee based financial advisor is $900 high or low? And I fully intent to ship cost and approaches but what are some people’s experiences working with large companies like fidelity vs a smaller firm?",2024-02-01 22:40:14,2024-02-26 20:29:53.987656,24 days 21:49:39.987656,104,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1agnvra/are_financial_advisors_worth_it/

1aggokk,investing,Tech vs Broad Market Long Term,"I currently have a nicely diversified portfolio of Broad market and international etfs. It's been doing well for me but I have a friend that advocates dumping my etfs and focusing on more tech etfs. Over the past couple years his gains have absolutely obliterated mine, but as a long term investor, this doesn't really bother me. That being said, historically speaking, tech sector does seem to GENERALLY outperform the broad market. I've always heard that you really shouldn't try to beat the S&P over the long term because most people who try fail. This is advice I have always agreed with but it seems like tech sector does actually generally beat S&P. You can obviously cherry pick examples of when it doesn't, but you would need to do just that, cherry pick. The fact that my friends portfolio has been obliterating mine, in combination with the historical data (I initially thought it was just recency bias) I am starting to think his strategy might be better. I also happen to believe in the future of tech, I think the sector will look very different as time goes on but a future in which tech isn't the dominant market sector seems a bit unfathomable. It's nothing like the sectors of old, it certainly would not have been unfathomable to me that oil might one day not be the dominant sector. I also don't really consider Tech a ""sector"" it's more like multiple sectors under one umbrella so it has some inherent diversification. My mindset around diversification is shifting from diversification = good to diversification = important investing tool but can be both good and bad. I know some people who diversify so much that their gains are not much better than simply having a high yield savings account... in that case just get a high yield savings account lol. Lastly, because Tech is such a dominant sector, if tech goes down I feel like my diversification won’t really save me. My losses may be a little less extreme, but probably not much. Am I forgoing huge gains to MAYBE save myself a little in the event of a tech crash?",2024-02-01 17:38:48,2024-02-26 20:29:53.987766,25 days 02:51:05.987767,25,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aggokk/tech_vs_broad_market_long_term/

If you ask me, the EV revolution will end up morphing into a hybrid revolution as the most realistic short term outcome. Lithium has also taken a hit over the last few months but the industry will be riffed with aggressive consolidation via M&A throughout 2024 - this might favor a lot of US/nearshore junior miners.

Is now a good time to accumulate lithium while it's cheap? I mean, the green transition will ultimately be heavily dependent on lithium as a foundational metal (car batteries, electronics, etc). There are also no real viable replacements (sodium-ion, hydrogen cells, etc are just liquidity traps / R&D grant money syphoning affinity scams). I'm increasing my exposure to lithium miners across the board. (LIFT.v and ALB are my two main growth plays).

1afdxe0,investing,Let's be real - Are we underestimating the risk of index funds in the long run?,"I say this as someone invested in the index. Are we underestimating the risk of index funds in the long run? It seems on every financial subreddit, the advice is usually to invest in index funds. This is good, for now... but past performance is not an indicator of future performance. And each year, we are heading closer towards a market future dominated by index funds, an index fund tracking the index funds.

I think two very real possibilities that people need to consider in this future index fund dominated market; either a), the returns will be much lower due to too much passive investing or b) actively managed funds will out-perform passive investing.

Imagine a world dominated by index funds. If I buy stock from any company (even a bad one) I will drive up its share price and thus its index weight and force the passive investors along, which will further drive up the price at which I can sell a bit later, so I can easily front run the passive investors and will massively outperform them.  
Passive investing is depending on enough active investment happening, it needs to be in an equilibrium, if there is too much going on on the passive side, the active investors have a front-running advantage that will outweigh their higher cost of operations and they will outperform passive. If there are many active investors their front-running advantage is too small to outweigh their cost, and passive investors will outperform them because of that. That is the situation we're still in. 

With the increasing success of index funds and ETFs... is the future of index funds more uncertain than we think?",2024-01-31 09:22:01,2024-02-26 20:29:55.079703,26 days 11:07:54.079704,258,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1afdxe0/lets_be_real_are_we_underestimating_the_risk_of/

Point 1: So, first of all, there are two ways a person can make money off a stock: Either through dividends, or having the stock appreciate in value, and then selling it. Am I right to say that?

Let’s look at stocks without dividends. 

Point 2: A stock’s price is ultimately moved only by supply and demand. It doesn’t matter how successful a company is. At the end of the day, a stock’s price will only go up if there is demand for the stock. Am I right to say that?

Point 3: People buy stocks in hopes of the stock price increasing, but a stock’s price only increases when people buy the stock. 

With point 3 in mind, it leads to my final question, what drives the demand for stock in the first place?

- Bond pricing on start date: marked as ""100"" (?), as in ""a share of the bond costs 100€ to buy"". 
- Maturity: When you get back the 100€ you paid on start date, in ~93 years.
- Coupon (2.1%): You get 2.1% per year until maturity on the 100 invested (or 2.1€).
- Price: How much you need to pay to buy that 1 share today, i.e. ~74€.

I hope that's okay so far. Now comes the guesswork:

- Yearly: If I buy that bond at ~74€, the 2.1% coupon rate, then my expected yield is 2.1€ / 74€ = 2.837% per year
- At maturity: I get paid 100€

With the above, I can calculate the value: sum of all coupons until maturity, plus initial capital, or `93 * 2.1 + 100 = 295.3`. Then, I need to discount by **only one** (?) semi-magical number which I can pick as either inflation or the ""risk-free asset"" or any alternative asset (e.g. S&P500)? E.g. say I pick 2%, I would calculate the present value something like this: `295.3 / (1.02  ^ 93) ~= 46.82`.\*\*

Does that make any sense? Am I missing something? And \*if the above *is* correct (plus/minus some number variation), is that how bond pricing mostly works, and are the discrepancies in present value vs price the expected loss/reward?

1aesjy8,investing,"Bought a Corp Bond under TDA, now Schwab shows it as Blue Sky Restricted for my state","Anyone experience something like this?  I bought 7 contracts of a Corp Bond issued by Toronto Dominion (TD Bank Canada) through TD Ameritrade last year.  I thought it was a nice place to stash money I was using to invest in T-Bills since it was a buy and wait investment vs. monitoring and bidding on T-Bills on 4,8,13-week cycles.  It had a nice return rate for the time (6%) with quarterly payouts that allowed me to roll the dividends into other index funds.

As I've migrated over to Schwab, I'm seeing something I didn't see on TDA.  When I click on the details of the bond, it shows that my state (FL) has this as a Blue Sky restricted bond. Technically, I'm not allowed to own this...but I do.  I don't know if this has to do with TD Bank Canada, Schwab, or if it was in place all along and TDA didn't catch it when I placed the order.

1aerz0n,investing,Calculating Net Investment/ACB,"Anyone else do this or find logic in this ideology to keep track of their net investments or am I just misleading myself.

E.g.

I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment

The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600

I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB’s for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows

16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share
1 AMD = about $90/share

MSFT trading at $410
AMD trading at $178

Essentially since I didn’t add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.

Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what i’ve put in as net investments.

the numbers that they get are not accurate.   
if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.   
on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT  
Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.  
Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.  
This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.

1ae6ei7,investing,"Allocation options, which to pick?","Hello,

I work in the public sector in Ohio. My employer uses OPERS which, as far as I can tell, I have no control over. It’s set based on my hours or pay.  So that is what it is but because I’m in the public sector I also have access to the Ohio Deferred Comp where I have a 457 plan set up. 

Right now I’m interested in maximizing the performance of the money I’m putting into the 457 and also setting up a Roth 457 plan also through Ohio DC. 

When I get to the screen where I can make selections for how the money is allocated I am completely lost.  The regular 457 plan is set up for the LifePath 2050 portfolio however after listening to some Ramsey videos I think I want to change it up to spreading my allocations evenly across large, mid, small cap mutual funds and also international. I’m guessing I should mirror that for my Roth 457. 

Where I get stuck is on the Ohio DC website there are multiple options under each of the categories I mentioned above and have no idea which to pick or how to determine which to pick which brings me here. 

I will list out what the options are below if someone could shed some light on what the differences are and provide any guidance on how to pick the right ones. 

Large Company Stock options:
- Fidelity Growth Company CP
- Fidelity Contrafund CP
- US Large Growth Company Stock
- US Large Value Company Stock
- US Large Company Stock Index

Small company/Mid Company Stock
- US Small Growth Company Stock
- US Small Value Company Stock
- US Small/Mid Company Stock Index
- Vanguard Capital Opportunity 

Non-US Stock
- Non-US Company Stock
- Non-US Company Stock Index

Then there’s a list of different LifePath portfolios, bonds, and a “stable value option” 

These are how they are listed on the selection screen and the only other thing to see is their Fund Performance which I don’t know what to make of.

1ae6dpv,investing,Merits of buying foreign stock in foreign currency vs US currency.,"I'm having a hard understanding how it would affect my gains if I buy in foreign currency vs my normal USD currency, and why one would buy with one or the other. I'm not talking about OTC or ADR, or the pink sheet. I am talking about buying actual stock on the actual foreign exchange.

So if I am using USD and JPY as example:

If I buy in USD, the % gain or unrealized gain I see already includes the potential gains/ loss from the changes of the currency exchange rate between the two currency at that point in time (built in currency exchange risk is reflected)?

Whereas if I buy in yen, the % gain or unrealized gain I see is the gain from the investment only. The actual gain/ loss could be greater/ lower depending on whether the yen got stronger or weaker compared to my initial investment currency exchange rate (currency exchange rate is not reflected)?

and if i expect the yen to strengthen to the dollar, buying in yen would hedge against currency risk at the cost of slightly lower gains? This would mean higher floor and lower ceiling?

Does it matter if, when/if I withdrawal, I'll be withdrawing in USD (as I can't use Yen in the US) anyways that I have it in one currency or the other? Because to me, the actual money I'll be getting in the end is the same, it is just a matter of whether the % gain of the portfolio is higher/lower due to currency fluctuation... though if I buy in USD, and the currency fluctuation decreases my % gain, maybe I might pay less taxes?

Like let say I buy at the same time and sell at the same time, my real gain/losses would be the same if I were to buy with Dollars or yen (convert back to dollars after sell) right? Lets say actual investment gains is 10%, but currency gains/losses X%.

If I buy with dollars, the % gain/losses I see on the website would be the 10% + X% or 10%-X% built in already right?

Whereas the yen, the % gain and losses I see on the website would only be the 10%, and I would need to factor in the X% movement on the currency?

So it basically doesn't matter at the end?",2024-01-29 21:13:05,2024-02-26 20:29:55.080007,27 days 23:16:50.080008,4,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ae6dpv/merits_of_buying_foreign_stock_in_foreign/

If so many non-bitcoin investors begin to invest in this ETF, this could possibly lead to the government approval of bitcoin.

We asked our rep at Morgan Stanley to cash out this annuity before Christmas, however as of last week the asset manager that I'm working with has told me that he ""has no update yet"" from the annuity company. Being told that they have contacted the annuity company, but the process seems to be taking a while.

Should the process take this long? MS will be losing the account as we are closing it out, so I'm wondering if they're just dragging their feet.",2024-01-29 15:31:43,2024-02-26 20:29:55.080090,28 days 04:58:12.080091,6,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ady0ir/time_required_to_liquidate_an_annuity/
1adwg9t,investing,Stock Ownership - Capital Gains vs Dividends,"Hi everyone,

I would like to get a bit of insight from you guys concerning the real purpose of stock ownership.

Traditionally, one purchased public traded stocks to become an equity owner of a company. And, as an owner -- albeit a very, very small stakeholder -- you received your share of the company's profits as a dividend. Today, this still true.

However, for the past many, many decades, the most popular way to earn a return on your stock investment for companies that don't pay a dividend is solely through capital gains. The capital gains don't come from the company, but from whatever you sell your shares to.

My question is, how can a stock shareholder be an ""owner"" of the a public traded company, if the return comes from a buyer via capital gains, versus the truest way to be an ""owner"" through dividends?

It makes sense that dividends are your share of the company's profits. But, with capital gains from a stock that doesn't pay dividends, you aren't profiting from the company's profits like a real owner.

Capital gains are simply the price another person is willing to pay  The capital gains aren't fringe the company.

Furthermore, the only legal thing a company gas to do concerning your shares is to pay you the PAR VALUE of those shares as stated in the company's financial statements.

So, if you own one share of a stock that is currently trading as $50 a share, that stock's par value could be something like $0.0001 per share for example.

What are your opinions and insights concerning this issue?

Does relying on capital gains really make you an equity owner in a company that doesn't pay dividends?

Thanks!

1adv1k3,investing,"(HELP)Not Understanding a certain part of the book ""Liar's Poker""","""One of the benevolent hands doing the stuffing belonged to the Federal Reserve. That is ironic, since no one disapproved of the excesses of Wall Street in the 1980s so much as  the chairman of the Fed, Paul Volcker. At a rare Saturday press conference, on October 6, 1 ?79, Volcker announced that the money supply would cease to fluctuate with the business cycle; money supply would be fixed, and interest rates would float. The event, I think, marks the beginning of the golden age of the bond man. Had Volcker never pushed through his radical charge in policy, the world would be many bond traders and one memoir the poorer. For in practice, the shift in the focus of monetary policy meant that interest rates would swing wildly. Bond prices move inversely, lockstep, to rates of interest. Allowing interest rates to swing wildly meant allowing bond prices to swing wildly. Before Volcker's speech, bonds had been conservative investments, into which investors put their savings when they didn't fancy a gamble in the stock market. After Volcker's speech, bonds became objects of speculation, a means of creating wealth rather than merely storing it. Overnight the bond market was transformed from a backwater into a casino.

1adavih,investing,Can big crowdfunding companies be sued for their incorrect valuations of start-up companies which lead to failed investment? Seedrs and AllPlants,"I am a normal investor who is still learning, back in 2020 COVID times I tried different approach to invest into startup company which was advertised on my delivery box. I used to be AllPlants subscriber box meal. I remember large 6, 1000 calorie meals which were vegan and super tasty cost £59 so during COVID I subscribed due to lack of time to cook

My box had a leaflet saying we are crowdfunding and it was during times when everything was climbing up in price, people forgot about fears of recession and everyone felt like was in the mood to buy so they don't miss out on bargains.

AllPlants crowdfunding went so well in first stage mainly because they advertised as 20% share price discount so I think they raised 3.4m they beat few records. There were headlines. Even UK prime minister was seen with AllPlants box delivery outside.

I bought into that stage £1,000 EIS. Valuation was at £17.51 per share so I guess their real valuation was £22 per share as I was getting 20% discount.

Valuation of shares came at £25.89 later in 2021

In 2022 I bought another £1,000 worth now at £25.89 stupidly thinking I already made 30% profit they might have potential to grow.

For some reason mid 2022 things were going down and negative outlook on media made me realise I want to cash in on my A2 EIS shares I bought at £17.51 so I started selling them as they were available to sell on Seedr website.

I managed to offload about £1000 worth of shares at about 10-20% loss just trying to get rid of them but getting later to end of 2022 Seedr disabled AllPlants to be on secondary market so I was no longer able to place orders for people to buy. I was confused, as I remember it was something to do with valuations and AllPlants cannot be on secondary market due to some regulations.

I stopped putting effort into selling and forgot about this account fast forward to 2024 I thought I'd login to see what my shares are doing and if I can sell or did they grow.

Turns out in July 2023 valuation of AllPlants and new share price came at £1.61 can you believe it? 
So 29 Sept 2021 is £25.89
But on 5 July 2023 is £1.61

I can imagine what you already thinking, when you invest into start ups and do crowdfunding it is only your fault to invest into something so fragile but thinking more about this situation making me realise this was like investing into crypto or penny stocks but we are talking about food delivery company which still delivers today.

I am not even angry about losing £900 ish, it was rather a lesson but what makes me angry and confused is how is it possible that Seedr biggest crowdfunding website in UK gets away with it. How is it possible they came and valued AllPlants at 89,000,000 but 2 years later they said this company is worth 9,000,000. After all Seedrs website says ""selected and managed by experts"". 

I don't know much about startup companies but I understand during COVID their sales must of been higher and I can guess their sales are way lower logically but why can the experts get away with valueing companies wrongly and overinflate prices and then investors lose money.

Almost feels like their website slogan is wrong instead of saying
""Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest""
Should say 
""We will make sure that you lose money after we over inflate the valuation of the company you invest in then drop it down to normal value""


And you could say my shares were diluted and I received extra shares, no after holding 97 shares I recieved only 9 shares due to dilution and instead of portfolio value of roughly £900-1000 it is now worth £83.41.

Surely these things need to be regulated or normal investors will lose big money the fact that when I tried to sell AllPlants shares and seedr disabled them on secondary market sounds dodgy. How are people who value companies wrong don't lose their jobs and pay price like investors do and AllPlants have the largest kitchen in Europe apparently. Just seems like it was a big planned scam from the start for their kitchen and salaries

Or is this purposely over inflated high valuations normal and Seedrs is doing nothing wrong?",2024-01-28 19:32:31,2024-02-26 20:29:55.080195,29 days 00:57:24.080196,6,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1adavih/can_big_crowdfunding_companies_be_sued_for_their/

Currently I believe the company is undervalued and it's been doing very well in a high interest environment which leads me to believe that when rates start dropping in the second half of 2024 they will continue to do well. 

Another factor is that Canada is low on houses for our population so this will be another factor of several years of AEP helping with the builds.

I work as a Carpenter and over the last couple years most of the residential sites I'm on get all the wall and floor systems delivered to site and then they just get craned in and installed, super easy and efficient. This saves tons of money on labour and material. Not to mention there's a skilled trades shortage so there's not always someone available to frame the walls by hand, if layouts are complete anyone can fly in a wall.

1ad4o5w,investing,Ethical Investing - seeking advice on how to buy into industries I support and avoid those I don't,"I want to invest in industries/businesses I personally support and avoid those I don't. But I also see how the companies that I don't support are perfectly poised to be industry leaders in the fields I do support.

For example, I do not support fossil fuels, but rather want to focus on renewable energy. I say this knowing full well that ExxonMobil or Shell would be first in line to shift their entire business strategy to wind/solar as soon as it becomes the more profitable option.

Same with cannabis and tobacco. I hate cigarettes and fully support cannabis legalization and want to ride that wave up to the top. But I just know Philip Morris is gonna move a significant portion of their production line to cannabis once the government makes it feasible to be the biggest player in that field.

And in terms of defense and arms stocks, I hate guns and war. Yet I know that peace isn't possible without countries arming themselves to the teeth to prevent invasion, and fully support the defense of Ukraine and Israel. Plus, you can't really buy ""peace"" stocks.

Add to this the fact that the majority of desirable index funds and ETFs all include those less-ethical stocks (and crypto which I also hate). I don't see any reasonable way to avoid them without cherrypicking stocks like I'm shopping at the financial equivalent of a health food store.

1acfjuy,investing,Help! 5 days left to decide whether to exercise company stock options.,"
I was laid off. Company used to be public but was acquired by two major private equity firms just before I started working there. 

I have 1500 NSOs (non qualified options), exercise price is $10. Fair market value is not disclosed by the company but documentation says: The exercise price per Common Unit to be purchased upon exercise of an Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date.

The company doesn’t offer an exchange. Liquidity only comes with them going public again. 

If I exercise, the company has the right to repurchase at the current fair market value. Also, if I exercise, and the company does not repurchase, I will hold them until a sale event, if one occurs. 

How can I assess the fair market value? I read the company can reprice options at any time. 

Tax implications of NSOs mean two rounds of taxation, similar to RSUs I think:

When you exercise your company stock options, you’ll be taxed on the difference between your strike price (fixed purchase price) and the current FMV of those stock options

If you sell your stock within a year of when you exercised your options, you’ll pay short-term capital gains tax on any increase in value since the exercise date. If you sell after more than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax. 

I have the cash to cover the options (the cost is a small portion of my total portfolio value) though it’s hard to say whether this is a smart move. The company is a leader in its market and the private equity firms are big players who clearly want to set up the company for M&A.

1ac8mnt,investing,"Relative value of two investements, wich one is better?","Hey guys, here is the dilemna:  
You are given two choices to invest your savings:  
A) You get 10$  
B) 50% chance of getting 20$, otherwise 0$  
Mathematically wise, this is the same. However I was questionning two things:  
First, risk of course. I think people in general would prefer having 10$ each time rather than 20$ half of the time.  
Second, marginal value. IF you did econ in your life, you know that the more you get something, the less it is ""useful"" (marginal utility is a concave function). Thus, in our case, choice B would give less utility than choice A. In that case, how much money would, if divided by two give the same utility as 10$ each time. (Let there be a choice C where:  
U(10$) = U(X$)/2  
U(1000$) = U(X$)/2  
U(10000000$) = U(X$)/2  
Provided this, we can observe that X is not constant but a function. (People wouldnt really care about receiving 2$ 50% of the time instead of 1$ but would care if they received 100M 50% of the time instead of 50M).  
Does a function already exist about this?

1ac2io7,investing,Expect More Bank Failures as BTFP Expires,"Expect More Bank Failures as BTFP Expires 

By Hermes Lux

The banking sector will soon experience another wave of failures and consolidation as the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a lifeline for struggling banks, is set to expire in March 2024. 

The BTFP is a Fed program that provides loans of up to one year to eligible depository institutions (mostly small banks) pledging collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks. The program was created in March 2023, after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, to lend to other banks that had big unrealized losses on their holdings of government bonds and were, therefore, at risk of large-scale withdrawals of deposits. The Fed has no plans to renew the BTFP for a very specific reason. 

The BTFP has helped many banks survive the past year with surging interest rates, which caused a significant decrease in the market value of the U.S. Treasury and government-backed mortgage securities held by banks. However, the program is scheduled to end in March, leaving many banks vulnerable to liquidity and solvency problems. Some of these smaller banks are likely to fail in Spring 2024.

According to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank last year cost the agency $18.7 billion. The FDIC imposed a special assessment on 114 financial institutions totaling $16.3 billion to recover lost funds, but they know the money will never be recovered. That’s the whole point. JPMorgan Chase $JPM, Bank of America $BAC, Wells Fargo $WFC, and Citigroup $C paid the largest assessments, which dragged on fourth-quarter earnings, as expected and as according to plan.

These are the 4 largest banks in the US with more than $12 Trillion in assets combined.  These four banks are too big to fail. Behind the scenes it is also these four banks that make up the majority of the direct influence of the cartel that is the Federal Reserve System, which, despite its name, is not Federal nor is it a government system. 

Recently, the FDIC warned that more bank failures are expected in March and April 2024, as many smaller banks are unable to repay their BTFP loans or cope with the rising debt burden. The agency said that it is working closely with the Federal Reserve (the Cartel) and other regulators (US Treasury) to monitor the situation and ensure the stability of the banking system. In other words, it’s for the greater good, and in the end, the bank consolidation will justify the decision by the FDIC, Treasury and the Fed. 

Ultimately , the Fed is trying to consolidate small banks into larger ones, as part of its strategy to reduce the systemic risk and complexity of the financial sector. The central bank (cartel) is said to be offering incentives and regulatory relief to encourage mergers and acquisitions among lesser banks, especially those with assets below $10 billion.

The banking industry Is facing a critical moment, as the expiration of the BTFP will likely trigger another round of failures and consolidation. The outcome of this process will have significant implications for the economy, the financial system, and the depositors. 

What does this mean for the markets? In one word, volatility. A crash of some kind, certainly. 

The Fed will likely be forced to lower interest rates and/or flood the markets with more liquidity causing a rise in inflation.

Be warned and be ready. $VIX.",2024-01-27 04:36:52,2024-02-26 20:29:56.495508,30 days 15:53:04.495508,69,0.51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ac2io7/expect_more_bank_failures_as_btfp_expires/

This is will be my second account (other being a 3-fund strategy taxable investment account basically) but with the tax savings, I wonder which assets would perform best:

1. Dividend investing: some kind of S&P500 dividend etf (think NOBL) and set it up as a DRIP since to my understanding reinvestment of the dividends does not count against contribution limit. I’m not a naturally math-savvy guy, would the compounding growth over some constant accounts make the portfolio grow better than the other 2 options?

2. index tracked fund: Classic VOO. If it’ll get put in there and not touched over 30+ years, I know it’ll grow (assuming S&P do what S&P do). Again, without running down a rabbit hole would this outperform a consistent DRIP account?

3. Classic 3 fund strategy: Whole market, Foreign Market, Bonds. Safe, boring, and bonds which in a retirement account sounds useless. But you get the point….any 2,3,3+1 account based off of “diversification” and safe investment

There are other factors like if their house is paid off, kids etc, but just as a basic example do you need bonds really if your balance is what you would consider high?

Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.

Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.

Operating Margins: 

|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|

|42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|

\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.

***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***

Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue: 

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|

|35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|

\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.

\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.

|Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%|
|Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|

**AirBnb:**

The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.

**Website Traffic:**

Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.

Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S

***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***

Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.

Expedia operating margins:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.

The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

1abfj93,investing,Replacing SP500 ETF exposure with options (or similar),"Hi.  UK-based investor here.

I need to sell a significant chunk of of my investment portfolio (SP500 tracking ETFs; ticker: VUSA) to fund the cash purchase of a house. Let's say £100K for easy numbers.  My concern is that I will be (partially) out of the market for 6-12 months, so I could miss out on stock market upside.  

I want to avoid a margin loan in case the lender changes the terms on which shares/ETFs are acceptable as collateral.  And I can't seem to borrow/re-mortgage sufficient money quickly enough to finance the house purchase.  So I'm considering selling the shares and re-gaining that lost market exposure by buying call options.

I can't be the first person to do this.  Does anyone have any recommended reading/links?  I'm interested in owning the upside if the market rises significantly e.g. >10%.  My first though is to buy long dated out of the money calls, because the calls should be fairly cheap to get  significant exposure. Of course I appreciate they are likely to expire worthless.  In the meantime i will use the capital for the house purchase.

Comments and suggested reading would be most welcome. If there is an alternative strategy then I'm all ears.

Thanks!

1abe8s2,investing,Dollar cost averaging strategy for current investments.,"Say you had ten shares, each with various levels of profit, how would you dollar cost average into it?

Say for theories sake,  you had a 1000 usd on each share, and you had 100 usd for each DCA.

Would you DCA into the most profitable share, the least profitable, something in the middle, or just split it and throw 10 usd at each?

Share 1: 173%

Share 2: 68%

Share 3: 57%

Share 4: 55%

Share 5: 46%

Share 6: 23%

Share 7: 18%

Share 8: 2%

Share 9: -4%

Share 10: -37%

If you DCA into the most profitable, you would obviously be increasing your investment into a company that is doing well, but then if it dropped, share 2 could take over as your DCA. The negative though is that if the company is at an ATH it could drop drastically.

If you DCA into the least, it would reduce your loss percentage, and if the company was at it's lowest, the profits could be large. The risk though is if it's a bad investment and you could lose more.

DCA into a share in the middle or 10usd on each I suppose is a safer strategy.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this

1abc41a,investing,"Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?","


I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. 

For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. 

Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

19fgbu1,investing,One common mistake of a novice trader,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  
For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   
Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  
The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  
That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",2024-01-25 18:36:53,2024-02-26 20:29:56.495693,32 days 01:53:03.495694,4,0.18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fgbu1/one_common_mistake_of_a_novice_trader/

19fg465,investing,Capital loss and wash sale rule,"I am new to stock invensting. I am sure this topic has been discussed plenty of times. I googled the topic quite much but still did not get a clear answer. 

Wash sale rule states: ""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then purchases the same or a substantially similar security within 30 days, before or after the transaction.""

I totally get that we cannot buy it within 30 days after the transaction, but I am not clear about the situation when we buy it within 30 days before the transaction. Does this mean if I buy a new stock, and then sell it after three days with a loss, I CANNOT claim a capitial loss since I buy it ""within 30 days"" prior to the transaction (the sale)? I try to use the following hypothetical scenarios (using very popular VTI and VOO as examples) to understand this problem.

Scenario 1:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and unfortunately market crashed, and I sold all shares on Thursday with a value of $9K, and then bought VOO with the money and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $1K?

Scenario 2a:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  I sold all shares the next Tuesday with a total worth of $17K. I then bought VOO with this $17K, and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $3K?

Scenario 2b:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  On Tuesday of the next week, I sold the shares I bought on Monday, with a total value of $8K, but kept the shares I bought on Thursday. I then bought VOO with this $8K, and then held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $2K?

On Fidelity Net Benefits I am able to see more details on the fund, here the name on the fund profile is ‘Jennison Large Cap Growth’, pretty much what I already knew about it.

I searched for the name online and the closest thing I could find was PJFAX. However these are not the same as they have different NAVs, expense ratios (the one in my 401k is a lower ratio) etc. 

On the fund profile I can get to from NetBenefits it says under the name “Information on this investment option was provided by your plan sponsor, plan trustee, investment manager, trustee or third party data provider. This investment is not a mutual fund”. I don’t see any ticker for it on the profile either.

This leaves me asking, what is this fund if it isn’t a mutual fund? I’m still able to invest in it, it has good returns at a pretty good expense ratio (Life return of 14.64% at 0.4474% exp ratio). Mostly just curious about this investment and what it is. Thanks for any help!

Edit: just wanted to clarify the Life Return I put is the Quarter-End Average Annual Total Returns for the life of the fund.",2024-01-25 18:26:28,2024-02-26 20:29:56.495709,32 days 02:03:28.495710,2,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fg309/figuring_out_one_of_my_investments/

I’m a contrarian generally so when things seem good, like when the markets start hitting all time highs, I begin to get worried, So I thought I’d bring it up here and see if there is anyone who might have some insight to share or something to add.

One of my biggest concerns is what is happening now in China. China now being the second largest economy in the world has considerable impact on the world should some type of economic crisis occur there. I began searching for historical parallels to day to see if they might help me get a better grip on what might happen in the future.

One thing I happened upon, which I had completely forgotten about occurred back in 1997. [The 1997 Asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis) and it does appear to have some similarities to what is occurring today in China.

In 1997 one of the things which contributed to the crisis was capital flight as concerns grew over the stability of the currencies in Asia. Today the something similar is happening, [Capital is leaving China at the fastest pace in more than 8 years](https://archive.ph/Ipwgn).

Obviously this is not 1997 so events from those days will not translate directly to today but looking back can often lead to insights about what the future might hold.

19f6stg,investing,Understanding adding Bonds to my portfolio,"Hi all, 

My investment goal is to add bonds to my portfolio for diversification and risk managment. Right now as a young investor my portfolio mostly contains stock. 

What i want to do is have bonds so that in times of low interest rates and poor stock performance, i can sell bonds in order to generate capital to buy stocks at a discount. Im kind of thinking of this as a cash position for those times except something that earns a bit more than a large cash position would. 

Im trying to make sure i understand these assets right in order to be able to do that. What i think i want is a long maturity bond since i dont expect an economic downturn soon. I dont plan on holding this asset to maturity and simply want to sell it at a profit in a future poor economic market. 

So thats where im looking to understand more. 

From my current understanding a low coupon bond would perform better in this poor market scenario that i am trying to hedge against. The market at that hypothetical time would have low interest rates and poor stock performance which would increase the value of my bond. Whereas a bond with a high coupon rate wont be as valuable since that coupon is reinvested in a low interest market. However im worried that a long maturity zero coupon bond might be hard to sell since it wont be attractive to anyone looking for passive income. Is this a valid concern?

Does this mean that a long maturity treasury zero coupon bond would be the best option for what im looking for?

I also have some questions about the tax implications of the treasury zero. I know that for zero coupon bonds you still get taxed on phantom interest. But since its a treasury zero im not sure if it is tax exempt.

Does anyone know the answers to some of these questions?

19f2t0v,investing,Beware of Money Managers who Talk Like This,"I came across an interesting thread where a money manager was describing the strategy of the ETF that they manage, an investment solution they offer through their wealth management practice.  


He illustrated that their clients are invested in their ETF, **$HF** \- an ETF he runs through their practice, DGA Advisors.  


In his words:

>  
*I'm a global macro-manager.*  
*One of the ways we reduce unsystematic risk in our absolute return portfolios ($HF) is to utilize macro diversification. This starting point aligns with your initial thoughts on positioning to reduce market timing and individual security selection.*  
*As an active manager, I* ***manage a model-driven systematic hedging overlay to the core global macro portfolio that doesn't approach active management from a perspective of market timing but from a framework of gradient risk exposure.***

Notice the buzz words **""Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay"" and "" Macro Diversification""**  


Anyway - since the fellow linked his name and his practice I couldn't help myself but to check out $HF, this so called Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay Strategy.  


Quick summary of $HF - this is a ""long-short"" portfolio.:

  
It has 8 holdings, ALL INDEX Funds. They are VTI + VT + SPYV +SPYG + SPY + SH +QQQ +DIA.  
Roughly 30% is allocated towards $SH which is ProShares Ultrashort S&P.  
The remainder is long equities, but across major index funds VTI, VT, SPYV, SPYG, SPY, QQQ, DIA.  
**Oh - and the expense ratio is 1.53%.**  


This ETF is basically a closet index fund with unusual overlap (SPY + SPVV+SPYG??) with a 30% short position.  
""Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay"" .... yikes.

Both of my parents receive a pension as well as social security, which essentially sets them for life. They also have free hospitalization for life as well. Short of needing to go to a care facility, they should not need to touch any of their savings. 

But here's the problem - my parents have never invested a single dollar their entire life. They always just assumed the only thing you can buy is stocks and it was too risky and you could ""lose it all"". Ok, I get that, but only recently are they coming around to believing me about index funds and other relatively lower-ish risk investments.  

So, fast forward to where we are now. We are in the process of downsizing them to an apartment closer to where we are to better look after them and get them out from maintaining a home, etc.
When it's all said and done between current savings, home sold, moved into new place and furnishings purchased,  etc they will have upwards of $1M just sitting in a bank account. Why? Because that's just what you always did. 

Anyway, seems crazy to me. 

I am hoping to receive some advice and ideas for me to approach them with in order to help the money grow atleast a little over the next 10 to 15 years. Low-ish risk funds, bonds, other kinds of funds? Their goal is to leave money for the kids and grandkids.
They won't need to touch this except for extreme emergency as their pensions cover all living expenses +. 

No, they will not consider seeing a financial adviser. But, if I can gather up some ideas and my brother and I research, we can present them with a plan. He and I both actively manage our own funds thru Vanguard so we would do the same for them. Just some thoughts/ideas for that amount of money for retirement-aged people. 
Thank you.",2024-01-25 00:56:50,2024-02-26 20:29:56.495847,32 days 19:33:06.495847,24,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19ewoze/need_advice_for_how_to_help_my_parents_nest_egg/

19epe29,investing,Made My First Investment At 20.,"Just bought 2 shares of AMD and 1 share of Nvidia all for $1000.

 Thoughts? I invested in Nvidia due to them being a leader in AI hardware and AMD due to their growing server market share.

They're losing consumer and server market share but still retain market share in pre-builts so they could just ditch it in the future and just fabricate chips for other companies.

I was told to expand my portfolio so I plan on doing so. Is there any other sector besides the tech and overall market (VOO/ NASDAQ) that I should invest in? All the companies I can think of are all tech related, which I mean makes sense because tech is the #1 selling thing to consumers and companies. Just wanted to make sure.

19ek8f6,investing,Should I invest in a Traditional or ROTH IRA?,"Hello, I am 26 years old, married and starting to grow a savings and am relatively new to handling my finances. My parents aren't really a help so I was hoping I could get some advice here.

I make about $60,000 a year and my wife makes $40,000 so our combined income is about $100,000. We live our lives really low cost and over the last 4 years have saved up about $95,000.

Right now that money is just sitting in a regular low interest savings account. I feel like I should do something with this money. I was looking at IRA's and saw that Traditional IRA's can lower your taxable income. In looking at the tax brackets for 2023, it looks like at around $89,000 for a married couple the tax bracket goes from 22% to 12% which is a huge jump.

So If I'm understanding this correctly, if we were to invest say $11,000 in a traditional IRA (Say about $1000 a month) we would then get 10% more money back in our tax returns?

I'm curious if that's how it works and how easy is it to accidently lose it? Like if I get a bonus from work or a raise, or my wife who is a teacher picks up an extra job in the summer? Sorry if I sound like a novice again my parents know nothing about this stuff so I'm trying to figure it all out. Looking at getting a financial advisor as well, just not sure how much they cost.

19egy4s,investing,Do you still feel confident investing in Google after the obliteration of the search results?,"Pretty simple question, if you have been using Google the past few years you may have noticed how poor the results have become. Particularly in certain areas of the internet like 'local' where currently if you search for best x in city for 98% of terms you just get fed whatever Yelp, TripAdvisor, or YellowPages list has the best keyword match in their title regardless of how old or relevant the actual content is.

5 to 10 years ago those results were filled with local newspapers, bloggers, tv stations, travel bloggers, and other small niche sites that actually had good boots on the ground info. Today they are just outdated lists that were often inaccurate from the start. 

Don't believe me? Google 'best craft stores in city' or 'best art supply stores in city' and replace the word city with any of the 10 through 200 biggest cities in the US.... I'll bet dollars to donuts you find those 3 sites I just mentioned and little else in the top 5.

I know Google has all kinds of things going on with their company, I know the old search is dying (if not already dead) and AI results are coming, but at the end of the day search is Google's brand whether they want to admit it or not and for the last 3 or 4 years they have done nothing but go downhill in this regard.

19egx14,investing,The Buy-Back Delusion - How Accounting Deludes Investors,"THE belief that share buy-backs are a universally good thing seems hard to shake, even though there was a time when they were seen as a sign of the lack of imagination in a company's management. But an excellent paper from Terry Smith, who made his fortune in the city as a broker but who was once an analyst who wrote a hard-hitting book called Accounting for Growth, puts buy-backs in their proper perspective.

If two identical companies decide to return cash to shareholders, one via a buy-back and the other via a dividend, the earnings per share of the first group (but not the latter) will rise. This will create the impression that the first group has added value. But the return on equity of both groups will be unchanged! This can lead to potentially confusing outcomes.

Mr Smith suggests the example of Fred Futile, the CEO of Stagnant Inc. He is awarded a 10-year option over the company's stock at the current price of $100 per share. There are initially 100m shares in issue and annual earnings are $1 billion. So he cancels the dividend and uses all the earnings (which remain flat throughout the 10 years) to buy back shares; earnings per share rise and the p.e remains the same. By the end of the 10-year period, the eps will have more than doubled from $10 tr $25.8 and the share price will have risen to $25 earning Fred Futile $158m for himself. But the company isn't really more valuable, it's just more geared.

So he cancels the dividend and uses all the earnings (which remain flat throughout the 10 years) to buy back shares; earnings per share rise and the p.e remains the same. By the end of the 10-year period, the eps will have more than doubled from $10 to $25.8 and the share price will have risen to $258, earning Fred Futile $158m for himself. But the company isn't really more valuable, it's just more geared*.

If you are not convinced by that example, here is another one. Smith uses the real life example of Pepsi which bought back almost $5 billion of its shares in 2008. This strategy enhanced its eps (albeit in the sense of lessening an eps fall). But what would have happened had Pepsi used the same money to buy shares in Coke, which had a similar p/e ratio to Pepsi? Then the accounting treatment would have changed; instead of reducing the number of shares in issue, the investments on Pepsi's balance sheet would have grown. The eps would not have been bolstered by this approach; more significantly, the return on equity would have fallen.

That is because Pepsi earned a return on equity of 34%. Buying shares in Coke (or itself) on a p/e of around 20 is, in effect, generating a return of just 5% (the earnings yield is the inverse of the p/e). In short, such a purchase destroys value.

Perhaps this is more obvious when one considers a common reason for buy-backs; to mop-up the shares created by option issuance. Executives wouldn't be exercising their options unless they were going to make a profit. So companies are selling shares to executives at a low price and buying them back at a higher one.

This buy high, sell low policy is symbolic of the buy-back era. run a graph (as Smith does) of the S&P 500 against buy-back activity and you will see that activity goes up and down with the market. Executives are not bargain-hunters, except on their own account.

But isn't there evidence that companies that experience buy-backs outperform the market? Yes there is, but Smith has a useful caveat. This outperformance is concentrated in the value stocks, those with the lowest price-to-book value. if the company can buy its shares back below book value, then that is indeed a good deal.

Share buy-backs should only be used if the stock is trading at below its economic value and the repurchase represents the best use of cash availableYou cannot create value by buying back overvalued sharesCompanies should be required to justify the price and returns on repurchases as they would on acquisitions or other investmentsShares repurchased should be left on the balance sheet as an asset and equity accounted. 

* Corporate finance theory would suggests the rating should fall as the company gets more risky. But it may well not fa",2024-01-24 13:19:41,2024-02-26 20:29:56.495946,33 days 07:10:15.495946,30,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19egx14/the_buyback_delusion_how_accounting_deludes/
