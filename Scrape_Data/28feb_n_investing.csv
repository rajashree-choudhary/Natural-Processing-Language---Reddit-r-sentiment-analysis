1b2cukn,investing,Roth Contributions Vs Employee Pretax,"Hey all, I need some guidance when it comes to decision making for my financial future. 

I am 21 years old and work for a tech company as an Account Executive. I have 0 debt and own my car, absolutely no monthly payments besides rent. Last year I made roughly $75,000, this year I should make around $90,000, and so on and so forth I should be in the six figure range. I come to y’all asking if I should be allocating my company 401K match to pretax, or Roth contributions. My company offers an awesome 5% match, which I have been taking advantage of but I currently am allocating the same % to pretax and Roth, and I am realizing that might not be the most optimal solution for me. I should also mention that I hope to retire early.

I was looking in to corporate bonds and I see some that have 12% yield and don’t really understand where/how that calculated by my broker.

Principal: 991.60
Accrued intrest:19.78
Fee:3.50
Total cost: $1,014.88

My understanding would be I would get 1000+19.78 when the bond is due and that is like .03% not 12%

1b2931z,investing,Taking profits and re-investing inside tax advantage accounts when the funds go low again?,"This falls inside 'time the market' I am sure but really just looking for advice. 

This also falls into the crypto landscape as I invested 2 years ago into GBTC (inside Fidelity) and was long on BTC anyways...so when the news came out about the ETFs, I felt optimistic. It paid off...and the ETFs were approved.  I ended up selling at a small 'loss' the GBTC inside my ROTH IRA because I wanted to jump into FBTC (fidelity's version) due to low fees (0 until August, then 0.25% after) vs GBTC at 1.5%.   

So I got into GBTC at a basis of around $47...and got out around $42 I think, probably a 'loss' of about $2500. Because these ETFs are btc index funds, it's still all relative of value.  I then took the sold amount and put it into FBTC at a basis of $36. It's currently $53, so I am up about $5k since mid January. 

This also goes for ARKB (+$500) and MSTR (+$630).  Now, I am long on BTC...so with THAT being my mindset...am I better off just letting things be, even if there is a predicted correction that I feel confident is coming before the April halving (which is expected to cause the price to go up quite a bit)...or is this a scenario since I'm in a tax advantaged account that I should go ahead and grab my small profit and dump it back in when the correction happens? Of course...maybe that doesn't happen...and this just goes up and up (I just find that unlikely short term).",2024-02-28 15:44:13,2024-02-28 20:00:58.569529,0 days 04:16:45.569529,2,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b2931z/taking_profits_and_reinvesting_inside_tax/

1b1mpq5,investing,Stock Market Hasn’t Been This Hot in Decades. Is the Rally Justified?,"This is mostly a straight copy paste from a Barron’s article. I’ve been reading a lot more noise from the financial press about overheated values. So I tend to peruse the articles that give multiple sides or data supporting their claims.

There are lots of Nvidia mentions, of course. But pretty much any pan market analysis is going to mention Nvidia.

From Barron’s:

https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-hottest-decades-1ca7bcf5

> The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary few months, any way you slice it. The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.”

> The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971.

> Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble

> Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect

> And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.”

> Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [**really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm**]

The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots.

But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical.

Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it.

Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now.

But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.

1b1lcxt,investing,Warren Buffett is not fond of how the markets have started to resemble a casino,"“For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young,” he wrote in his annual shareholder letter.

The reality is that the stock market has always been and remains a money game.

Even if someone considers themselves an investor who, before buying a stock (and holding it for years), thoroughly examines the company's business, management quality, macroeconomic environment, and all that, they are still placing a bet.

A bet that the published results are accurate, unambiguous, and won't drastically change in the future, that the quality and motivation of the management will remain unchanged over a year, two, or five, etc.

Purchasing growth stocks is, by nature, a gamble.

Buffett's advice to speculators is undoubtedly wise: Remember who is really making money from your gambling—the House.

However, the simplicity and accessibility of market operations, which dismay the Maestro, have radically cheapened them. In his younger days, commissions were so high it's debatable when the House earned more, especially in relative terms.

1b1go5k,investing,Reddit files their S1 and is set for IPO,"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…

\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”

\- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe).

I'm 100% sure that there will be no rate cuts in March at this point. And I honestly wouldn't be shocked personally if they just did nothing until after the election cycle here in the US. If something breaks, maybe they will cut rates - but right now things are ""fine"" - GDP actually increased with the PPI data today, jobless claims remain at record lows - so the economic situation screams that they can actually hike rates more if they have to.

So why do so many people say ""well they said they would cut rates"" when the market is saying that there is no reason to cut rates this year?

Take for example today with NVDA - on the market open I made several short sale trades with say 2 to 5 shares. No problem. Price kept dropping. Profit. Was up about $75 to $100 about 15 minutes / 6 trades in - all profiting trades. Then I decided hell, why not try shorting 33 shares. OOF - price rose $6 in 3 minutes and I had to cover to prevent further losses. Blew through all the profits I made and then some.

It's seriously as if market makers see people who are getting greedy and purposely price them out of the market, like the whole thing is a freaking game.

1b18zxx,investing,"Citi's research, outlining their view that S&P 500 is not in a bubble.","Overall, the year-to-date surge of nearly 7% in the S&P 500 increases the necessity for fundamental growth factors to materialize and sustain the market's movement, Citi added. Essentially, investors are advancing funds based on anticipated future earnings growth. We remain confident in this, but need to recognize that much has quickly been priced in. While the index may overshoot our year-end 5100 target in the short term, it seems premature to increase the probability of our 5700 bull case scenario, strategists led by Scott T. Chronert said.

  
That scenario reflects a goldilocks macro and 22x a $260 index earnings projection (vs our base case $245 estimate). For now, we remain constructive on SP 500 fundamentals, but prefer to buy pullbacks, they added. Citi also responded to recent parallels drawn between the current bull market and the tech bubble, pointing out that today's valuation multiples are significantly lower than those seen in 1999-2000.

  
From their perspective, the strategists think that the underlying fundamentals of the market have markedly changed, distinguishing the current situation from that of the late '90s. That said, the current spending ramp on gen AI infrastructure and product will need to translate to incremental revenue and growth drivers. But it is premature to judge that, Chronert and his team commented.

  
Moreover, Citi previously said that market broadening is crucial for reaching new index peaks. While it's true that a handful of mega-cap companies have significantly propelled the S&P 500 to new highs, contributing to about half of the index's gains, there's also been a significant rise in the number of stocks reaching 52-week highs, Citi highlighted.",2024-02-27 10:47:51,2024-02-28 20:00:58.569836,1 days 09:13:07.569836,61,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b18zxx/citis_research_outlining_their_view_that_sp_500/

&#x200B;

I'm relatively new to financial diversification and despite the loads of time I've poured into educating myself, I still feel a little lost. For initial context, I'm 34, I make around $85k/year (not salaried).

&#x200B;

About six months ago I opened an automated investment account with Wealthfront. My risk tolerance is set at an 8.0 out of 10. On the first of every month, $1k is deposited into the account from my checking account. To date I've put $12k into the account. My portfolio breaks down as follows:

&#x200B;

**45% US Stocks (VTI & ITOT)**

&#x200B;

**15% Municipal Bonds (VTEB & MUB)**

&#x200B;

**15% Emerging Market Stocks (VWO & IEMG)**

&#x200B;

**15% Foreign Developed Stocks (SCHF)**

&#x200B;

**9% Dividend Growth Stocks (VIG)**

&#x200B;

Accrued market discount is specified on box 1f, which brings an adjustment negating all capital gains, and requires reporting the gains as interest on Schedule B. (see Worksheet for Accrued Market Discount Adjustment in Column in Form 8949 instructions)

&#x200B;

Fidelity sent me this 1099-B for a treasury note I bought on the secondary market, and held for just over a year until maturity:

See the 1099: [https://imgur.com/a/exUWih3](https://imgur.com/a/exUWih3)

Here's a [link](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2016/A_20160922_2.pdf) to the original treasury announcement for this note (but again: I bought it on the secondary market, in 2022).

I'm surprised to see it categorized as long term capital gains on the 1099 - I expected interest income. I don't think the de minimis rule applies here given the discount amount, so I don't understand the reason.

To be clear this is good news for me I'm in the top tax bracket, so without taking NIIT into account I get 20% LTCG taxation instead of 37% (no state taxes). So I'm not complaining, but it seems I don't actually understand how it works.

Fidelity says (in the ""Features & Benefits"" tab): [https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds](https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds)

>When a bond is purchased at market discount and held until maturity, the market discount is treated as interest income.

This is exactly my case, except on the 1099-B we can see the market discount categorized as capital gain. So this doesn't make sense to me to all.

The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.) That‘s a lot of exposure to tech.

The EV landscape has gone from great to shitshow in the last 6 months as the entire supply chain (from automakers to mines) is struggling due to lackluster EV sales.

Likely, the EV boom will become a hybrid boom as predicted by Toyota. I think lithium as a commodity will struggle for a few more months but will eventually find a stale floor price.

My long term bet is that upstream lithium (mines, refineries,) will continue to consolidate at a rapid rate and the lithium supply chain will tighten as a result. SQM and Albemarle are having a field day right now picking up strategic acquisitions for pennies on the dollar (I'm accumulating both).

My high multiple lithium stock bet is a junior miner sitting on top of one of the largest lithium reserves in North America ($LIFT).

1b0qttn,investing,Backtesting 25 years of leveraged ETFs with Moving Averages,"[Screenshot of results](https://i.imgur.com/3Vxh7XD.png)

Hi, I want to share how anyone can easily backtest LETFs up to 1999 on PortfolioVisualizer. The reason is I haven't seen this method posted anywhere, my assumption is most are unaware of other tickers besides the classic UPRO or TQQQ.

Normally, the standard way is to create your own sim data which you import to PV. Pros: you can go back a lot further. Cons: prone to error if lacking knowledge, it requires a subscription plan, unable to publicly share their PV link (as we will do below).

The inception dates for the most popular LETFs are \~2010 for 3x (UPRO, TQQQ) and 2006 for 2x (SSO, QLD). We can accurately ""extend"" them by using these funds with inception date 1999:

* **ULPIX: 2x S&P 500**
* **UOPIX: 2x Nasdaq-100**

Then to simulate their 3x counterpart we apply 1.5x Leverage on them. We can check for consistency comparing them to UPRO and TQQQ, metrics should be close to identical:

* [UPRO vs 1.5x ULPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=e9Ww2XytVpITO3aDg6Q22)
* [TQQQ vs 1.5x UOPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=2tyAOeTrDXjMNI59YEVWg9)

Now all the PV links for the data I extracted in the screenshot (Buy & Hold vs MA):

* [S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6hdJviUxLkTKjsjY0X59gR)
* [2x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=1VzljcRe9xxCBcrh7VFhVQ)
* [3x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=5rGWFUe9SGd5gN2Huz2PN6)
* [Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6I1EZMO0waRp5YOCtxKeDr)
* [2x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=7GsHtE6iQHRfXS97sOxCeR)
* [3x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=OGx3xyCH9eMOMtFWSvNyI)

My belief is 1999 is actually a great time to start backtesting LETFs as a minimum timeframe since we capture the 3 highest stress periods in the modern era (dotcom, subprime, pandemic) and as shown this can be easily achieved on PV by everyone.

Also 1999 proved quite terrible timing to lump sum into a LETF but I think this adds value to the analysis, as it emphasizes the catastrophic effect of drawdowns and hopefully tames the euphoria usually carried around LETF gains. They absolutely require a hedge to strive in the long-run regardless if lumpsum or DCA.

Which brings me to the last point - a way to mitigate this is by trading around a long Moving Average, which is why I included the strategy in the analysis. Not much to say here, this topic is already thoroughly discussed and backtested, worth checking:

* [Trend Following In Financial Markets](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/01/movingaverage/)
* [Leveraged SMA200 Strategy Back-tested 1929-2019](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=297591)
* [Leverage for the Long Run](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)
* [Using S&P 200-day moving average as volatility forecaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LETFs/comments/mfugvt/trading_letfs_upro_tqqq_etc_using_sp_200day/)

Only a few comments from my side regarding MA:

* Use the S&P 500 as signal even if you trade leveraged Nasdaq-100, the former is broader and a better market volatility indicator. Never trade based on the LETF crossovers, that is a costly mistake.
* Always trade at signal. Some use monthly due to superior results in certain backtests but those rely on timing luck, e.g. for the Covid crash you just so happened to go under the MA in the last days of February exactly when making the monthly trade, had this occurred a couple of days later March would have crushed your leveraged portfolio until your next monthly trade (>50% loss in UPRO)
* Most of the MA trades are unprofitable short-term whipsaws, this can be painful but normal and expected. It's the cost needed to make the strategy perform, a minority of highly profitable trades entirely make up for it and place you well ahead of a Buy & Hold on all risk metrics.
* You will notice I used the 12-months SMA (252 days). Also discussed in the above links, S&P 500 backtests since 1929 show nearly identical results on all metrics between 200<->250 SMA, so just use \~250 because this improves on the number of signals and whipsaws. For example in the period I backtested above there are 143 trades, if we change the Lookback Period to 9 months (189 days) we get 201 trades, an unnecessary 40% increase (this can be checked under ""Model Trades"" in my PV links)
* I also wrote a simple TradingView script to illustrate every 250-day signal, just add it on your SPX chart: [tradingview.com/script/lwFiJxKB](https://www.tradingview.com/script/lwFiJxKB-Moving-Average-250-day-Strategy/)

Hope this can provide value to someone, good luck!",2024-02-26 19:51:07,2024-02-28 20:00:58.569965,2 days 00:09:51.569965,4,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b0qttn/backtesting_25_years_of_leveraged_etfs_with/

My only concern on the short term is a series of mass layoffs which will make many people live without insurance, or the US reforming the healthcare system in a way that hurts companies.

1b0mfd0,investing,Compounding Interest Difference Eventually Stuck At Specific Percent Difference,"Apologies ahead of time as I am not sure if my wording is sufficient and I am also not someone with a finance or math background professionally. I do enjoy investing on the side and like learning about personal finance in general. I found myself trying to compare something someone posted about on IG asking people if they'd prefer getting $6k a week for life or $5 million right now. 

At a certain point of comparison, I tried comparing them to see how it would look if you invested both incomes at 10% YoY with no taxable income/dividends to control for. Strictly just 10% YoY value growth. 

So using [this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.htm), I tried to see how each one would look with this return over the course of various time periods (12.5 years, 25, 50, etc.). I figured at SOME point the $6k a week income would eventually start to return more than the initial one, (even if like hundreds of years into the future haha), because of a combination of compounding and consistent, continuous investments as opposed to a one time lump sum investment. 

So after 12.5 years, the difference between the two scenarios was like 72%. 

At 25 years it was around 32.5%.

At 50 years it was around 21.25%.

I seem to have encountered a conundrum where at around 70 years, the % difference between the first and second scenario becomes about 20.2% and then as I increment the time periods it seems to stay constant. I've tried up to 400 years and it's sitting at 20.2%.

I think my math for calculating the % difference is correct.

(Scenario A - Scenario B) / Scenario B

Is it maybe some limitation with the calculator I am using? If not, what is this phenomenon called? Why is 20.2% the final coefficient (if that's the right terminology). This also leads me to believe in some combination where the two types of contribution types will eventually meet in the middle and then rise evenly from then on?  

Again, apologies if this is something obvious to investment/math professionals that I am unaware of but I couldn't find out too much online or with ChatGPT (could also have to do with my wording) and I am just trying to learn more.",2024-02-26 16:58:01,2024-02-28 20:00:58.570019,2 days 03:02:57.570019,5,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b0mfd0/compounding_interest_difference_eventually_stuck/

Despite reassurances from many friends that Rivian was the future, I bought in at $21. However, I never anticipated losing 50 percent of my investment so rapidly. I had set up a stop-loss order to trigger if the stock lost 50 percent of its value.

Thoughts?","I recently made a £230,482 return on investment from an investment solution I initiated a few months ago, primarily focusing on trading. While I'm thrilled with the outcome, I'm unsure if it was just luck or if there's a solid strategy at play.

Having invested approximately £100k in stocks, I'm now contemplating diversifying into real estate by acquiring an investment property. With interest rates on the rise, I'm curious about the viability of property investment amidst these conditions.

Specifically, my questions are:

1. Given the current trend of increasing interest rates, what is your perspective on investing in property? Is it a potential disaster waiting to happen?

2. For those who own negatively geared properties, have you opted to increase rent to mitigate losses or address the changing market conditions?",2024-02-26 04:03:08,2024-02-28 20:00:59.708610,2 days 15:57:51.708610,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b089qm/seeking_advice_230482_roi_considering_property/
1b082kc,investing,What is the point of bonds when you can use CDs?,"I always hear people throw out the idea of a 60/40 portfolio especially as you get older near 45 or 50 & up, but I never understood what the exact point of this is. Bonds behave similar to stocks, when a stock market crash happens like 2022, 2020, 2008 - bonds can get hit just as hard as stocks. Well maybe not quite as hard, but you still lose money if you have 40% of your portfolio in bonds or even if you had 100% of your portfolio in bonds. 

&#x200B;

And for that case most dividend stocks would take a hit too unless it's something that's not directly invested in stocks like JEPI or other derivative based products. Bitcoin got hit pretty hard in the 2020 and 2022 crashes as well, so crypto isn't safe. 

&#x200B;

But CDs - Certificates of Deposts. They are FDIC insured to 250k per account, and if you use Fidelity they can be deposit swept up to 1 million in FDIC insurance. They yield 5.0% to 5.7%, which is better than most bond portfolios over time have yielded, and just 1% off the average return of my wife's Edward Jones portfolio and 2-3% off the average return of the S&P 500. 

&#x200B;

And Certificates of Deposit have ZERO RISK OF DIPPING IN VALUE! Your funds can be locked up, but if this is a retirement strategy, that's actually what you want - you won't be touching it until you retire anyways.

&#x200B;

So are bonds useless if you can put CDs in your Roth IRA? There is no tax advantage what so ever to anything in a Roth as it's all taxed already. If you're in a Traditional IRA, dividends and yield basically are taxed as income anyway so no real advantage either way. So I just don't get why people use bonds if they have the option to balance their portfolio at all.",2024-02-26 03:52:46,2024-02-28 20:00:59.708617,2 days 16:08:13.708618,92,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b082kc/what_is_the_point_of_bonds_when_you_can_use_cds/

1azx4nh,investing,Seeking Insights: Apartment Building vs. Strip Mall Investment in Suburban Growth Area,"I'm contemplating between two real estate investments: a 30-50-unit apartment building at $1,500 rent per unit or a strip mall with 7-12 units, leasing at $15-20/sqft/year for 2,000 sqft spaces. The location is a suburban area near a metropolitan hub, with a growing population.  
I'm looking for your wisdom on a few fronts:  
Profitability: Which type of investment has shown better returns in similar markets? Considerations include construction costs, operating expenses, and income potential.  
Experiences: If you've tackled similar projects, what challenges did you face, and what strategies led to success?  
Market and Location: How do local conditions sway your choice between residential and commercial real estate? What location characteristics are key for success?  
Financing and Taxes: Any advice on handling financing terms and tax implications for such investments?

Goldman Sachs Research raised its target for the S&P 500 Index for year-end 2024 from 5,100 to 5,200, representing a gain of 4% from the index's level on February 16. The higher forecast reflects Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin's expectations for stronger economic growth and higher profits from the information technology and communication services sector.

1aztgxv,investing,Need advice on my planned strategy.,"I have a lump sum for me to invest into growth products. However, I am quite conservative in investing, and my risk tolerance is low to moderate so I will just do normal etfs and bonds instead of leverage, options or forex, so that I can sleep well during the night. I have made two simple plans that I hope experienced people who have been through high and low in the market can share their thoughts of and give me logical and practical advice, including why they are good or bad plans.

Here is my first plan:

All in TLT. And when the government is going to drop the interest rate, the price will go up, then I will sell it to get capital gain between 15% to 40% based on the historical data, and if the unlikely recession will ever happens, the gain can be even more.

After that, if the market is still hot and unpredictable, I will do fractional share reinvestment with DCA:

25% SCHG
20% Nvdia (stock) or SMH
20% XLK
20% VT
15% Inda

Then in the future, when the stock market is will drop, I will invest the lump sum into them with the same percentage. And maybe one day, when technology is not the driver of the stock market anymore, I can replace technology ETFs with a new sector.

The second plan is to start DCA now, so I don’t waste time while waiting for that capital gain of TLT. 

Please give me some advice and if you think I should alter my planned portfolio.",2024-02-25 17:28:46,2024-02-28 20:00:59.708708,3 days 02:32:13.708709,24,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aztgxv/need_advice_on_my_planned_strategy/
1azt786,investing,Number of customers versus number of accounts at big investment firms ... overstated?,"I'm not sure if this is on topic for this /sr but I wonder if anyone can help,

I'm interested in how many customers or households have accounts at the big U.S. investment firms (like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard).

Folks in this /sr are obviously attuned to investing. But when you consider the entirety of the U.S. population - all the grandmas and folks living paycheck to paycheck and folks new to the U.S. and the fraction of households where concepts like index funds and investing just never were any part of family conversation - I think that a good fraction of the U.S. simply doesn't think of or do any investing. (At least not directly; their employer may sock away money in a 401k for them, but they don't actively manage it or have a personal account where they do their own investing.)

In particular, I'd venture that **less than half of U.S. households have a personal investment account** where they can (and do) buy/sell stocks, index funds, ETFs, etc. (Separate from, e.g., a 401(k) their employers might have made for them ... I mean an account they personally actively made and trade with.)

Where am I going with all this? Let's look at some numbers:

* [The FDIC says](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/index.html) there are \~108 M ""fully banked"" households in the U.S.
* [This recent Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/vanguard-vs-fidelity-4587961) says Vanguard has over 30 M and Fidelity over 43 M ""individual investors""
* [This recent Schwab press release](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2023/Schwab-Reports-Monthly-Activity-Highlights-db1d3b14b/default.aspx) says it has 34 M active brokerage accounts

That's a total of 107 M investment investors and/or accounts (Vanguard 30 + Fidelity 43 + Schwab 34)

Whereas the U.S. has, at most, \~108 M households with bank accounts.

And this 107 only counts three big investment firms when there are [many others](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/largest-stock-brokerage-firms/).

There's just no way that every household in the U.S. that has any bank account, also has a separate investing account they're active in (past their employer's retirement account).

So what exactly is being counted here?

I don't doubt that the counts above (30 to 40 M per firm) are accurate somehow. But ... *how*?

Could this explain it: I personally have a lot going on with a big investing firm. I have a taxable (joint with wife), a Roth IRA, and a Traditional IRA. Also my parents passed, leaving an Inherited set of the same (that's six accounts so far). Then my wife also has her own separate taxable, Roth, and Trad. IRA with that same firm.

So we are one household... but it would also be accurate to say we have nine accounts. (But note that the Investopedia article specifically says *individual investors*, not *accounts.)*

So I guess the bottom line I'm driving at here is: What **percent of households have at least one investment account**, and a direct account at that? (One they actively established and use, separate from any employer retirement accounts)

Where can one find numbers like that, and what would they be called?

But more importantly, is there a way to see this particular number for the big investment firms? (customers or households, NOT ""accounts"")

Something's not right when there's a clear impression that firms' numbers add up to way more investors in the U.S. than even have bank accounts!

I hope this is making sense. Thank you for bearing with me! I appreciate it if you can shed any light on these huge numbers.

**EDIT** a couple of hours after the above OP:

Thanks to you folks responding, I see I need to look deeper. I came across [this FINRA National Financial Capability Study](https://www.finrafoundation.org/knowledge-we-gain-share/nfcs/data-and-downloads)'s 2021 Investor Survey Report, which says (p. 3): ""In 2021, just over a third (**35 percent**) of the national population had investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other securities outside of retirement accounts. There has been a slight upward trend in the percentage of investors since 2015.""

1azsb38,investing,How can I benefit from the rapid growth and new developments in our area? ,"Part of an area I live in was once considered less desirable, but over the last 10 to 15 years, it's really started to come alive. We've seen a wave of new developments like apartments and small business buildings offering space for dental clinics, gyms, food parks, and more. This has opened up services that weren't available here before.

Many customers of the said businesses are students from a nearby private school, who tend to be from wealthier families, and employees from a small corporate office. With more apartments being built, I anticipate an increase in potential customers.

I expect these developments to continue in maybe for the next 10+ years and fortunately my house is just around of all these developments, which has me thinking about how I can make the most of these opportunities. I'm in my early 20s and planning for my future, so I'm not in a rush but thinking about possibilities for the next five years or so.

One idea I had was to open a pet supplies store, as there isn't one nearby yet. The number of pet owners are still growing, especially with more couples choosing not to have children. Another, perhaps safer, option might be to invest in rental properties, although I'd need to save up a bit more to get started.

1azruol,investing,Leveraging Real Estate to reduce Sequence of Return Risk.,"My Portfolio is 95% FNILX and I'd like to keep it that way more or less well into retirement.

I plan to retire with about 2 Million dollars in my portfolio.

I'm not so well-off that I don't have sequence risk though, especially if we're talking about the 1st couple years after retirement, or the year before retirement. My expected withdrawal rate in the first 5 years of retirement is 5 or 5.5%, at which point I reach social security age and withdrawal rate drops down to 3 to 4%.

I'm planning to use the roughly 600k in Home equity I have to bridge this risk. By either refinancing the home, pulling a heloc, a sale, or a number of other ways based on what is most appropriate at that time. If the market takes a big enough crap in this very key year-range.

What I'm curious is... I've seen some numbers tossed around like.. 'the market has a XX% dip every XX many years' and 'the market tends to rebound within xx timeframe' . I am curious if a table or mathematical formula for ... let's say 'buying the dip' exists in relation to sequence risk in retirement.

Example: "" If the market goes down 10%, I will...    "" vs. 15% or 20%, etc etc.

My thought process had been, a 10% hit to the market and I might utilize a Heloc for a years worth of spending, if the market takes a 20% hit I might refinance the home, take 18 months of living expenses as cash, and add the rest of my equity to the portfolio to buy the dip. But these are just vague, feelings-based numbers I pulled off the top of my head.

I am wondering if anyone or any webpage has mathed this out extensively because I would be very interested in seeing that data and where my real numbers should be for these decisions. It would kind of be similar to the probabilities involved in 'buying the dip' so if you have some great math on that topic you think would be helpful I would be interested in reading that as well.

Thank you for any replies.",2024-02-25 16:23:16,2024-02-28 20:00:59.708726,3 days 03:37:43.708726,11,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azruol/leveraging_real_estate_to_reduce_sequence_of/
1aznz5f,investing,"Has Anyone Successfully Managed a DIY Systematic, Non-Emotional Investing Strategy? ","
I'm venturing into the realm of systematic investing and am intrigued by the concept of factor-based portfolios. The idea of removing emotion from investing and relying on a predefined system or equation to guide stock selection and allocation decisions seems both challenging and rewarding.

I'm curious to learn from those who have walked this path:

1. Success Stories: Have you created and successfully managed a factor-based portfolio? I'd love to hear about your strategy, the factors you prioritize (e.g., value, momentum, quality, etc.), and how you've refined your approach over time.

2. Challenges:  Were there any unexpected hurdles in sticking to a systematic approach?

3. Tools and Platforms: This is a big one for me. Which trading platforms do you find most conducive to executing and managing a systematic portfolio? I’ve been using IKBR and I'm looking for platforms that offer flexibility, robust analytical tools, and perhaps automation capabilities to streamline the process.

4. Advice for Beginners: For someone just starting their journey in systematic, non-emotional investing, what advice would you give? Any resources, books, or courses that you found invaluable?

5. Portfolio Management: How do you manage portfolio rebalancing, risk management, and keep your strategy aligned with your investment goals?

 I'm here to learn from your journeys, insights, and perhaps even your mistakes.

Thank you in advance for sharing your wisdom

However, I am not sure how I would implement factors in an all-world portfolio. Say I have a 100% VWCE portfolio now, how would you start to complement it with different factor indices? I was thinking about going a 70/30 route, but instead of making it about Wolrd/EM, making it All-World/factors. One possiblity would be to add different world factor ETFs. Say an MSCI World value, quality, small cap and momentum ETF in a, say, 10/10/5/5 ratio. Another possiblity I thought about is using an equal weighted world ETF. The equal weighted S&P 500 has historically (going back decades, not just the recent past) outperformed the market weighted ETF, so using an equal weighted world ETF seems to make sense instead of the VWCE world. Here a ratio of 70/30 with factors seems reasonable to me as well. Does anyone here run a similar equity portfolio to this? I ran it through Morningstars x-ray and it looked promising.

1azdmrw,investing,I Bonds as the best safe asset for tax purposes?,"While most of my portfolio is in VT, having some portion in a safe inflation protected asset is appealing. I'm thinking I Bonds might be the best way to go (simply buy the max every year, forever).  
  
My understanding is that in general people are lukewarm on I Bonds because TIPS or HYSA or money market funds can provide higher returns and be more flexible. However, I'm not so sure this is true for my circumstance for a few reasons.  
  
(1) I Bonds are state/local tax free. I have an over 10% state + local tax rate now, so this is meaningful. Some other assets also have this property, but I don't right now know of any others which also have....  
  
(2) You can defer paying tax until redeeming. Right now my marginal tax rate is near 50%. So I make 5% on a HYSA and lose half of it. But in theory if I just hold the I Bonds until retirement (where my income will certainly be way way lower) then I will pay significantly less tax on the interest then I would along the way via HYSA/tips/money market etc.  
  
So my questions are: Does anything else also have the combo property of (1) and (2)? Or even just (2)...  
  
And is this actually likely to be worth the difference in returns compared to other safe options? Understood if it's sort of impossible to know but would appreciate some input.

1azcfte,investing,Roll overs and self management,"Okay there's a few different things in here so I'll try my best to lay it all out.

Current situation:

\- 5% of my income goes in a trad 401k for the company match

\-  I use a trad IRA to backdoor in a Roth IRA every year

\- I invest some extra in a taxable account

&#x200B;

First question is that I want to roll over my 401k every 2 months and self manage in my trad IRA. I do not plan to backdoor these contributions because it's going to increase my tax burden and I'd rather defer some taxation for now. By doing this, does it impact my annual contribution to the trad IRA that I then roll over to a Roth? I'm not sure how the pro rata rule factors in here if at all.

My second question, is I have the option to also participate in a Roth 401k. For this scenario I'm assuming my entire match is for the trad contribution, so I could just roll over some extra capital into my Roth IRA every month. However if I decide I want the Roth contributions matched and I roll over, what tax consequences could I be looking at? If I ever wanted to withdraw the 'contributions' from the Roth IRA are matches considered gains or contributions?

Basically I want to self manage my 401k by rolling it into my IRAs and want to figure out the most efficient and least tax consequential method of doing so. I want to add a Roth 401k contribution to roll over and not sure which one to add the company match on.

","The bubble will pop.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

1az8jex,investing,What are ways you have invested in your home that have yielded the highest annual ROI?,"Here are the big ones for me:

* Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high.
* Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more.
* All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights.
* Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.

The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.

I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.

1az86v6,investing,"IBKR offers good value, even in a scenario with lower interest rates","Interactive Brokers is a low-cost electronic brokerage. 74.6% of the company is held by its founder Thomas Jefferffy, leaving only about 25.4% of the company as free float in the market.  
  
The company went public in 2007 being mainly a market maker for options. As the market-making business declined, IBKR pivoted toward automatic electronic brokerage, selling the market-maker part of the business. Since then, the company has steadily increased users and equity from users.  
  
Given that they’re a low-cost provider of brokerage, highly focused on technology and automatization, their net margins are really high. That’s why, if they focus on growth, it will translate into the net margins straight away.  
  
  
  
Dividend? Buybacks? Nah  
  
  
  
The company has stated in its earnings call for Q4 2023 that increasing dividends or buying back shares are unlikely to happen. They are accumulating earnings to grow, most likely through an acquisition.  
  
The company is relentlessly focused on growth. As they don’t think that paying more dividends or buying back shares will increase the growth of the company in the long run, they will not do it. Instead, they’re scrutinizing the market to acquire a competitor. That would mean instant growth both in revenues and net margin. However, we’ve widely seen how acquisitions all over the world, and in all industries, usually destroy value. Of course, it all depends on the discipline and patience of the management team to not rush on a deal because they have the money in their hands.  
  
The future is uncertain, though. And although I’m sure that acquiring a competitor may excite the market, it may not be the best way to go. Anyway, they operate in a great industry, with good margins. So maybe declining interest rates give them an opportunity to acquire a good business at a good price.  
  
INTRINSIC VALUE OF IBKR  
  
There is a margin of safety if we estimate that the interest rates will go down to 2%. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the margin of safety is wide.  
  
Assuming the above, the normalized net profit for the company would be sitting at $1.812M. This would mean a total market value of $49.249M, or said otherwise, a 15.68% margin of safety compared to today’s price (February 16th, 2024). For this company, given its quality, growth, and earnings visibility, I have found fair a PE ratio of 27.18 times. The required margin of safety for this company would be 12.54%, which makes IBKR a buy today. Please refer to the PE calculation at the end of the document for further details.  
  
Note about the interest rates and the normalized net profit. The company stated in the Q4 2023 conference call that every 25 basis points decrease in the benchmark would result in a $56M reduction in net income. Thus, this would mean a reduction of $784M, in line with our normalized net profit.  
  
However, the company has stated that they will be pursuing an acquisition. I haven’t accounted for the excess cash as part of the base (normalized) valuation since the management is not giving it back to shareholders. But they will be pursuing an acquisition. Assuming that they won’t allocate all their excess cash to this acquisition (they have stated that they will pursue a payment based on cash and stocks), I think that a probable scenario would be a $7B acquisition. Assuming a poor return on the acquisition of 5% net profit, that would add $350M in net profits to the company. Assuming the same PE as before, the margin of safety would increase to 38.03%. All of this, assuming lower interest rates.  
  
I consider the current M.O.S. compelling enough to invest in the company. There’s plenty of upside while the downside of the investment looks reduced. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the share price won’t fall, especially if interest rates start declining, but it won’t be a decrease in value. Rather, it would represent an outstanding investment opportunity. However, the fact that the company is not willing to buy back shares or increase its dividend is also worth noting. I don’t think that the company will waste its money on acquisitions since the management has stated that they have refused two potential acquisitions due to price discrepancies. But if they do, we should revisit the assumptions made to give IBKR a PE ratio of 27 times.

1az7xcd,investing,Early Retirement Advice Needed,"I'm 40 years old and I'm cautiously optimistic that I can retire early, like in 5 years. Or at least drastically cut hours working.

 I've been planning for it for a decade and have been investing heavily with this in mind, both in index funds and more risky individual stocks. (I'm ok with high risk, high reward as it gets me closer to this goal, and if it doesn't work, then i can always extend my timeline.)

I have two young children, which complicates it some. 

Here's where I'm looking for advice. 
Once investments have gotten to a comfortable number, like the 4% rule, or 25x yearly expenses, where's the best place to park all the capital?

Keep it in the same investments? Move to long term CDs? Bonds? A combination of it all? I've always been in the wealth accumulation phase, never in the preservation phase, so it is uncharted waters for me.

Quick example, say last year someone maxed their Roth IRA at $6,500. Bought whatever and had $200 leftover. 

This year say someone maxes out their Roth IRA at $7,000. Can they spend $7,200? Or does it have to be spent per year? 

I can see $7,200 triggering something negative since it’s over the $7,000 limit (if that’s someone’s max), or is it ok to spend the leftover $ from a previous year? 

If someone maxed $7k and did nothing, and maxed $7k the next year, can they spend $14k at once?

1az6v93,investing,Early Retirement Question,"My wife and I (in our late 30s) have finally crossed the $1 million mark with both our savings and retirement investments that has been cautiously and consistently funded -- And will continue to do so.

Now, I think it’s not by design, but we aren’t adventurous folks, spend on things we don’t actually want or don’t to live lavishly — hence what we’re able to achieve. We don’t have kids (Pet dog only) or are in financial/credit card debt. We don’t really go on frequent vacation.. just call us boring or “not living life.” We consider ourselves homebodies and prefer to be home 80% of the time. My wife likes to be on her phone for social media, take care of her indoor house plants, cooks and bakes, and watches her trash shows. And I’m more technology guy where I’m naturally sitting and in front of the computer monitor either gaming, web browsing, and working on creative projects (And workout and do cardio).I honestly do think our habits and view on “living life” will finally change when we’re really comfortable and well-prepared financially for our retirement — which we’re planning an early retirement in our late-50s.

Are we approaching this correctly where we aren't enjoying ourselves as much now? Or, reap the rewards in our retirement but will be older versions of ourselves where we could have enjoyed things when we were a bit younger? We think there's no problem with the latter, but some on here do. Just wanted to see if there are those in a similar situation as ours.

1az1tt0,investing,Looking for advice regarding 529 vs. investing for my son.,"So, I was going to open a 529 account for my 4yr old today, but then I thought back and recalled someone speaking about perhaps just strictly investing (S&P500 only perhaps?) for their kids and not using a 529. Perhaps I'm misremembering or misconstruing the original post I read though, but I believe it was basically stressing that kids would be better off with parents going the investing route.

My two stepsons both have Greenlight accounts and 529 accounts. Their mom makes occasional investments for them long-term through Greenlight on certain stocks, and they can use their Greenlight cards for purchasing things occasionally with approval. I'm trying to start a game plan for my 4 year old.

&#x200B;

* 529 route limits spending to educational purposes and living, correct?
   * Upside: Tax free for college spending.
   * Downside: Limited to college spending. Low interest rate.
* Investing (perhaps just S&P500?), would be more lucrative and perhaps pan out better? 
   * Upside: Earn more money off of the investments after taxes vs. tax free 529. Can spend anywhere as needed once cashed out.
   * Downside: Taxed whenever deciding to sell. Can lose money on investments if buying into the wrong choices or a market crash.

 We literally have the FED chairman whispering to the markets every couple of months,, teasing gently with rate cuts etc. 

How is it that one man wields so much control over markets that are supposed to be ""free"" and based on company performance?


All everyone ever says whether its in real life or reddit is the following ""invest in your 401k and VOO for 40 years and everything will be ok"".  

No one ever acknowledges the elephant in the room. That the markets are being propped up by stimulus, qe , unlimited debt, and the promise of rate cuts. If any of the above gets removed...401ks, housing equity,banks will drop like a rock overnight.  Its alll faith based.  Does that sound like a healthy market to you? It is a big farce. 

When i bring this up...no one ever says im wrong.  They tell me to go away and say a variation of the following : "" hey the markets only go up.  They have been calling for recession forever now,,and it never happens"" ""go away. Buy guns and ammo you weirdo""   


I dont expect the average person to know this. (Since most people dont  follow  fiscal policy closely)


But for those that know better , we have to start addressing this and start discussing how to hedge just in case the same ""buy the dip"" stradegy of the past 25 years fails.  We owe it to the future generations to be honest about whats going on in this country with the economy amd markets. We need to get our collective heads out of the sand and discuss this consistently openly and honestly.  Make it normal and remove the taboo. 

 investment subs continue to sweep this under the rug as if this isnt a glaring issue.  At what cost do we keep assett prices going up forever??? Massive inflation for your children???  

What will it take for society to stop being short-sighted and let all markets reset for the greater good of the future?

1ayr42z,investing,Nvidia's AI moat is both more and less than you might think,"Nvidia seems to be a really hot topic here with the recent AI craze so I figured I should chime in some thoughts I don't see mentioned enough or at all. *This will get a tiny bit technical.*

Nvidia's current dominance in both gaming performance and deep learning performance is undisputed. What people often overlook though is that Nvidia's cards can also be used for accelerating (among others) 1) rendering workloads (e.g. animations and effects for commercials or movies), 2) physics simulations, 3) video transcoding (maybe video content platforms?), and 4) non-deep-learning-based machine learning.

## Nvidia's moat is less than you might think

For **inference** and specifically **edge** workloads, Nvidia's moat is tiny to non-existent.

Nvidia faces competition from Google (TPUs), Intel / Apple / Snapdragon / others (AI on CPUs and SBCs), Intel / AMD (GPUs), Intel / Google / others (accelerators / compute sticks), and everyone who has any sort of custom chip. 

Various ML/AI models running on flagship phones, VR headsets, internet browsers, SBCs, and even gaming PCs (e.g. upscalers) have been running on ARM, Intel, and AMD chips for nearly a decade. Even LLMs have been receiving some love and work on getting them running on CPUs and AMD GPUs, with the smaller models (1-7B, especially aggressively-quantized ones) running somewhat decently on just CPU+RAM (e.g. 1-2 words / second on a RaspberryPi 5). 

> But is this representative of the industry? 

Well, kinda. Edge inferencing (smartphone, VR, SBCs, browser, ...) is growing and will probably continue to grow quickly. Small LLMs are also **very** relevant to large tech companies (my current employer primarily uses 7-70B models for most products, plus OpenAI / Microsoft / AWS / Anthropic integrations) for both fine-tuning and inferencing. My wider department has 10+ projects working on such LLMs and services around them. AMD GPUs for inferencing are also gaining steam with projects like vLLM adding support (Jan 2024) for ROCm.

> Wait a moment, you mentioned fine-tuning. You don't do that on a CPU or AMD GPU, right?

Correct, which brings us to...

## Nvidia's moat is more than you might think

While inferencing can happen (and does happen) anywhere (e.g. we're using non-GPU instances for quite a few workloads), **training** and **fine-tuning** *only ever happens on Nvidia GPUs*. There a few reasons for that.

First, training and fine-tuning are way more intensive (and thus require more acceleration) than other workloads, so fully leveraging Nvidia's acceleration capabilities is critical. It's not just CUDA and deep learning frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, ...). There are over 20 really popular projects that are directly based on Nvidia GPUs (e.g. TensorRT-LLM, cuFFT, cuBLAS, cudf, nvvl, ...) or only come with CUDA-support out of the box (e.g. RAPIDS, XGBoost). 

Even if/when other GPUs/accelerators fully catch up (which will take a while even when pooling AMD and community contributions), that would still not be enough. Training & fine-tuning on just one GPU is not very common anymore. Even for a smaller non-LLM model I trained early last year, I had to use 4-8 GPUs for a reasonable training completion time. For LLMs, it's even worse; you often need multiple GPUs on multiple servers and pooling them is no easy task. *And even if you implement the pooling of those GPUs in software (e.g. AMD contributes to pytorch/tensorflow), then you would still lag behind Nvidia*, simply because they have also done work for that on the hardware side (e.g. NVLink/NVSwitch, DGX/OVX systems).

Finally, inferencing. I touched on this in the previous section and mentioned that Nvidia might not be a monopoly, but that was only partially true. While inferencing with decent quality and latency can and does happen on other devices, inferencing at scale massively benefits from being done on a single place (e.g. on some cloud with Nvidia GPUs) both from a cost standpoint (resource management & economies of scale) and a latency one. Both AMD and Intel have tons of data center experience, but they just aren't there yet, and these take years to develop.

## Conclusion

Will edge inferencing eat away at Nvidia's earnings? Nah, these were mostly separated from the beginning, and disproportionate increases of edge over cloud computing are not something I'd bet on. Will people keep buying Nvidia GPUs like they do now? No idea, but large data centers (e.g. AWS, Azure, Meta) will re-cycle their GPUs every a few years to get the newest (and supported) stuff, and by the time the next cycle comes, I think the overwhelming majority of sales will still end up Nvidia's way. 2-3 cycles later? No idea, but Nvidia's sales still won't be low because supporting legacy systems is an almost-necessary thing. Is the valuation of today pricing all these in? No idea. Is AI a bubble? Nope, LLMs and prompting may or may not be, but AI (or ML) doesn't end there. The hype around AI may subside, as it has done 3-5 times in the past, but we still haven't fully exported the possibilities of the the current wave so let's not kill it too early.

1aymstx,investing,Nvidia is the ‘Magnificent One’ now — but these rivals are closing in,"I’ve been accused of being a booster for Nvidia. And I’ve definitely been posting a lot on it. But it is, according to Goldman Sachs, “the most important stock in the world.”

And we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. 

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. 

So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective. 

From MarketWatch opinion piece:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-is-the-magnificent-1-now-but-these-rivals-are-closing-in-3a382a8b?g=7cca269b-40cb-4e86-a320-c716dfd46439&mod=djem_mwnbulletin

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth.

If we’re in a bubble, as the AI doomsayers keep telling us, it’s a bubble that is pretty much encompassing the entire market. The headline of one article I’m quoting is: it’s not just AI.

So if you’re trying to be defensive, your only option seems to be to stock up on gold, oil, pitchforks, and shovels. Or buy a LOT of tinfoil to keep you and your family wrapped tight for…however long this lasts

> As the S&P 500 booked its best weekly advance since early January, one detail set this week apart: All 11 of the large-cap index’s sectors managed to finish in the green for the first time since November, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 managed to clinch its 13th record close of 2024

> “It’s like a rising tide lifts all boats. There is more participation in this advance. It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.”

> The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth. Three sectors hit new highs this past week—tech, healthcare, and industrials. Financials and materials are less than 5% away from their peaks. Costco Wholesale, which sells more corn chips than microchips, is at a record too.


**S&P 500 Sector	Gain during week ended Feb. 23**

* Consumer Staples	2.1%

* Information Technology	2%

* Materials	1.9%

> Most of the market’s 25% gain since late October was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates starting in March—or May at the very latest. Recent comments from members of the Fed, along with signs of persistent inflation, suggest that the first cut could come in June or even later. Hopes for as many as seven rate cuts this year have faded away. **At some point, rate cuts will matter again.**

While that’s still well below the high of 91% reached on Jan. 2, it’s a notable improvement from the lowest level of the year, which was just shy of 51% on Feb. 13

Also, once I do open the accounts, any recommendations on what to invest in to start with?  Like VOO or VTI?

1ay8rhw,investing,opinions on my investment strategy.,"Hi there! I’m looking for some opinions on my investment strategy.

Assume this scenario:  
\- Mid 30’s.  
\- Saving \~100k per year.  
\- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.  
\- Wanting to “retire” in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.

The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I’m not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I’m fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.

I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I’m thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.

I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.

My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV. If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.

Is there anything I’m missing or not considering?

1ay852f,investing,Do all stocks go up because one stock goes up?,"NVDA is a $2 trillion company, which is the third largest American company. As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,

Because this leads to an unintuitive conclusion in my head: given two stocks A and B that have zero alpha and high beta in unrelated sectors. News that affects the price of stock A causes an effect on the price stock B simply because of their beta values.",2024-02-23 18:40:11,2024-02-28 20:00:59.709054,5 days 01:20:48.709055,73,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay852f/do_all_stocks_go_up_because_one_stock_goes_up/

1ay6u5t,investing,401k reallocation at market peaks,"Hello.

My 401k is underperforming the general market because of my current allocation:

43% large cap growth index
43% large cap value index
13% small cap index

Generally I'm looking to be 100% in index funds and match the annual performance of a major index like S&P or NASDAQ. 

So the 56% of my portfolio in value and small cap is dragging my overall performance as compared to S&P and NASDAQ.

I'm going to reallocate but since S&P and NASDAQ are at all time highs, I don't think it's a good time to move large chunks of money in.

I've changed my future contributions to buy 100% large cap growth. I'm comfortable with a DCA approach on my contributions.

I'm considering just holding my current assets until there is a dip in the large cap growth or a big spike in the value.

What's your approach with reallocation at our current ATHs?

1ay2gua,investing,The weird psychology of selling a portion of your stock,"On one hand when I sell a few shares, I want to see the price go down afterwards so I know I sold at a good time.

On the other hand, I still have stock invested, so I certainly want to see the price go up, whether I sell a portion of it or not.

So maybe it's always a win/win situation.  Or maybe always lose/lose?   Can it somehow always be neutral -- the price doesn't matter *at all* when you sell a small number of shares?  So confusing.

I suppose it depends on the % you sell -- for a small sale %, you still *always* root for the price to go up and never worry about selling a few at the right time.  Just sell and move on.   Only for a large sale % does it make sense to ""root"" for the price to go down.

1ay01bj,investing,The Rise of Old West Carson City Coins: A Digital Era Investment Opportunity,"  
In the fast-paced world of digital transactions and virtual currencies, the allure of physical coins with historical significance is experiencing a resurgence. Among these coveted treasures are the Old West Carson City coins, particularly Morgan Dollars, Twenty Cent Pieces, and Trade Dollars. While these coins have long held value among numismatists and collectors, recent shifts in global currency dynamics are poised to exponentially increase their worth.  
  
As the world steadily progresses towards the widespread adoption of digital central bank currencies, the role of physical currency is undergoing a transformation. The elimination of physical currency is not merely a hypothetical scenario but an inevitable reality as governments and financial institutions embrace the efficiency and security offered by digital transactions.  
  
This seismic shift in currency dynamics will have profound implications for physical coins with historical significance, such as those minted in Carson City during the Old West era. As physical currency becomes increasingly scarce, the demand for tangible assets with intrinsic value has been  skyrocketing. Elite collectors and savvy investors alike are seeking out coins with rich historical narratives and tangible scarcity.  
  
Among the most sought-after Old West Carson City coins are Morgan Silver Dollars, with the highest demand for the CC-minted 1889 Morgan, CC-minted Twenty Cent Pieces, and CC-minted Trade Dollars. These coins, minted in limited quantities and imbued with the spirit of the Wild West era, hold a unique appeal for collectors and investors seeking tangible assets with enduring value.  
  
The distinctive ""CC"" mint mark, signifys their origin in the heart of the Old West.   
  
Twenty Cent Pieces minted in Carson City are prized for their rarity and historical significance. Minted for only a brief period from 1875 to 1878, these coins represent a fascinating chapter in American coinage history.  The Trade Dollars minted in Carson City are also poised to experience a surge in demand among elite collectors. These coins, originally minted for trade with China and other Asian markets, hold a unique place in American numismatic history. 

As the world adapts to digital central bank currencies attentive Investors are beginning to seek out tangible assets with historical significance, and it's driving demand and increasing their value to unprecedented heights. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity that many Investors will miss. While the opportunity is here and now for physical, tangible investments most Investors are looking in the wrong direction for new opportunities.

I have absolutely no knowledge of investing, so I would like to hear inputs from more qualified people.

For context: I work for a telecom company, and in the past they have not offered stock option for employees. now, suddenly the company announced that they would offer stock purchase for employees because apparently ""many people voiced their request, and we heard"".

Here's the thing: from what I observed, the stock option doesn't give employees any type of discount for the purchase. Also, instead of letting employees purchase directly, the company is offering it through their retirement funds.

I felt that there's something wrong and looked up the company's stock performance, and in the past 5 years, the company's stock values has doubled between 2020 and 2021, but from then on it dropped back down to half its values from peak.

1axrow5,investing,"Healthcare ETF for HSA, specifically VHT","I saw a pretty interesting strategy the other day and wanted to hear the communities’ thoughts on it.

If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu

However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.

It’s sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there’s universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you’ll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

1axqdrd,investing,Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.  
  
<video here>  
  
The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.  
  
I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.  
  
That's not what is going on here.  
  
First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.  
  
NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.  
  
With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.  
  
Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.  
  
Maybe Dan is just confused.  
  
Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.  
  
There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.  
  
Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.  
  
See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.  
  
Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".  
  
That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.  
  
Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.  
  
Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.  
  
Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?  
  
Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.  
  
It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.  
  
MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.  
  
Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.  
  
Data gets stored and then you access said data.  
  
LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.  
  
The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.  
  
The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.  
  
The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.  
  
There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.  
  
There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.",2024-02-23 03:23:52,2024-02-28 20:00:59.709210,5 days 16:37:07.709210,22,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/

Hi all,

My spouse and I have about $500k in a MMF currently generating interest at 5.43% and are looking to make a better use of the money until we buy a house in 2-3 years. One idea was to take a portion ($250k+) and short-term trade in VOO/VTI, buying and selling within a few days. Having watched how those two move for the past year, it seems like it could work if I sell even after a 0.1% increase, but I do realize there is always a risk with stocks.

As the title suggests, I am considering investing in Venture Funds. For context, I normally invest with Schwab, but I have a SoFi account and am considered a “SoFi Plus Member” (whatever that means) so I received a notification about IPO access and ended up getting distracted while checking it out and started looking into their Venture Fund offerings - which is why I’m writing this post.

I’m asking because, although they’re already risky, I noticed that they have insane gross/net expense ratios compared to ETFs, making them even more risky. 

Taking calculated, sensible risk that I can justify isn’t really something that typically bothers me, but this seems kind of like instead of mitigating my risk, I’m just hedging my risk with even more risk. On the bright side, the investment minimums are low, so that definitely counts as a positive! 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 
Some examples of the rates are below.

Fund 1 - $2500 minimum, 5.7%gross expense ratio / 2.9%net expense ratio

Fund 2: $2500 minimum, 6.74% gross expense ratio / 6.75% net expense ratio (so no discount here)

1axkxfn,investing,How to read ratios from Yahoo Finance,"I was frustrated trying to look these all up separately, so I'm making my own post as a reference. I took an investing course and these are generally the numbers that are good.

This is not an exhaustive list, but please reply in the comments with ratios I've missed, and what numbers we should be looking for so people can open this, and search the thread.

A good **Sharpe ratio** typically falls within the following ranges:  
  
Greater than 1.0: Considered acceptable to good by investors.  
Higher than 2.0: Rated as very good.  
3.0 or higher: Considered excellent.  
Under 1.0: Considered sub-optimal

**Beta** \- Measure of risk. A score of 1 matches the market. 1.5 means if the market moves 1, that stock moves 1.5. A score of 0.5 means if the market moves 1, it moves 0.5. Higher the number, the more volatility. 

A good **Treynor ratio** is typically higher than the market’s ratio, which serves as a benchmark. Historical data suggests that the market’s ratio is usually around 1.

**Price/earnings (P/E) ratio** \- Lower the better. Less than 2.5 is good.

**Price/sales (P/S) ratio** \- Lower the better. 1.0 - 2.0 is good. Less than 1, excellent.

**Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio** \- Below 1.0 is good value

**Price/book ratio** \- Range 1.0 - 3.0. Less than 1.0 is excellent.

**Enterprise Value/revenue ratio (EV/R)** \- Good is between 1.0 - 3.0. Lower is better.

**Enterprise value/ EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (EV/EBITDA)** \- Less than 10. Lower is better.

**Price/cash flow (P/CF)** \- 10 or less. Lower is better

**Price/free cash flow (P/FCF)** \- 15 or less. Lower is better.

**Dividend payout ratio** \- Less than 50% excellent. 50-70% good. The higher, the more cautious you should be.",2024-02-22 23:13:51,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834546,5 days 20:47:09.834546,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axkxfn/how_to_read_ratios_from_yahoo_finance/

1axei3n,investing,Nvidia-fueled tech rally puts Nasdaq Composite record in sight,"Hah. I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago!  

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era

From MarketWatch:

> An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**

> The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.

> If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Wow

> The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024.

> The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, 

There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days. 

Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. 

Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn’t go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.

For individual stocks positions, however, I find myself struggling to hold on to EXTREMELY large winners, when I do have them. I know the phrase goes, ""water your flowers and cut your weeds"", or something like that. But for example, I've been trimming my meta position, which is currently up almost 200%.

I'm not asking for personal advice on one stock in particular, rather, how to be more comfortable with letting winners run. But perhaps I already am, since I held for so long, and am only worried now with how hyped the market is? 

Another thing, is cutting losses. On a few stocks, I'm down 20-30%, and while I'm not uncomfortable with holding where I see a positive future, in some companies I don't.

Is there any benefit to doing that versus using my post-tax dollars to purchase stocks, ETFs, whatever, and letting them sit until I'm ready to retire?

1axawcd,investing,When is the best time to roll an IRA to Roth? ,"I had an old 401k from a previous job that was performing atrociously for years, and I decided to roll it to an IRA to get better investment options. Mission accomplished, and it's now growing comfortably, but I'm realizing that I might want to use the backdoor Roth strategy in the future, and would be hit by the pro-rata rule. 

When would be the best time to roll this thing to Roth? Are there any strategies that would make this easier? Some considerations:

- The current size of the account is $12k. I could afford the taxes on that, but it would eat up nearly the entire raise I just got.

- The markets are at all-time highs. I know it would be best to roll when the markets are down, but there's no way to time a crash. The longer I wait to roll, the higher my tax bill could potentially get. 

- I don't expect to lose my job anytime soon, but who does? 

Is it better to put off paying taxes as long as possible, but potentially pay higher total taxes in the long-term through pro-rata as the account grows? Or is it better to just get it out of the way now, before the account grows any larger?

I opened a betterment Roth IRA in 2019. It was an easy option for me as I didn’t have to learn too much about what to invest into. First couple of years I maxed out, last two I haven’t been able to because of a career change. Overall it’s doing well, averaging about 10% a year. 

But I’m starting to wonder if it’s best for the long term like when I retire. Has anyone retired with one of these accounts yet? Have you been completely fucked with fees or bad returns? And any recommendations on where to move the money too that is not a robo investor!

“Yet, the path to expansion is not without its hurdles. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions, including the green light from the Canadian Securities Exchange and a nod from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Such regulatory landscapes are complex and demand careful navigation. Draganfly's move is underpinned by a solid legal framework, leveraging an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside the company's Canadian short form base shelf prospectus. The anticipation builds as the final terms of the offering are to be disclosed in a final prospectus supplement, a document that will mark the culmination of meticulous planning and strategic foresight.”

1ax2fmy,investing,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don’t teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don’t outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don’t always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don’t think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don’t know what that is, just follow your intuition. It’s your best guide. Don’t choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets — like different industries and geographies — that will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that’s best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don’t want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don’t generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don’t make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don’t obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don’t revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path. One that this universe has crafted just for you.",2024-02-22 09:32:57,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834759,6 days 10:28:03.834759,29,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ax2fmy/wealth_advice_i_would_give_to_my_younger_self/
1awyoh4,investing,Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number,"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. 

> Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. 

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

1awwhhr,investing,Am I on the right track with investments? ,"Trying to figure out if I’m in a good place for my age (30 years old). I think I’d like to retire at 55-60 years old. I currently do not have any debt(no car payment, I always pay my cc each month, student loans paid for, and no mortgage). I do not own, I rent. It’s expensive where I am and at this point I don’t have a 20% down payment for a home - plus the homes where I live are just beyond outrageous. I think I’m fine renting for awhile. 

I am contributing 10% of my income to my 401K. Currently around 70K in there. I obviously didn’t always contribute that much but I’ve made more money over the years as I’ve moved up with my company.  They match 6%. I am considering bumping this up even more - probably 15 percent which is still a little below max contribution but my commission can vary so I want to be cautious. I also am almost making too much money for a Roth IRA. 

I am a part of an Employee stock purchase plan which offers stock at a discount and have been contributing 5% of my paycheck for the last almost 7 years. I also have received RSUs each year and am receiving even more per year with a promotion. So total value of this is 71K with a potential value of 18K that hasn’t vested yet - and more RSUs to come each year. 

A few years ago I started a health savings account. Currently only putting in what my company matches which is $750. So that’s 1500 a year. I’ve not invested any of this but am considering it. I have about 5K in there. 

After just staring at my dividends and unsure what to do with them (probably should have reinvested but whatever 🫠) I decided to use them to buy 6 shares of the ETF ITOT. I’m going to start off with 100 bucks a month into this but want to see how increasing my 401K contributions plays out financially first. The ETF world is a little new to me. Just starting out. A lot of my 401K is invested in vanguard so I figured it would be good to do an ETF that wasn’t vanguard for diversification reasons? This could be inaccurate thinking so open to feedback here. 

I’ve been saving since I got my job 7 years ago. I use to make much less so it’s been an up hill climb. But I have 26 grand in savings which I feel is a little disappointing. I have also just never really heard of a High Yield Savings account until recently so I just moved everything over and started saving in that account last year. I was putting around 250 a paycheck in there for around 6 years (having to dip in occasionally for unexpected vet or car bills for example). If my commission checks were a lot and I had left over pay I’d just send it over to the savings account. I now put around 600-1000 a month in the savings account depending on commission checks. I know it will grow faster because my contribution amount has increased recently but idk not feeling great about it. 

But anyways - is this a good place to be financially? Any advice at all? I’m always over fixating and worrying I’m not doing enough.

1awqkqx,investing,Matt Levine (Bloomberg) on the upcoming reddit IPO,"Matt Levine is alway funny and interesting and he hits on all the pluses and the many minuses regarding the reddit IPO and the supposed offer to some redditors. The thing about reddit is that it is just that, reddit. There isn't much of a moat, just ask the Digg guys how that went.


I guess there are three ways to look at this:

Reddit plans to place a big chunk of its IPO shares in the hands of its users, an unusual move that could build loyalty but also comes with risk. 

The company plans to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, according to people familiar with the matter. The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors. 

Ideally for the company and its underwriters, Reddit shares will rise in their stock-market debut, bestowing big gains on those who buy in at the IPO price. If the stock falls, however, it could anger those members of Reddit’s community — a group that, broadly speaking, hasn’t shied away from boycotts in the past.

Banks generally favor selling the bulk of an IPO to big money managers that tend to hold stocks for a relatively long time. Individual investors are viewed as more fickle and prone to selling at the first sign of weakness.

One is the sort of philosophical view. Reddit Inc., more so even than most social media companies, is a publisher that doesn’t pay its writers and editors. It runs a website that publishes huge amounts of content on various message boards; the boards are mostly moderated by volunteers and the content is written by users. From this, Reddit generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from ads and data. For the most part, the users do not really share in that revenue.

This model works fine — It is in fact the case that the users happily post and moderate on Reddit without getting paid! There is no need to pay them! — but it is awkward, particularly when an initial public offering is set to value the company at more than $5 billion. “We created $5 billion of value and get none of it,” some redditors will probably complain. Letting them buy stock at the IPO price doesn’t really address that complaint — they still have to pay for it! — but it sort of symbolically responds to it. “We let our users share in our success, by paying full price for the stock,” Reddit can say; it’s fine, whatever.[1]

The second is the conventional capital markets view. Here, the rough idea is that banks sell the stock in an IPO mostly to big institutional investors, most of whom they expect to buy and hold the stock. Then the next day, the stock opens for trading, and lots of people — institutions that didn’t get allocations, but also retail investors — want to buy it. But there’s not a lot for sale, because most of the IPO was placed with long-term holders. So there’s a lot of demand and not much supply, so the stock goes up, creating an “IPO pop.” This means that it is generally good to get an allocation in the IPO: You buy stock in the IPO, and the next day it reasonably predictably goes up and you make money. And retail investors mostly don’t get to buy a lot of stock in IPOs, so they miss out on this pop.

Letting individual redditors buy stock in the IPO sort of addresses this problem: The redditors get to buy stock at the institutional price, and then it goes up and they make money. On the other hand, if you let the retail investors buy in the IPO, that kind of ruins the mechanism that leads to the IPO pop? The devoted retail investors who want to buy the stock do so in the IPO, rather than having to wait until the next day, so there’s not as much demand when the stock opens for trading. And a lot of those retail investors might be looking to make a quick buck by flipping the stock, so there is more supply. So there’s less reason to expect a pop. “If everyone buys at the IPO price then there’ll be no one waiting to buy it the next day,” I wrote, when Robinhood Markerts Inc. tried this sort of thing, “and everyone who bought it to make a quick profit will be selling it at a loss.” (That did happen to Robinhood, though then it rallied hard the week after its IPO, so who knows.)

The third is the meme-stock corporate finance view. Most companies are mostly owned by big institutional investors, there are fairly traditional ways to keep those investors happy (steadily increasing earnings, clear communications, stock buybacks, etc.), keeping those investors happy keeps the stock price up, and a high stock price is good for the executives (who get paid largely in stock) and for the company (if it ever needs to raise money by selling more stock). But in the 2020s, some companies are owned in large part by retail investors, and some of those investors are more interested in being part of an online community of investors, and trading jokes and memes, than they are in financial analysis. And you can make those investors happy in less traditional ways, like by giving them popcorn or buying a gold mine or doing a YouTube interview with no pants on.

Lots of corporate executives want nothing to do with this, but some executives lean into it. And why not? Sometimes companies (1) need to raise money (because their business is in trouble) and (2) can’t do the traditional things that make investors happy (because their business is in trouble). Having some source of funding that is orthogonal to traditional business success seems like a good insurance policy: “If our business ever gets into trouble and we need money, we can always make some jokes with our retail investors and they’ll give us the money.” 

Not every company can get meme-stock investors. But you know who probably can? The whole idea of meme stocks originates with Reddit; Reddit’s boards are where the great meme stocks were created; Reddit is where the online communities of investors are. Surely Reddit has some advantages in appealing to retail investors on Reddit. It might as well get some of them in its stock early.",2024-02-21 23:12:25,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834852,6 days 20:48:35.834852,36,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awqkqx/matt_levine_bloomberg_on_the_upcoming_reddit_ipo/

1awpej3,investing,After the Bell: Nvidia clobbers earnings expectations as AI demand hits ‘tipping point’; stock up 6%,"I haven’t seen this posted yet. So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble.

I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble. 

From MarketWatch :

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-heads-for-biggest-drop-in-over-a-year-and-biggest-market-cap-loss-ever-6c617e9c?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns. And you can choose to ignore them if they are outside your risk and comfort level. That makes perfect sense.

1awjtwt,investing,"Confused about rolling over 401k, backdoor Roth and pro-rata rule","Hi all,

I've done some research and searched old posts but haven't found myself grasping the considerations around rolling over my old employer 401k.

Situation is as follows:

I have a Traditional 401(k) at T. Rowe Price from an old employer, balance is around $75k with $65k being contributions and $10k earnings.

The rest of my retirement accounts are at Vanguard, where I have two 401(k)'s from previous employers, a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The Traditional and Roth IRAs at Vanguard are used for backdoor Roth each year, as our income is over the limit for directly contributing to Roth IRA.

My goal is to simplify life by moving the 401(k) to Vanguard. As best I can tell, I'm paying $36/yr in fees to T. Rowe Price at the moment. I am currently not employed and so do not have an active employer 401(k) that could accept the rollover from T. Rowe Price 401(k).

I have read that high income earners should not rollover a 401(k) to a Traditional IRA because of the IRS pro-rata rule impacting backdoor Roth IRA, though I can't say I could explain why that is. However, I do know that I want to continue doing backdoor Roth IRA each year for the next 20 years or so.

I am considering rolling over the T. Rowe Price Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA and taking the income tax hit on the $75k now, in order to get 20+ years of tax-free growth in the years ahead. In this case, would I still run into issues with future backdoor Roth IRA contributions and the IRS pro-rata rule?

TLDR: If I convert a Traditional 401(k) from an old employer to a Roth IRA, will it compromise my ability to do future backdoor Roth IRA contributions?

Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated.

Edit: For the folks commenting that now is good time to do Roth conversion since I am not working, I should have mentioned that my spouse is a high earner and we expect our joint earnings to be at our current income level or higher in future years.",2024-02-21 18:45:45,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834977,7 days 01:15:15.834978,14,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awjtwt/confused_about_rolling_over_401k_backdoor_roth/

1awi9lb,investing,What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",2024-02-21 17:44:41,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834989,7 days 02:16:19.834989,1,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awi9lb/whats_the_role_and_future_of_intel_in_taiwans/
1awhjkz,investing,CNBC Market Coverage Overview,"The trading platform my work uses only has CNBC and no Bloomberg so I’m forced to watch it and here is what I have found. Thought I would share:

Squawk Box: Good show and often has the best guests. Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen are both solid interviewers but polar opposites. Andrew is a bit more liberal while Joe is a bit more conservative, they mix well together and Becky provides a good buffer between the two

Squawk on the Street/Money Movers: Good show but it is basically Cramers show. Carl doesn’t do much other than read a headline and let Jim rant. Faber is mostly a M&A guy and doesn’t provide much when acquisitions are slow (like now). Faber is a bachelor who when asked what his favorite part about being on CNBC said is that he gets to go to Saks and pick out suits and CNBC pays for it all. After the first hour, Sara Eisen replaces Jim. And stays on until Wapner and Halftime. Sara is very meh, not great but not awful. While Jim is very focused on individual stocks, Sara is more macro and provides some decent color. You’ll see a lot of good interviews during these times but it’s mostly just CEO’s talking up their companies or activists/short sellers just advertising their positions so be weary.


Jim Cramer: Ok Cramer gets his own section for obvious reasons. A lot of people give Cramer a hard time but I like the guy and think he truly means well and wants to help people. The thing is, is that when you spend years talking about stocks all day, you’re going to be wrong sometimes and he has been wrong and people seem to amplify them and forget about his winners. Nevertheless, the guy is clearly smart (Harvard, Goldman, Hedge Fund) and super well connected and gets great CEOs and guests on Squawk (and Mad Money) despite often asking really tough and direct questions. He is also funny and is able to provide you a good Birds Eye view of companies that are trending that you would otherwise not care about. People say he only talks about stocks he owns and that is true but on purpose as that is what his whole hedge fund strategy was built on before he went on TV. The guy would just talk up stocks he owned to analysts in the 90s and those analysts would talk about the stock, causing people to flock in and the price to rise. Overall, I think Cramer gets a bad rap given what he provides, that’s not to say he is perfect or to take anything he says to your brokerage account but he definitely does not deserve an entire inverse etf

Halftime Report: I usually turn off the sound here as this segment can get annoying. Wapner is alright and can often challenge the guests but it’s hard to tell if I like him as the guests are just abysmal. Most of the guests just like to hear themselves talk. Josh Brown thinks he is Warren Buffet and Scott will never challenge him. Joe T has an etf. If you didn’t know, dont worry, he will mention it multiple times. Stephanie Link just never stops talking. Some of the other guests are good but they can never get a word in because those three love to talk and Scott never interrupts them. Overall, the segment is very foggy as many of the guests are trying to sell themselves/the funds or companies they work for so it can be hard to take anything away from what they say without a large grain of salt that they have other motives for advertising their positions

Power Lunch: I really like this segment as both Kelly and Tyler are laidback and not too serious. No good guests but you often see a lot of interesting stories that aren’t as widely covered. Not much to this part but a good listen as the trading day winds down

Closing Bell: Another solid segment as Scott is good here and the guests are often solid. Nothing too exciting but a good end of the day wrap up.

I usually turn it off after closing bell so can’t provide much color after that but thought I would share my two sense on CNBC market coverage throughout the trading day",2024-02-21 17:16:35,2024-02-28 20:01:00.834996,7 days 02:44:25.834997,9,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awhjkz/cnbc_market_coverage_overview/

1aweeqt,investing,"If the best strategy to make money is to buy and hold an index fund, who is keeping the market “efficient”?","I always hear that actively managed funds (and individuals) fail to beat indexes such as the S&P 500. If this is the case, how does the market stay efficient when instead of needing to research companies based on their fundamentals, capital just flows into the top 500 companies with no regard to whether or not they are actually good companies?

It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:

1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.

2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies. 

Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes. 

If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of “you can’t beat the market” is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.

It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.  
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.  
Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.  
The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.  
Reddit's IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest's debut in 2019.

I've been helping my parents invest properly this past year, sadly they have only been using savings accounts and CDs to store/grow their wealth.

  
My parents are retired (no jobs) and currently live off my father's disability payments (army veteran) and both there's social security.

  
I recently discovered that money earned from disability can be contributed to his Roth IRA (just opened) so I plan to fund it with $7,000 for this year. As for my mother would we be able to contribute another $7,000 in my fathers IRA since they file taxes jointly. This would be $14,000 total contributed into my father IRA for this year, is this okay since they file taxes jointly?

1aw6pkf,investing,Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player,"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.

So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.

Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

Strategy:

So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.

(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)

Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.

I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.

Financials and Macro:

So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -

These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.

A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.

So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.

Now to their Balance Sheet: They have

around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.

Market Cap: 5.17 Billion

So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.

Risks:

The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H & M and less from Fashion Brands.

Of course many people would also think, that amazon will just also take the fashion e-commercemarket very easily, however i think, that people want a special place for buying their brand clothes and don't want to search bar for their product of choice. More and more of the sales will be impuls sales, with the customers scrolling through the app at a busstop and just buying something that they like, which is not possible with amazon, due to their big supply of many other things, than brand clothing.

Another risk is, that the macro enviroment right now is much worse and the DACH Market where around 45 % of their revenue lies, is growing a bit slower than the 8 % Cagr in Europe. Even though this is possible, their DACH-Market already is very profitable, with a 6 % operating margin despite the way lower gross margin, so the very likely higher growth rate in their rest of europe department could lead to higher Operating margins here, due to more growth and the operating leverage, that comes with it.

So i think most of the European e-commerce stocks are really undervalued and even though we won't see the growth rates from the covid e-commerce hype, these buisnesses will still grow at very decent rates and should further improve their profitability, which makes Zalando in my opinion a good investment.",2024-02-21 08:00:45,2024-02-28 20:01:00.835078,7 days 12:00:15.835078,3,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/
1aw560f,investing,How to save to retire early? Would you start saving to retire early even if you enjoy the work or would you keep grinding?,"Main question is how to properly save for early retirement? Also what would you do In my shoes?

Long story short I worked my ass off and have been quite lucky. I have an accountant and I'll talk with him more about this when I go do my taxes as well but I'm mid 20s and have a business with 5 employees.

I take a salary of 70k. I work a ton so the math on the hours isn't great but I'm frugal and for now enjoy the work. Anyway it's all under an LLC right now and after all the business expenses are taken care of I'm still having about 12-15k a month left over. Currently my business account has a bit too much cash just sitting there.The business is in construction and while I don't want to scale this much more I have thought about branching out, outright building houses. Coupled with this I could take my lifestyle up a notch or two. Like I said not flashy but I do think I'd enjoy traveling more and traveling rich(er).

Or I up my salary start investing tons of money and retire early. Like forties. I could probably hire someone to run day to day but the hours are crazy bouncing between jobs and would realistically need 2 people. So it'd cost me a lot more than the 70k I pay myself. Would need a good nestegg saved up. 

What would you do? Right now leaning towards a soft retirement in my late 30s early 40s. Would hire someone to share the load of management but would still work some. If i start saving to retire early any pitfalls I should be aware of? Currently just have a Roth I'm contributing the max to which is all mutual funds and an account with about 50k in single stocks (thanks Nvidia lol). Also have like 12k in crypto.

And before anyone says anything I pay my guys well above market rate and give good bonuses I just got really lucky with some long term contracts (who you know who you blow).

I realize how fortunate I am in to be in this situation and I'm just a bit out of my depth with it.

1avt0yx,investing,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&P500,"Man I’m kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven’t checked on it in a while.   It’s supposed to be “aggressive” at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that’s what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don’t understand why TDF’s are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren’t we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn’t maybe read the room and see we’re in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?

I’m going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.   

I know TDF’s are popular here but I just don’t understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don’t think I’m ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that’s a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF’s inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.

1avl95c,investing,Why did the market think the Fed would cut rates this year?,"I'm wondering if there's a logistical reason to why the market tried to call the Federal Reserve's bluff to rate cuts this year? 

&#x200B;

I'm unsure why the market would just go about and assume that rate cuts ""had to happen"" and price in 7 rate cuts, when the fact is this is an election year. The Federal Reserve claims to have no part in our political system, so I don't understand why they would want to give any perceptions or assumptions of anything going on until after the election in November is finished? 

&#x200B;

To me it seems pretty clear cut that unless something breaks significantly (large bank failures such as JP Morgan or Capital One or Wells Fargo, etc) - that there is no reason to lower interest rates until after the election. Inflation is still a big question. YoY CPI is around 3% but inflation is still 20-25% since 2020. The economy is ""booming"" if you take the jobs reports to be truthful. And in may ways if we find out the jobs numbers are lies, the market could react by having a huge surge which would cause more inflation. 

  
Europe and China are in recession, but that's no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the U.S. Like Bloomberg said all of last year - we have a case of American Exceptionalism here. 

&#x200B;

I think the stock market at best will be flat all year while people start to realize those rate cuts are not happening. Next year we may have a crash after the election is decided when they cut rates and it creates the ""perception"" that something is broken, even if nothing is ""broken,"" per-se.",2024-02-20 16:06:13,2024-02-28 20:01:00.835179,8 days 03:54:47.835179,110,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1avl95c/why_did_the_market_think_the_fed_would_cut_rates/

I'd have to pay fed and state income taxes on the yield, vs. FDLXX paying fed gains and fed income taxes, and gains are both a lower rate and less likely to happen, which is a bummer. 9.3% CA tax on income means BOA’s rate is more like 4.46%.  
•	Pros: But BOA PD is easier to access in BOA ecosystem, counts toward preferred rewards, and avoids FDLXX's .42% MER which makes its yield more like 4.5% - whatever minimal gains. Do MMFs even make gains? Plus HYSA’s historically bottom out around 1% and often reach the 2s, while MMFs were \~0 in 2015, 16, 20, 21. Obviously you can move the money, but this is set and forget value.  
  
Also saw treasuries and municipal bonds and TIPS recommended for my sitch. See a huge selection of ML MMFs that kind of have me overwhelmed. Open to any suggestions there/tips on comparing.

1avf7si,investing,Achieve 1 Million Dollars Net worth in 10 Years,"Though this may sound ambitious and partially unrealistic, I'd like to achieve a net worth of $1,000,000 in 10 years between my (1) Robinhood Account (2) WeBull Account (3) Roth IRA and (4) Work 401K.

1. I use the Robinhood account strictly for ETFs only. Currently contributing $2,000 a month..
2. I use the WeBull Account strictly for Individual Stocks only. Currently Contributing $500 a month. I purchase fractional shares for every $500 split between 14 different stocks. I do this to maintain an 80/20 ratio between ETFs and Stocks.
3. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA account and buy ETFs only. Any dividends received from the Robinhood and WeBull accounts will go to the Roth IRA to help achieve the annual contribution limit.
4. My company contributes a percentage of my earnings during their fiscal year. I calculated their annual contribution to average a minimum of $580 a month to my Pre-Tax 401(k). Their match is tied to my earnings during their fiscal year so I expect my company's monthly contribution to increase by a few dollars every year.

In total, I'm working with roughly $3,500 a month to investments. I paid off all debts and started the year with roughly 20k between all 4 accounts. I'd need to average at least 14.15% of growth over the next 10 years so that I break a million by January 2034. If this were possible, how could I achieve this? Should I adjust my ETF:Stock Ratio to 70/30 so that I can achieve a higher growth? I'm trying to mitigate my risk as much as I can but not too sure how to go about this and would like to hear everyone's thoughts.

Alternatively I could buy longer term bonds like 10Y, get a lower yield (4.2%), but expect to make capital gains and sell when the rates are cut. Risk is rates going up more because i’m stuck with lower bond prices and locked in for 10 years, but that would be suicidal for the economy.

Understand that no one here is giving me official advice I'm just gonna lay out my logic and would appreciate some guidance or other things to consider before potentially abandoning the idea completely or taking the next official step and setting up a consultation (either tradersaccounting or greeentrader, any others you suggest?).

Quick rundown, I have a normal day job w/access to health insurance and a 401k and also fund a roth IRA. I use IBKR and about 85% of my trading (about 3-4 round trips/month) is futures trades with the other 15% being options and etfs. 

So I DO NOT qualify anywhere near the 720 trades a year to make it to TTS status and if I understand that is the ONLY way I could look at writing off various legitimate trading expenses (home office, internet, etc.). 

I do beleive however if I do some sort of business for trading I may be able to get access to other retirement accounts (sep IRa?) that I may be able to shuttle more tax advantaged money tothus shortening my retirement timeline (not getting around minimum age but hope to be more ""ready"" by then). I don't know what other things could actually be considered a write off, you hear the joke about talking about ""business"" over lunch it has now become a tax write-off, not looking to do anything not legitimate but seems there are some advantages out there the average person can't do not owning a business. 

So far the main drawbacks I have seen from my research is potentially paying professional data fees (I use IBKR). 

So can someone help me think through if there is any benefit or is it a lost cause.. oh let's not forget the best ""pro"" of all to owning a business is getting that sweet restaurant depot membership!

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

Or if there's another platform that is better than all three, I'd be keen to hear about it.

1aup1n7,investing,Total Gains / Lost when continuously investing,"My question: How are gains / losses calculated when you constantly invest?

For context I have about $15000 between ETFs and a HYSA. 
~10,000 in HYSA
~2,000 in QQQ
~1500 in SCHD

Looking at my gains / losses I’m only up 2%.

Couple of questions I have are:

1. How is this calculated? I just recently (last few weeks) I bought all the SCHD I have, and 2 more shares of QQQ. How are the gains / losses calculated even though I’ve already had some QQQ? Does it take into account say I bought QQQ at $400 a year ago (hypothetical) and it went up 10% to today. I bought more today ($440) and it went down 5% in a year ($418). My total gain / loss would be +5%? Is that right? 

2. Is my percentage of gain / loss because a small % of my portfolio is actually invested? I only have about $3700 invested and 10,000 in a HYSA. So portfolio wise I’m not up a bunch but individual ETFs I’m up around 20%? (QQQ is around +14% & SCHD is +6%)

3. Last question is, the gains loss tab for the lifetime of my portfolio? From day 1 of investing into QQQ until today? ",2024-02-19 14:49:46,2024-02-28 20:01:02.585547,9 days 05:11:16.585547,16,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aup1n7/total_gains_lost_when_continuously_investing/
1aundu1,investing,Is 10-20% allocation really enough to make a difference long term? ,"Right now I’m 80/20 VTI and AVUV in my ROTH IRA. I’m planning to set it and forget it and don’t plan on touching this money for several decades. I see a lot of people on here take a similar approach - often devoting a large percentage (70-80%) to a core fund like VOO/VTI and then allocating 10-20% amounts to other funds. 

With that in mind, I can’t help but wonder if 10-20% is really enough to make a difference in the long term, or are we just splitting hairs due to our need for “control”. I get that it’s nice to play in different ponds for diversification sake, but if your 80% fund is in the tank, are you really going to be that happy that 10% of your portfolio isn’t?

1aul5f4,investing,Greed: Wealth's Ruthless Enemy,"I [33M] was there when FTX collapsed, sending the entire Crypto market plummeting. Prior to this event, I diligently followed numerous Twitter accounts in the Crypto space and was thoroughly following reputable Crypto YouTubers, intending to invest in crypto before the whole FTX incident unfolded. Little did I know that I was witnessing a significant dip and should have seized the opportunity to buy at that time.

Regrettably, I waited, hoping for an even greater drop so I could purchase during the ""real"" dip. Unfortunately, my hesitation was fueled by greed, leading to a missed opportunity. Reflecting on it now, I find it difficult to forgive myself for not capitalizing on the Crypto market during that downturn. I could have at least bought some and sold them today, at a profit.

Dealing with the daily realization that, as a first-time investor, I missed a massive chance is undeniably disheartening.

Moving forward, I'd like to ask what are some investments that could yield returns in the short-to-medium run. While I understand the stock market is often seen as a long-term investment, I'm not looking to invest with a huge amount at this time.

I assume it has something to do with bitcoin becoming a major medium of exchange (and since supply is capped price will have to rise as people buy in to use it for transactions, like silver in 18th century China). But even if you believe in the blockchain, what makes you confident that Bitcoin specifically will get widespread adoption, when it’s trivially easy to create new coins?

Obviously I’m deeply skeptical, but I’m asking in good faith, I do really want to understand what the theory is here.",2024-02-18 00:10:19,2024-02-28 20:01:02.585644,10 days 19:50:43.585644,1254,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1atgikx/people_who_hold_a_lot_of_bitcoin_what_is_your/
1ate4w0,investing,Advice on ways to grow NW beyond just investing taxable brokerage accounts? ,"I just posted my NW here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/s/Bv0P91fuL4 

What I am looking for is advice on any other ways to grow retirement non taxable accounts?? I have learned a lot from reddit and while I am seeking Financial advisors, I want to be informed independently too. 

For several reasons I am quite behind on my 401k value as it should be per my age (been contributing since 2010.)

Mistakes I think I made:

1. Started contributing late. Missed out on 3 years of contribution into 401k

2. Didnt max out 401k contribution until 2-3 yrs ago. Was contributing around 6% or so. Match was 1.5% for many years. 

3. Stopped contributing to Roth as I was above income limits starting 2017. Didnt take advantage of backdoor etc

4. Didnt reinvest dividends in non taxable accounts. (All reinvested now.)

5. Didnt take advantage of HSA.

6. Lost NW from Divorce. (No pre nup)

7. Didnt take advantage of additional contribution from my company for certain employees. ( a company benefit I missed out on).

What I am doing now:

1. Fully maxed out on 401k

2. Working through backdoor/megabackdoor to start the roth contributions each year.

3. Currently investing in Tbills (moved away from CDs) for tax reasons. (Laddered Tbills 6 months and a year). Doubt i”ll have this option in the future.

4. In 8 yrs when I am 50 and if the law still allows then I”ll take advantage of  the catch up contribution but its not much. 

No HSA available to me. 

My Question - What else can I do to grow my non taxable account value? 

Is all my NW going to come from taxable accounts? With high CA taxes, lawyer fees each year (hoping it will be resolved next by end of year) and forced to put house purchase on hold I dont know what else to do other than start really cutting on expenses to Grow my savings.

NW: ~ 1M; break down is as follows:

1. 290k in brokerage account

2. 200k Tbills

3. 100k HYSA which is my EF

4. 200k 401k, TiRA and Roth

5. 210k in RSUs vested

HHI: 600k depending on stock price.

(Car loan is already deducted from the liquid assets I have. No CC debt as its paid off every month. I Invest 1000 per month in stocks since last 2 yrs - had a gap of 3-4 months due to large expenses. Saving 5-10% each paycheck into HYsA.) 

Everything currently points to just building and growing my taxable assets - brokerage, HYSA and perhaps in the future rental / primary property. 

Is that really the case?",2024-02-17 22:24:12,2024-02-28 20:01:02.585648,10 days 21:36:50.585648,8,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ate4w0/advice_on_ways_to_grow_nw_beyond_just_investing/

1at0rcx,investing,My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!,"**UPDATE:  The money was finally moved to her IRA after complaining up the chain of command.  But read forward to understand how crazy 401K to IRA Rollovers can be.**

My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check.

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**  Yesterday, in total frustration, she talked to a supervisor and was told the same thing- the rollover is in process.

This could happen to any of us with any Investing/Brokerage Company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.

* **Finding out if the startup/business is real (due diligence)**: Like I don't know if their revenue is accurate or how many active users/customers they have
* **Tracking their investments**: If you've invested $25k in each startup, how can you track them? Bth the financial amount and the startup's progress
* **Exiting sooner than a liquidity event**: Is it possible to transfer your shares you got as an angel investor sooner than a liquidity event (e.g. another funding round) by the startup? Like sell your shares to another investor or exchange them for another startup lol
* **People just assume you're rich by default**: Noticed in some events when someone says I'm an angel investor, founders rush into them asking for >$100k. Is that normal?

1asbqw2,investing,Buy high or find something else?,"Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

TL:DR
I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

It looks like the recessions we are having today will be more and more sectorial/industrial than global.  
What i mean by that is that if a sector or industry is having a layoffs, drop in sales or a recession than it would impact mostly that industry while other industries will keep on their same trajectory.

1. Regulatory Dichotomy: The U.S. presents a regulatory mosaic, with state and federal laws creating a complex tapestry of driving regulations. Conversely, China operates under a unified federal system, spearheaded by Xi Jinping, an unchallenged architect of policy.  
2. Autonomous Ambitions: This contrast in governance models suggests a divergent path toward the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The U.S., with its regulatory labyrinth, might find itself trailing, whereas China's streamlined approach positions it at the forefront, potentially accelerating Chinese dominance in the autonomous vehicle sector through invaluable real-world data accumulation.  
3. Economic Transitions: Yet, the broader economic canvas reveals China amidst a seismic shift from a manufacturing behemoth to a service-oriented giant.

I'm sure you've seen the latest update on the Fear and Greed Index indicating extreme greed.

There are some warning signs that the economy is slowing down, such as:

- The real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which measures the change in the unemployment rate, is at 0.2%, which is close to the threshold of 0.5% that signals the start of a recession
- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index, which tracks 10 indicators of future economic activity, declined by 0.1% in December 2023, the first drop since April 2020.
- The OECD Composite Leading Indicator, which covers 37 countries and regions, fell by 0.1 point to 99.6 in November 2023, the lowest level since June 2020.

1arpw2b,investing,CZR - Caesars Entertainment 'Research',"Was in Las Vegas February 7-13, 2024. Stayed at the Horseshoe (CZR strip property). I have a traditional ""lads' trip to Vegas Super Bowl weekend every year (this was my 6th trip) - extended a bit more this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs ""mid-market' properties

Noticed that the high-end properties (Cosmo, Aria) were hopping and jammed. (note: not CZRs properties). 6-8 craps tables operating Thursday and Friday night, with $50-$100 minimums. By contrast, the CZR properties across the street (Planet Hollywood (PH), Paris, Horseshoe, Linq, Flamingo) were much quieter. For instance, PH only had 3 $15 craps tables on Thursday night.

Tables seemed no busier than previous years at the mid-market CZRs properties. Hypothesis is that the ""gambling / partying"" crowd was priced out this year with the Super Bowl in town.

CZRs Execution Risk

PH's marquee 'Heart Bar' was being renovated and converted to a chandelier / glass bar. The new bar was not ready Wednesday-Thursday-Friday during the day of Super Bowl week. (It eventually opened Friday at midnight). Not a good look to have a marquee drinking/party hangout not ready to go for one of the busiest times of the year.

Craps dealers at Paris (Friday night) and Horseshoe (Sunday night) were a long way from being centre-strip Vegas quality. Odds are ""meh"" and limits are high - there is really no reason to make a gambling trip to Vegas - your local casino likely has better dealers, lower limits, and better odds.

CZRs restaurants

Restaurants (Nobu at Paris, Bugsy/Meyers at Flamingo) were busy and an excellent value. So were the cocktails at Vanderpump (Paris).

Conclusion

Overall, the crew this year was a bit frustrated with the CZRs experience and may look elsewhere for our next strip.

1aro8ij,investing,"No load, no fee money-market Mutual Funds with minimums > $1 but less than $1M?","I currently put some cash in the mutual fund SNOXX, short-term, because it gets over 5% interest. It has a $1 minimum investment which is super convenient for using for ""loose ends"" in a brokerage account. It yields a heck of a lot more than most cash sweeps, and is only slightly less flexible because I can get the money out of it by the end of the day and then trade with it a couple days later at the latest. Unlike savings accounts there is no transaction limit per month so it's perfect for temporary money storage, and rebalancing purposes in a portfolio.

I notice that there are also funds that are similar, but have minimum balances of $1M, which, understandably, yield a bit more (often as much as 0.25% more), probably because of lower expense ratios because they have fewer little transactions. I have nowhere near this level of cash.

However, I would love to find something intermediate between it and these higher-yield, higher-minimum-balance ones. I don't particularly need the full flexibility of the $1 minimum balance nor do I really need to be able to trade in $1 increments.

Like if I'm buying / selling in increments of $100, $1,000, or $10,000, but am nowhere near the $1M mark, is there any way to squeeze another 0.05% or 0.1% or so return, out of some similar mutual fund that has the same basic flexibility?

1arndnn,investing,Parents Getting Screwed by their advisor - Try Facet?,"Edit: Not worth it. I'll just encourage them to ask questions and at least try to understand how much they pay him/earn a year.

Parents have a portfolio worth around 4.5M. Dad is early 70s earning \~250K/year and will work another 1-8 years (he would like to work as long as he can, but taking into account uncertainty). Mom late 60s, doesn’t work. Total expenses around 100-120K/year, no one is sick yet. Risk averse people.They pay advisor .75% fee, with 20% in money market, 75% bonds, 5% VTSAX bringing their total expense ratio to around 1%. Comes to around 40K/year in fees (they hold some money in their own checking account). However, when my mom asked him how much they were paying, he brushed it off and said something vague about a monthly cost without giving specifics. He also allowed them to sell in 2020, never get back into the market, and their total net worth has been the same for 4 years (so losing because of inflation). Parents not financially literate at all. I figured if they have almost all their money in cash/fixed income, but still insist on having an advisor, Facet (all fiduciaries) can do that for a quoted 5-6K/year, plus expense ratio around .1%. 6-8K/year tops, and they can keep everything in fixed income.  That would save them about $30K/year in cost. Facet claims to have a HYSA at 5.3% right now, and they can keep a primarily-fixed income plan but save a ton of money.Thoughts on this plan/Facet?

Why I don't trust him as their advisor:

\- When asked how much they pay a year, he said they are ""billed monthly"" and didn't give an actual number

\- Did not make clear to parents that they had to expense ratios into account - they genuinely thought they were just paying .75%.

\- He's an MBA and Registered Agent, but NOT a CFP

1arkuv9,investing,Blackrock Vs Vanguard investment funds. Who owns the underlying companies. ,"I just learned this myself, a bit embarrassingly late, that vanguard is owned by it's investors. So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible. 

Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?

Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund, while the shareholders in BlackRock profit from the money BlackRock earns through charging me fees. Or is it the shareholders who own BlackRock and then BlackRock invests in companies with the money provided by investors?",2024-02-15 17:27:20,2024-02-28 20:01:02.585864,13 days 02:33:42.585865,33,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arkuv9/blackrock_vs_vanguard_investment_funds_who_owns/

So CSPX is an SP500 ETF that is domiciled in Ireland and is good for foreign investors as it is accumulating and doesn't put us at risk of getting hit with a US estate tax if and when we croak. 

If you look at the chart I posted, I dunno why this ETF has these huge price ranges on certain days, which correspond to large trading volumes as well.

1argxca,investing,Interest rate for loaning money to flip houses.,"I have a guy that flips houses and sells them for a profit. He does multiple houses at a time. He buys the houses with cash offers  and flips them and then sells them for a profit. He gets the money for this from private lenders like myself and not banks. I’ve been doing this with him for 7 years or so. Everything has gone well. My question is he gives me 10% per annual interest for borrowing the money. So if I loan him $300,000 you multiply that by .10 and divide that by 12 (months) therefor he gives me $2,500.00 a month. He usually gives the capital back anywhere from 3-6 months. All of his work is insured and contracts are done to protect me and all that good stuff.

My question is does anybody else do this? Is 10% a good rate for me or could I get more? I had a different guy that wanted to do something similar and he heard I got 10% and so he said he would give me 11% just to get me to switch. The big difference is he wants me to sign a 5 year contract with my money. He also mentioned how it usually works is the longer the loan the lower the interest rate. Which got me thinking that I should be getting more than 10% with the original guy maybe.

  
Edit: A lot of comments about how I am not protected. The contracts I sign protect me. At all times I have ownership of the house. The county appraisal district has my name and only my name under ownership. If he misses a payment or goes bankrupt I have the house to sell to make my money back. Everything is fully insured. Not only the house but the remodel itself.

1ard9q5,investing,My first ~5 years as an investor,"Hello everyone,

A few years ago, I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/cnjhgt/23yo_started_working_full_time_looking_to_start/) about the beginning of my investing journey and [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/k02lkl/my_first_year_as_an_investor/) after my first year as an investor. Currently, I am 27 years old and have been investing for about five years. This is an update on my current situation: I worked as an IT/Business consultant for my first employer for three years, and now I am a data analyst consultant at a new job. My current salary looks like this:

* \~€2650 net
* \~€160 meal vouchers
* Company car & fuel card
* Pension savings ('Group insurance') to which \~€130 is added each month
* The 'usual' (insurance, holiday pay, 13th month, ...)



Since the last posts, my investment portfolio changed quite a lot. The total amount at the time of writing is hovering around **€149.000**:

* ETFs: Invested €33.000, now it is worth €44.000+
* Cryptocurrencies: Invested €5000, now it is worth €45.000
* Cash: €10.000
* Retirement funds: €4.000+
* Personal Companies: \~€35.000
   * Used €30.000 to start a small **real estate company** with 2 friends. We've done 2 projects since (flipping 2 apartments) but I'm still waiting on the final year overview from the accountant to update the €30.000 to the actual value right now.
   * The other €5.000 was invested in a business I recently took over together with my girlfriend. This business is a **fry shop** (called 'frituur' in Dutch) which is now running for a little over a month. Of course, we took a loan from the bank as well. It is still too early to update the value of this company.
* Real Estate: \~€30.000 in equity. This is the building that we bought together with the 'frituur' business mentioned above. We are in the process of renovating the apartment on the first floor so we can actually live there as well in a couple of months.
* A personal loan from my parents - €20.000. I took this out the finance the real estate that we bought. In this way, I didn't have to sell any investments.

1arbdre,investing,How I analyze stocks for the long-term: Framework walkthrough,"I wrote a post a few days back on why we should *learn* to analyze individual stocks, even if you choose to invest most of your money in index funds/ETFs. You can read the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1amihwf/why_you_should_learn_to_invest_in_individual/).

In this post, I will share the process I have been using to analyze individual stocks. It requires fair bit of work and thinking, but it’s worth the effort for the clarity I get.

When we buy a stock, we are buying piece of a business. By asking a series of structured questions, I try to understand how the underlying business works, predict what it will be like in a few years, and estimate a reasonable price for buying it whole.

I don’t want to spent weeks and months doing complex analysis and financial modeling like institutional investors. My goal is to do simple evaluation of publicly traded companies by putting in reasonable effort to arrive at a conclusion that makes sense for me as an the individual investor.

Even though I only intend to buy few stocks, I think that I will be buying the whole business and keep it for many years. And to figure out if I want to purchase it, I try to answer these six questions:

1. **What does the business do?**
2. **Is it a good business?**
3. **If it’s a good business, why is it good?**
4. **Can it remain a good business in future too?**
5. **Is it run by competent and honest people?**
6. **Is it available at a fair price?**

Let’s take a hypothetical example to illustrate how this investing framework can be applied. Imagine that a popular sandwich store in our neighborhood just became available for sale. We have money in bank and are seriously considering buying it. I will try to answer these questions in order (We will skip management analysis in this example as it’s more applicable for public companies)

**1. What does this business do?** We want to figure out how does this business work and make money. There are four main things to understand:

* What does the business sell? *(sandwiches, drinks, cookies)*
* Who are the customers? *(locals vs tourists, old vs young, rich vs poor)*
* How does it sell its products and services? *(what are the channels: in-store vs online orders vs group catering)*
* What are its costs? *(ingredients, labor, rent, marketing)*

**2. Is it a good business?** Once we have a decent understanding of how the business works, we want to look at its health. More specifically,

* Does it have a clean balance sheet? *(is it loaded up with debt? And how much assets the store owns?)*
* What are the sales of the store? *(revenue from sale of food and drinks)*
* What are the profit margins like? *(gross profit and net profit)*
* How much cash does the store generates? *(operating cash and free cash flow)*
* What’s the return on invested capital? *(Am I better off just buying risk-free bonds?)*
* How have these numbers grown or declined in last few years? How does these numbers compare to industry average and other similar food joints?

**3. What makes it a good business?** So far if we think it’s a good business, we now want to understand why is it so and how it stands out from competition.

* Who are its competitors? *(local joints, larger chains, other eateries)*
* Does it have a competitive advantage or a “moat” *(hard to have moats in food industry for local stores, but few have a strong brand)*
* Why do customers keep coming back to this place? Or will they keep paying even when we raise prices?

**4. Will it continue to be a good business in future?** This is where we need to think strategically about future, especially about three aspects:

* Is the company’s moat durable? *(If the owner or chef leaves, will the business tank? What can harm the brand?)*
* What are the main risks the business face? *(What if key suppliers go out of business or increase prices? Can changing customer preferences towards healthier foods impact sales?)*
* What are the biggest opportunities? *(is there potential for expanding store locations, increasing menu items, hiking prices, or cutting costs)*

**5. Is the business available at a fair price?** Now we bring it all together and assess if the current offer price is reasonable or too high. This needs a bit of number crunching, but we will avoid complex projections on heavy excel sheets.

* What drives earning growth? *(economy in general, influx of residents, inflation?)*
* How would the earnings grow in next few years? *(Future is uncertain and probabilistic so we need to think of worst, likely, and best case scenarios)*
* What would be the value of this business after a few years? *(what kind of multiple it is available today on earnings or sales? what will be a reasonable multiple in future?)*
* Will I loose a lot of money if things go wrong? *(Is there some margin of safety in price I am paying)*
* Given all this, what’s a price that I am happy to pay today? *(One that will meet my return expectations at risk I am comfortable with)*
* If the asking price is higher or lower than my happy price, why is that the case? *(Do I understand why owner is asking for lower price or why market is valuing it lower? What am I missing?)*

After I have good enough answers to these questions, I will put pen to paper and summarize my thinking in a crisp 1-pager. This will becomes my investing thesis and guide me to make a buy or pass decision. This is exactly the same process we can follow for analyzing any publicly listed company.

For every dozen or so 1-pagers I have write, I will *maybe* invest in one. Sometimes I won’t understand the business well enough and other times I won’t like the price. But that's okay! I know that I have done the hard part already. I will keep the stock in my watchlist, move on to the next stock, and update the analysis from time to time if I liked the business.

As you can imagine, this is simple but not easy. It’s not for everyone. But it is very satisfying and intellectually stimulating. And like every other skill, it gets easier with practice.

That's it! That's the process I use. I would love to hear you feedback on how I can improve on this. Also, if this is interesting, I can write few posts on diving deeper into each of these sub-parts with an example of a public stock.",2024-02-15 09:06:55,2024-02-28 20:01:03.877202,13 days 10:54:08.877202,8,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1arbdre/how_i_analyze_stocks_for_the_longterm_framework/

From MarketWatch:

> Wall Street fund managers are now extremely bullish, the closely watched BofA Fund Manager survey revealed. Fund managers have slashed their holdings in cash and Treasury bills to low levels: At an average of 4.2% of assets, cash levels are now down about a third since October, **and are a whisper from the 4% level that BofA, historically, considers an automatic sell warning**[my Reddit emphasis added]. Meanwhile, fund managers are now more heavily invested in U.S. stocks than at any time since November 2021

That is the paragraph that got my attention. First, I don’t think I’d ever seen that stat before. % cash if surveyed fund mgrs 

I can’t say it’s alarming. (And I took out a few adjectives and adverbs that made the article more sensational.) it depends on how smart you think fund mgrs are.

The author says than when the fund managers are soft on an industry, there are often good buys, because they are value priced based on the fund managers avoiding them. Of course, they *could* be avoiding sectors for good reasons. 

It’s questionable whether the fund managers are knowledgeable or not. But what is without question is wherever they go, they’re going to raise asset prices. Because they’re in command of so much money. It’s like the ETF principle. Or being added to the S&P 500.

So this is also what the report showed:

> Right now, fund managers are heavily invested in U.S. stocks and in bonds. Their most popular sectors are technology, communication services, and pharmaceuticals. Outside of the U.S., they are also big on Japanese equities

> Their least favorite sectors are energy, materials, banks and utilities. Their least favorite regions are Europe (especially London, but actually the whole continent) and emerging markets.

Where there are avoiding seems pretty reasonable and rational. Banks are completely in the air, while the fed tries to make up its mind. 

I’m surprised they are in Bonds at this time, but it doesn’t really say how much or what kind. Pharma is also surprising. I’ve been looking at AstraZeneca for a long ass time now and every time I take a half step toward buying some, it tanks. Which reminds me that I don’t understand the industry very well.

So a lot of money that was on the sidelines, as of last October, is in the market and it’s focused on tech, communications, pharma. And you can see the first two definitely being pushed, as if it needed any help. But I don’t see a whole lot of movement in Pharma unless I’m looking in the wrong places.

But what do you think it says about fund managers being optimistic and invested with both feet?",2024-02-14 21:33:41,2024-02-28 20:01:03.877233,13 days 22:27:22.877234,10,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aqyg44/want_to_chase_the_stockmarket_rally_read_this/

1aqlm34,investing,Exploring a Potential SPA Center/Hotel Project in Partnership with Local Government,"Hi everyone,  
  
I'm reaching out to this community because of a unique opportunity that has caught my attention. A local government here in Estonia is looking for partners to develop a SPA center/hotel, and this announcement really speaks to me both professionally and personally.  
  
**A Bit About Me:**  
My current business involves supplying promotional goods and items like hotel slippers to various clients, including those in the hospitality industry. This has given me a unique insight into this sector, albeit from a different angle. On top of that, I am a huge SPA fan myself. I've always been drawn to the relaxation, wellness, and the sheer joy that SPA experiences offer.  
  
**The Opportunity:**  
When I learned about the local government's initiative, it immediately sparked my interest. The idea of being part of creating a new SPA center/hotel — a place where people can find peace, wellness, and relaxation — is incredibly appealing. I see it as a chance to blend my professional background with my personal passion for SPAs.

* **What I'm Hoping to Find Out:**  **Interest and Viability**: Does the idea of developing a SPA center/hotel resonate with you? Do you think there's a market for another one, considering the unique angle we could bring? Advice on Getting Started: For those who have experience in launching or running a SPA or hotel, what were your initial steps? I'm looking for guidance on how to begin this journey.  
* **Building a Team:** Regarding team assembly, I have already started to consider involving locals who have a proven track record of successfully establishing SPA hotels. The idea is to tap into the wealth of experience right here in our community, leveraging their insights and expertise to ensure the success of this new venture. 
* **Funding and Investment:** One of the most crucial aspects – I don't currently have the funding to bring this project to life on my own. How do you approach finding and securing funding for such an endeavor? Are there investors out there who might be interested in a wellness-focused project like this? I'm keen to explore all avenues for outside investment, whether it's through traditional financing, venture capital, or crowdfunding. 
* **Your Thoughts and Suggestions:** I'm open to any insights, suggestions, or advice you might have. Whether it's about potential challenges, funding strategies, or tips for success, I'm all ears.

1aqcmj1,investing,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this.

They’re both big hitters in the industrial sector, but I have concerns over both. DE is set to further develop autonomous tractors, but I have a feeling their market share is already maxed out. I’m not sure how they increase their customer base to therefore increase revenue. As for LMT, their margins are already is small as possible given their position as gov’t contractors, and it seems like there’s more and more competition for these contracts. I don’t see how LMTs top or bottom line can get any better. Any thoughts? I’d prefer reasoning rather than just naming one stock or the other.

    Lyft also said it sees first-quarter bookings of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, beating StreetAccount estimates of $3.46 billion.

    The stock lost much of its gains after the CFO said the earnings release had a major error. 

     Lyft Chief Financial Officer Erin Brewer said on the earnings call that the company had misstated its margin expansion in the press release. Rather than 500 basis points, or 5%, of growth for 2024, as the company initially indicated, the actual increase will be 50 basis points, or 0.5%, Brewer said.

1apzguj,investing,Pagaya (PGY) is a hidden gem with a lot of potential.,"I own Pagaya $PGY and plan to keep buying up to $1.30 to $1.40. I believe there is tremendous upside left in the stock.  


**These are my reasons to buy:**  


**Pick and Shovel Play** : Pagaya is a Fintech, pick and shovels, AI play providing a platform/software service to commercial lenders like Visa, banks, and even Fintech competitor SoFi Technologies (SOFI). It has an excellent de-risking AI business model at scale for lenders and investors.  


**Low Credit Risk:** Pagaya doesn’t keep any loans on its books, except a small percentage of securitizations made by them for mandatory risk retention compliance.  


**Recurring Fee Based Business**: It charges fees to business clients (lenders) like Visa (V), Ally Financial (ALLY) and SoFi Technologies to provide due diligence and credit analysis of their potential borrowers - sift through their initially-declined loan applications, and find any good loans among the declined ones.  


**Network Model**: Pagaya bundles these loans and moves them to their final destination - investors. 80% of the loans get bundled into ABS, (Asset Backed Securities), which institutional clients have agreed to purchase in advance. The other 20% of the bundled loans are sold to private investors, and Pagaya charges them a fee for that service  


**Switching Costs:** It takes Pagaya and the lender about 2-3 years to complete onboarding and integration. Clients are likely to remain loyal.  
**It has strong capital and institutional Backing:** The Singapore Government Fund, which owns 9% of Pagaya is also a large buyer of ABS.  
**Strong pipeline:** Pagaya has a large and very credible pipeline, a unique business model, which de-risks the lending business in real time and a platform that works across several products and lenders.  


**Challenges, weaknesses and threats**  


**Cyclical:** This is a Cutthroat, Commodity, Cyclical business and sure there is the AI product differentiator, but over time, even M/L or AI platforms or software will become a commoditized business, without significant competitive advantages.  
Network volume flatlined in Q1-2022, at 1.6Bn, then stagnated at $1.9Bn in two quarters of 2022, with even one decrease to $1.8Bn. We finally saw growth renewing in Q1-2023 to $1.9Bn.  


**Barriers to entry are low: F**or example, their lender customers could easily develop the same software. Their lenders who are much bigger, SoFi Technologies itself is $7.5Bn in market cap, a little less than 10 times Pagaya's size, -- could become their biggest competitors by investing in similar AI software for themselves, eliminate Pagaya and shop their own product around like AWS.  


**Dilution:** Another challenge is the possibility of continued dilution. Share count stood at 738Mn shares in Sep 2023 compared to 667Mn in Sep 2022, an increase of 11%...  


**Valuation**  


Pagaya is priced at only 1.05 times sales and with an estimated Sales CAGR of 22%, this drops to 0.6x sales - it had current assets of $419Mn in Sep 2023- that’s about half its market cap of $855Mn ! That's a steal! Compare that to SoFi, which is priced at 3.7X sales and has a 3 year forward CAGR of 19% lower than Pagaya. Plus, SoFi earns only a part of its revenues from services, they earn interest income as well, which carries credit risk.  
They will soon be listed in the US - that itself could be a huge boost.  
And can also benefit from a reverse stock split, which removes the cheaper branding of a $1 stock.  


Sure there are risks, but I believe most of them are already priced in at a low price of $1.13, and the upside could easily be $4 to $5 in a few years.

1apvrs0,investing,Why Not 100% Equities - AQR,"New post from Cliff Asness (link at the bottom). Read the whole thing, but here are a few shortened takeaways.

* I don’t know anyone who thinks a portfolio of stocks and bonds has a higher unconditional expected return than 100% stocks. We prefer a diversified portfolio because we believe it has a higher return for the risk taken, not a higher expected return.

* In general we should separate the choice of 1) what is the best return-for-risk portfolio?, and 2) what risk we should take? This new paper, and many like it, confuse the two. If the best return-for-risk portfolio doesn’t have enough expected return for you, then you lever it (within reason). If it has too much risk for you, you de-lever it with cash.

* Rising valuations (since the 1990s) have made equities themselves (and especially the USA vs. ex-USA differential) a very likely overestimation of the future.

* Simply looking at historical results and urging investors to “buy the thing that’s gone up the most over the long term” is not financial analysis, it is finger painting.

tl;dr For the love of god, stop just saying ""buy VT and chill""

1apur6l,investing,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?","Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.   


And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",2024-02-13 14:28:31,2024-02-28 20:01:03.877444,15 days 05:32:32.877445,21,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1apur6l/looking_at_historical_data_does_it_show_that_this/
1apuexq,investing,Seeking Advice and Experience on Rollman Capital and Rollman Mining,"**Hey everyone,**  
  
I've been exploring potential investment opportunities with Rollman Capital and Rollman Mining. Both organizations caught my interest with their focus on investment management and Bitcoin mining services, respectively. Rollman Capital promotes a conviction-driven investment approach, aiming to blend performance with a positive societal impact. Meanwhile, Rollman Mining is all about providing access to Bitcoin mining through procurement of miners, software, pools, and hosting services, emphasizing professional-level equipment for both private and professional clients.  
  
My curiosity led me to a video call with the CEO of Rollman Mining, where we discussed various aspects of their services, including costs, potential ROI, and the specifics of their Bitcoin mining operations. While the conversation was enlightening, offering deep insights into their business model and promises of transparency and high returns, I'm left wanting to cross-reference these claims with independent experiences.  
  
Given the scarcity of independent reviews and a lack of publicly available financial data or significant third-party media coverage, I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for any personal experiences or insights you might have about Rollman Capital or Rollman Mining. I'm particularly interested in:

**-Your method of due diligence when assessing firms with limited third-party validation.**

1apuab5,investing,Qualified dividends for US funds,"Hi all,

I would like to invest in certain funds/ETFs that pay dividends, most of them to be qualified dividends. Before doing that, I would like to see the history of the distributions from that fund.

In Vanguard, for example, I can see the year-end QDI figures (payments in December) but not the payments made in other quarters.

One example of this is payments on 09/28/2023, 06/29/2023, and 03/24/2023 from VFIAX 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares. I cannot see any option to see the qualified dividend ratio for these dividend payments.

My question is how do I buy said shares? I've bought the warrants on Fidelity, is there something the company has to do with the warrants to allow share holders to buy or sell them? Because as of right now I can buy more warrants or sell them at the current warrant price.

And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. 

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.

1apj9ac,investing,BND vs BSV for Fixed Income,"Doing a bit more research into bond ETFs, and trying to understand the risks associated with [BND which is mostly 5 - 10 year bonds](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bnd#portfolio-composition) and [BSV which is 3 or less year bonds](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bsv#portfolio-composition) on average.

At this time their yields seem to be extremely similar with BND sitting at 4.36% SEC Yield and BSV having 4.46% SEC Yield. 

The only risk I can think of is if the FED starts dropping interest rates, causing BND's longer-term bonds locked in at a higher yield being able to hold on the better yields for longer, whereas BSV is going to be more dependent on recent prices?

That being said, I'm actually not sure how BND and BSV (bond ETFs) are managed when it comes to the market selling off bonds and re-allocating to different bonds. Do they frequently re-balance using secondary market?

1apgizp,investing,Calculating 2023 State Tax-Exempt Treasury Interest from SGOV,"Last year $SGOV was mentioned a lot in several subs as a way to get a 5% yield without paying state/local tax. This post, is more like a question/guide as I just got my 1099 from Schwab (the broker that i use only to buy SGOV and SWVXX). However, the 1099 DIV did not break down how much $ was exempt from state tax. I'm following [this](https://thefinancebuff.com/state-tax-exempt-treasury-fund-etf.html) guide and hopefully can be useful for other people who bought $SGOV or any other tax exempt ETFs in 2023.

Here is the screenshot of my [1099 DIV](https://ibb.co/5k5fcXF) as you can see its only 1 got box filled, but if i scroll down to the dividend section, you see [2 entries](https://ibb.co/1RzJd1d) with the amount of dividends i received in 2023. So, following the guide that i hyperlinked earlier, i look at % of SGOV which is [96.45%](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/2023-ishares-us-government-source-income-information-stamped.pdf).

Therefore, to calculate how much i put in my taxes on freetaxusa, i would put $230 in box 1, select ""Yes"" on ""Is this a mutual fund that has U.S. Government interest income?"" and on the next page I will put $**219.82884** on the box that says ""Enter the amount of your $230 of ordinary dividends that are from U.S. Government interest:""

The formula I got $219.82884 comes from $227.92 (total dividends i received in 2023 from $SGOV) \* 96.45% (U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\*/% from Treasuries).

Brine water is a big source of lithium and evaporation pools had always been common, which can leave layers of toxic chemicals in its wake. New methods, like this article about Utah’s Great Salt Lake, pump water out and filter it, leaving the lake largely in tact.

From Wall Street journal:

https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/great-salt-lake-lithium-startup-lilac-d84c9f76?mod=djem10point

> This summer, a California startup plans to start construction on a project to suck up water from the Great Salt Lake to extract one of its many valuable minerals: lithium

> The effort is one of dozens of projects across the U.S. racing to build up a domestic supply of lithium and other battery minerals, with adoption of electric vehicles expected to boom as part of the country’s transition to cleaner energy. The Biden administration is dedicating billions of dollars to strengthening the U.S. battery supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which dominates the global production of battery minerals.

> The challenge: finding ways to efficiently extract the mineral from rocks and water while minimizing environmental damage.

> “Lithium resources in the U.S. are very large in scale, but the chemistry is very challenging,” said Lilac founder and Chief Executive Dave Snydacker. 

> Briny water is among the most promising resources for lithium in the U.S. Exxon Mobil is drilling for lithium-laden brines deep underground in Arkansas’s Smackover region. Other companies are working to extract lithium from brines in California’s Salton Sea. 

It’s funny that oil companies are getting in on it. One of the major pitfalls of drilling for oil is you often hit saltwater first. And it was hard to dispose of it because it destroys agriculture and there was a lot of it. Like they’re leasing these drilling spots often from ranchers or agricultural areas. if they had a gusher of saltwater without properly containing it, that land would be unable to support much in the way of vegetation because it was contaminated with salt. So what had always been an annoying aspect of oil and gas drilling is trying to be leveraged into a lithium mine. And oil companies got a century or so experience of dealing with it.

> crash in prices for lithium and other battery minerals in 2023 prompted mining companies to slow expansions of projects and put new ones on hold. The delays threaten to slow the country’s push to develop its battery supply chain, even as lithium demand surges.",2024-02-12 17:09:06,2024-02-28 20:01:03.877561,16 days 02:51:57.877561,25,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ap50cb/lithium_extraction_in_usa/

1anxzjh,investing,Does anyone have a theory on why electric utilities (like $VPU) have been a lousy investment?,"Does anyone have a theory/understanding as to why electric utilities (or a basket of them like $VPU) have been a lousy investment historically?  
VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%. 
  
Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing & transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium.  
  
Secondly, what about from now into the future? 
AI is going to introduce a step-change function in electricity demand, raising multiple challenges around maintaining the electric grid while at the same time transitioning to cleaner energy. For example, compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest just behind Houston, Texas. [1]  
It is forecasted that by 2027 A.I. servers could use between 85 to 134 terawatt hours (Twh) annually. That's similar to what Argentina consumes annually. [2].

Are we going to see a re-rating of utilities eventually?

The benefit of 401k is pretax and reducing current tax liability (which in turns also has helped the last few years getting things like child tax credits) and I’m thinking of the tax savings and tax credits as returns in that sense. 

Would it be wise to pause 401k (or cut back significantly) to save for a down pay on a house? Maybe there is a better way to do this , like borrowing against my current house which has a ton of equity. I guess there is also a possible option for a loan against 401k as well but I’m not sure if that’s only allowed on a primary house.

&#x200B;

So now where do we go? I checked into Fidelity as they have branches around here, and their products from a DIY perspective which I have been doing are amazing - for people like her who don't understand what stocks are, they have target date funds and robo advisor programs - but she does want someone she can talk to in person and that's a big thing for her. They seem to have a minimum cash requirement which we are not at for their Wealth Management (500k) - and they may offer other services from what I have heard if you have 50k or more, but the reviews for local offices here are horrible - 1.5 to 2/5 stars on Google. So maybe Fidelity may be just as bad if not worse than Edward Jones from a ""advisor"" stance.

&#x200B;

Definitely do want someone who is a fiduciary. But the question is at that point how that works - because if they are independent kind of like CPAs/etc... then how would some random Fiduciary manage the ""keys"" to my wife's 401K plans and IRAs? Would I have to link accounts up and/or give them access to trade on her behalf, or would they basically tell her / us what we should do in terms of investing the money? I'm confused how this would work if the assets are not at the same place as the advisor.

&#x200B;

My biggest fear and I don't want to say this in the wrong way - but since we are DINKs and we won't have kids, that when we get old, our mental health may start to go out like POTUS style. If that happens, we may have a lot of money I would have forgotten how to manage at that age and/or fall victim to scams like many older people do. It's great being young and eager to save fees and DIY right now, but I mean I'm 38. 30 years from now I could have onsets of dementia.

One of the big cons with renting vs housing is rent prices will always go up while a 30 year fixed stays the same.

But if SP500 goes up faster than rent, and someone does not want to buy a house, wouldn't it just be good to hold SP500 and withdraw yearly to pay for a years worth of rent?

Ex. 24 years old and life expectancy is 75 = \~50 years left, which is about 600 month. 600 months of rent at 2000/mo = $1,200,000 in a lifetime.

If I had 1.2 million in SP500 RIGHT NOW (hypothetically) (and along with other assets), wouldn't it just be alright to rent forever and withdraw from the 1.2 million gradually over time to pay for the rent?

1amuds8,investing,529 accounts are over rated.,"I’m all for setting some money aside for your kids’ education. But if you do, that money is tied to a singular purpose, and you don’t even know if your kid(s) will need/use it. Use it for something else and you pay a penalty. Furthermore, that tax advantage is almost nonexistent. This is because most people don’t contribute until well after kids are born, so money has limited time to grow - the only tax advantage is on that growth part. (I recognize some states give you a break on state income taxes, but that’s small change and usually this ties you to that state’s funds, which may not make any financial sense.)

Certainly there are use cases where it makes sense - namely if you’re rich and can toss in a huge chunk right when your kid is born. Or if grandparents want to do that early in their grandkids’ lives. But I’d wager for most of us having a 529 makes almost no sense. Open a brokerage account instead.

The scenario is, an unemployed person with no other income, had invested in cryptocurrency awhile back and their investment is now at a profit of $150,000. Let’s say their cost basis was $1 for the sake of simple calculations.

Can they, by the end of 2024, sell $47,000 worth of the crypto, all under the 0% tax rate so they’ll pay $0 in taxes.

When 2025 starts, they rebuy $47,000 of the same crypto, and by the end of 2025, sell a other $94,000 worth of crypto. The net profit would be $47,000, again all under 0% tax rate.

Repeat until all investments have a net profit of $0 while still keeping the same holdings.

Is this illegal?

Edit to clarify: The goal is not to cash in profit tax free, but to turn $150,000 in profit into a holding with $150,000 cost basis, tax free. It can take as many years as it needs.

1amform,investing,"For investing in pre-IPO companies, what broker are you investing with? I am with Equityzen but considering to move to another one.","I am investing in pre-IPO companies with a broker Equityzen. When you invest with Equityzen, investments are usually structured as parts of a funds. In other words, Equityzen acquires shares of a pre-IPO company and converts it to a fund and sell it to retail investors. So what you own is a part of a fund that owns shares of a single pre-IPO company.

As you are a LLP (limited liability partnership), Equityzen has a sole discretion whether to participate in a tender offer (i.e., a process of pre-IPO company buying back their shares).

My problem is that Equityzen usually opts in tender offers. Although I made a handsome profit of 200% from tender offers over a couple of years, my expectation is not to step out with such early profit, but to hold them longer until IPO (or being sold to a big company) for a greater profit.

My another concern regarding tender offers is that pre-IPO companies may buy back a large number of shares before going for IPO to maximise the capital inflow. If Equityzen opts in tender offer at such stage, then a risk-to-reward ratio of my pre-IPO investment would be  damaged substantially.

So I am searching for a broker where I can directly own shares.

\- Which brokers are you investing with?

\- When a company goes for IPO (or sold to a bigger company), your broker updates you the news and advise your next step (e.g., how to sell your shares)?

\- does your broker also updates you major news or deal of the company such as tender offers or others?

Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your experience.

&#x200B;

EDIT: at last I am considering partially Forge (as I know only Equityzen and Forge). If anybody here is investing with Forge, please let me know your experience with this broker.

However I'm coming to the point where I want to buy a home in a year or two, and I'm realizing most of my savings is in retirement accounts and not easily accessible to me. Especially seeing stocks like AAPL and NVDA over the past decade, I'm kicking myself for not investing a good chunk in a few individual stocks a while ago which would have helped me raise a good cash savings today. My options now for raising a downpayment are either withdrawing my Roth IRA contributions, take a loan against my 401k, or saving it slowly the hard way, none of which are ideal. So this is more a warning to young people to not blindly follow advice to max out your retirement accounts, because you may have other short term goals (house, etc.) that come up that may require a chunk of savings to be available.

1al5z6y,investing,Counter party risk when when lending out stocks?,"My broker allows me to opt for the securities lending program. I have done that until know, and got a few thousand from it over time.

At the moment I have a significant position in Gorilla Technologies Group, GRRR. It has a fairly high short interest rate of 280% and the shorts are utilized 100%.

So enabling short lending would earn me a few thousand dollars every month:

But I just checked the regulations, and my broker states:  
'The provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") may not protect you as a   
lender with respect to securities loan transactions in which you lend your Fully-Paid Securities. Therefore, the collateral delivered to you (and indicated on your account statement) may   
constitute the only source of satisfaction of obligation in the event that the broker fails to return the   
securities.'  


So to me that means in the unlikely but possible event of a short squeeze the borrowing party might go belly up. I would then only receive the value of the stocks **before** the squeeze.

1al4igr,investing,The Stigma of Stock Picking,"Stock picking often gets a bad rap, therefore redditor's often default to suggesting new investors purchase the S&P or any comparable fund. Though this could be considered the safe route, it does little to teach new investors about the market as a whole. 

Stock picking is like a dark art, and is something I vowed to learn and master early on (or at least quit losing money in). Firstly, diversification is important. There's no way around it. Your level of diversification can vary, but owning an excessive amount of companies will only assure you'll do average at best.

Many give Cramer flak, but there's one comment he'd often make I'd like to highlight: ""Buy best of the best"". If you opted to buy the best companies per sector, beating the market isn't impossible...but picking stocks is half of the equation. ""Buying a wonderful company at a fair price"" is the other half.

I often stress the psychology of investing. Something I didn't become cognizant of until I started day trading. The market often pulls in new investors during euphoria, and this is the absolute worst time to invest. 

Many novice (and somewhat experienced) investors can't stomach market corrections, so be mindful of the affect a correction can have on someone who got in at the highs during euphoric conditions. A 10% drop in a stock isn't something to lose sleep over for someone who's up 100% or so...but imagine the affect a 10% drop can have on a new investor. They'll likely want to stop the bleeding, considering they'll immediately be in the red. 

Resist following the herd. Usually when some shiny new thing is being touted on social media, smart money is already looking for the exit. Invest in companies you can understand. Invest in products you already use or would consider using, granted they have sustainable growth. I often avoided shopping at Walmart because it was always crowded. I decided to research the company to determine what that traffic translated to. That was around $52 a share. I realized when you turn on every computer, you were greeted by Microsoft Windows. That was $38 a share. It can be that simple.

Investors definitely shouldn't be deterred from stock picking. Just be cognizant of the business and disciplined in your entry.

1akol5d,investing,Thinking of buying Japanese Stock. Can't decide whether to make settled currency in Dollars or Yen,"Hi.  


I asked a similar question a week or so ago, but I think I misunderstood what my brokerage is offering, so I want to see if people here can explain better. I thought having settled currency in Yen was better because it would raise my floor at the risk of lowering my ceiling due to currency fluctuations. But the brokerage person just told me something different (even though another person told me something else a couple of weeks ago when I called).  


So I am thinking of buying Japanese Stock with my US brokerage account. My brokerage account offers settled currency in US Dollars and Japanese Yen.  


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense have settled currency in Dollars or Yen.   


I thought having settled currency in dollars  meant that my investment in the site dashboard would show the Dollar equivalent when it comes to gains/ losses. So for example if the investment in yen went up 20%, but currency fluctuated where the yen got stronger, my actual investment gain in dollar might only be 15%. Whereas if it was in yen, then i would get the full 20% gain, and I only have the currency risk if i choose to convert.  


As my brokerage account is in US, it is probably more convenient to have things in dollars so that if i sell the investment, i don't need to convert to buy something like an ETF?  


Whereas if it is settled in Yen, I would have to convert back? The way the brokerage people told me was that the settled in yen make sense if you have yen in your account. I don't, but I can use the currency exchange feature to get the yen anyways.  


Does it actually matter in terms of potential gains/ losses or other Pros and Cons? The approximate exchange rate is 1 USD to 150 yen.. That is quite lopsided to the US Dollar... I do expect the yen to strengthen even if it is 1 USD to 120 or 130 yen in the future for example.   


TLDR: does it matter if i make my settled currency in Dollar vs Yen in regards to potential gains/ losses?  


Is there any pro or con that I am not aware of in buying in US dollar or Yen?

1akg3bc,investing,Physical silver investment,"I am beginning to allocate a small percentage of my portfolio towards physical silver. Here’s why: 

1. I want to diversify my portfolio beyond cash, stocks and crypto.

2. The gold/silver ratio is at 90. Meaning 90 ounces of silver buys 1 ounce of gold. Historically the average is around 70. Seems like a good time to buy silver.

3. Silver is a hedge against the USD and US financial markets. If we head into a recession, silver typically performs well. 

4. Silver is a non-digital asset. I cannot think of a physical asset that stores value better than silver, other than other precious metals or land / real estate. It has gone from $5 an ounce to $22 an ounce since 1975. It is important to me to own physical assets that will appreciate in value. 

5. It is a solid vehicle for transferring wealth to my children in the future. 

6. It’s shiny! Also, it is fun collecting certain coins if you are willing to pay an extra premium. 

7. Value stems from a myriad of industrial and medical uses.

1aka17j,investing,the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world,"The story of how oil and gas tax benefits came to be is as rich and layered as the deposits these industries tap into beneath the earth's surface. It's a tale that intertwines with the very fabric of American history, innovation, and economic strategy, revealing why today, oil and gas investments stand as some of the most undervalued and tax-efficient yields in the world.

To encourage exploration and production after the past energy crisis, the U.S. government implemented a series of tax incentives. These were not merely financial perks but strategic tools aimed at securing the nation's energy independence. The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) deduction, for example, allowed companies to deduct expenses from drilling new wells, an essential move to keep the rigs turning and the oil flowing. Similarly, the Depletion Allowance recognized the inherent decrease in value of oil and gas fields as they were depleted, offering a way to offset this loss against income.

\- The Intangible Drilling Cost (IDC) and Depletion Allowance are tax incentives for the oil and gas industry in the U.S. The IDC lets companies deduct drilling costs immediately.  
\- The Depletion Allowance reduces taxes on income from wells to account for resource depletion. Both were introduced to boost investment in oil and gas exploration, aiding U.S. energy independence efforts.

\-Lease costs, like the expenses for leasing minerals and rights, can be spread out over the lease's duration, offering tax advantages over time. Tangible Drilling Costs (TDCs) cover equipment used in drilling and can be depreciated over seven years. These tax incentives, along with the strong return on investment (ROI) potential in direct energy investments, make the sector an attractive choice for investors seeking tax efficiency and profitability.

  
These incentives did more than just stimulate growth in the oil and gas sector; they wove it into the very economic and energy fabric of the nation, making the U.S. a global energy leader. Yet, as the world shifts towards renewable energy, the narrative around oil and gas has evolved. The irony is that, in this transition, oil and gas investments have become some of the most undervalued assets, despite their continuing critical role in powering the modern world.  
Even as we champion the rise of renewables and the march towards electrification, the reality remains: the modern world continues to rely on the efficiency and flexibility of oil and gas. This is especially true as we navigate the complexities of integrating renewable sources into our energy grid, which still requires the reliability and on-demand power that fossil fuels provide. The shift to a more electric and renewable future doesn't negate the value of oil and gas; rather, it highlights their enduring importance in our energy mix.  
The tax benefits initially crafted to ensure energy independence have, somewhat unexpectedly, positioned oil and gas investments as some of the best tax-efficient yields available. Investors who recognize this stand to not only gain from the sector's undervalued status but also contribute to a balanced and pragmatic approach to our energy future.

1ak5vkk,investing,When do you know it's time to go it alone and ditch your FA?,"I started my investing journey about 10 years ago after receiving a windfall. I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA. As long as I am navigating any potential traps like not paying witholding taxes, I don't see any issues with that strategy as it's hard to beat the market. The S&P and related ETFs are gold standards for a reason, and some of the funds rebalance themselves. 

tldr; do I know enough to invest safely long-term?

I’ve got about $8,000 laying around, doing nothing in my bank account, and I’ve been looking to invest it in more index funds. I’m in my late 20s, so I want to rebalance my portfolio to have more stocks as opposed to cash.

Now, would it be better to switch to a more “traditional” account, say Fidelity (which handles my 401k, so I’ve had it in mind), or keep using Robinhood and invest the $8,000 in there, and transfer my current portfolio?

Today, it’s approaching $200, and I’m still a buyer. My thesis has not changed. Demand shocks will continue to push prices higher, even as more production capacity comes online. The most advanced chips simply cannot be made fast enough to keep up with a world that wants server-side and client-side AI training and inference on every application and device. 

Chips that aren’t optimized for AI all have to be turned over for, or at least supplemented with, chips that are. 

AI is as big as the internet, maybe even bigger. People pay upwards of $100 a month for broadband internet, and eventually, they will pay the same for AI because it will deliver so much value. That money is going to be invested in chips, chips, chips.

1ajupdn,investing,What if this scenario plays out?,"March FOMC - no rate cuts. Market may not like this, and we have a 10% correction. 

&#x200B;

This 10% correction will set the stage for a massive economic situation to play out. The Federal Reserve will not want to abandon the inflation threat, so they are going to be aggressive at keeping interest rates high while doing nothing to control the National Debt.

&#x200B;

High interest rates will actually cause the Federal Reserve to have to increase the national debt, which in turn will cause inflation to come back over the Spring and Summer 2024 months.

&#x200B;

May FOMC - no rate cuts. Market will trade flat through the summer months. Economic situation with layoffs and job cuts will get worse. Banks will start to experience stress as they will be upside down in ""Bond gambling"" at a much faster rate than March 2023.

&#x200B;

September FOMC - Federal Reserve may have to institute emergency rate cuts, even with inflation running hot at 5% once again. This will cause a massive stock market crash, and being in September - right at the seasonal low for stock markets in general. S&P 500 could correct to 2,900 by January 2025.

&#x200B;

And the scary part - inflation may end up at 6% going into 2025 even if we have a major market crash, because the interest rate hikes do not address the cause of inflation. The government will actually likely create more inflation rescuing out big banks that may fail due to interest rate pressure, and I don't really know how this ends well.",2024-02-05 23:14:04,2024-02-28 20:01:06.056625,22 days 20:47:02.056625,16,0.23,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajupdn/what_if_this_scenario_plays_out/

Am currently 24; life expectancy is about 75. I estimate about 50 years left to live, which is about 600 months. So 600 monthly rent payments instead of buying a house.  
  
Everyone in my family continues to tell me that buying is always superior to renting no matter the scenario. I'm not quite sure if this applies to my plan.  
  
I understand that buying real estate is powerful for many reasons (5x leverage 20% down, tax advantages, etc.) but what if:  
  
1. I plan to not marry or have any kids.  
  
2. I plan to ""die with zero"" meaning I want to die with as close to 0 dollars as possible since I'm not having any kids to pass any assets down to.  
  
3. I want to ""retire"" from working a job as early as possible.  
  
4. I want to have as little unnecessary stress as possible throughout the lifetime.  
  
  
The money that would have gone into the down payment and monthly mortgage would go to the SP500. Would it be reasonable to think that the SP500 will appreciate more than the real estate property? Or am I misunderstanding?  
  
My thinking with this is:  
  
1. SP500 and renting will have a lot less maintenance (no HVAC guy, no plumber, etc.)  
  
2. No property tax  
  
3. What's the point in building equity in this house if I will not pass it down to anyone? I don't want to die with 1-2 million dollars worth of house.  
  
Some possible arguments I can come up against my own point:  
  
1. monthly mortgage is fixed but rent increases in dollar amount over time (but also take into consideration that SP500 also increases in dollar amount over time)  
  
2. Possibly borrow against value of the home?  
  
3. A 20% down payment allows you to leverage (ex. You put down 200k to control a 1m asset. That's like 5x leverage and you de-leverage with each monthly payment)

1ajo5on,investing,Stock Market vs. Real Estate,"TLDR: invest $150K from HELOC into building a secondary suite on current primary residence or invest $150K into stock market?

We purchased our home in 2021. PP: $470,500. We put 20% down. Our mortgage is around $370K at 6.2% interest, variable rate. Current monthly payments are $2,100 which is basically only covering interest. Assessed value is $608K.  
  
We have put around $80K into the house in renovations and have done all the work ourselves, including the kitchen and bathroom, so there is some sweat equity in the home. A house across the street that was assessed at $672K sold for $642K a couple months ago. It is not nearly as nice as ours. I am not sure why the assessed value is higher considering ours is several sq. ft. larger, 2 floors ABOVE ground (as opposed to below ground) and we have a 2 car garage but I am definitely not going to complain (cause, property taxes).  
  
Needless to say, I do believe we have some equity in the home we'd be able to take out.  
  
We are looking to add an addition above our garage as a secondary suite. It is connected to our current home therefore it would not be classified as an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). We have had a contractor come look at it. The build would cost around $150K to add approx. 450-500 sq ft.  
  
To finance the build, we would need to borrow from a HELOC. What I've yet to understand is the interest rates on a HELOC in comparison to interest rates on our mortgage.  
  
The whole idea of this suite came about because our province is currently offering a forgivable loan up to $40,000 or 50% of construction costs, given you rent out the suite for below market rates for 5 years. 20% of the loan would be forgiven each year it is rented out. The below market rate in our area is \~$1,000/month. Therefore, we would be earning $12,000 gross rent + $8,000 loan forgiveness for the first 5 years, therefore, $100K. In addition, it is unclear whether a secondary suite would add the same amount of value to the home as it would cost. I am not sure whether a $150K suite would add $150K to our eventual sale price. However, since it is our principal residence, also consider the entire gain on the home would be excluded except for the rental portion of the property. Therefore, 450sq ft / 2,600 sq ft x cap gain on sale x (# of years lived in / # of years owned +1 year) = taxable gain x 50% effective tax rate (currently, 18%, but will increase).  
  
We live in a boaters/sledders town. The summer months are VERY busy in our community and winter brings about sledders too. After the 5-year period, we could airbnb the secondary suite and earn even more rental income.  
  
My partner asked 'well what would $150K look like if we invested it rather than built this secondary suite?' She is very against sharing a wall or any of our property with other people. My father-in-law gave me an example that conservatively, every 7 years your investment should double. Therefore, in 7 years $150K should = $300K.

1ajfcmh,investing,CD/HYSA vs Inflation! Does it ever beat it out?,"I understand savings accounts and CDs are not for investing. I understand that. But I am someone with basically zero risk tolerance, and I hate the idea of locking away money for 5-10+ years to get a relatively safe return through various investments (S&P 500 for example). Even a very small risk of losing money over time is a scary thought. Although I know it’s almost guaranteed to be better than CDs/HYSA in the long term. I still can’t help but prefer the safety that especially CDs provides.

Im just wondering if you strategically go for the highest rates offered whether HYSA or CDs, and use CD laddering when rates are high, if it can generally beat inflation in the long term. The last few years it’s clear it hasn’t. As inflation and available interest rates where very disproportionate. However recently with savings accounts offering 4+% and cds over 5% it seems to be an actual safe investment that at least slightly beats out inflation. although still very low when accounting for after tax profit.

But in the long term is it a bad idea to try and strategically use cds/hysa as a way of beating inflation? Especially when accounting for profit loss from taxes? Is it only ever a way of slowing down the effects of inflation rather than beating it? 

TLDR: Scared of losing money to inflation. Will CDs/HYSA generally at least keep up with it in the long term?",2024-02-05 12:29:18,2024-02-28 20:01:06.056724,23 days 07:31:48.056724,76,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ajfcmh/cdhysa_vs_inflation_does_it_ever_beat_it_out/

1ajchbw,investing,My company is allowing some staff to buy shares. What do I ask to find out more?,"My company (private not public) told me today that high-performing staff are being given the option to buy shares in the company.   


The problem I have is that this is being taken out of our bonus, and we have the option to use a fixed percentage of our bonus (25% or 50%) to buy shares.  


On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.   


The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.   


All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?  


Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.

1. Investment management (largely passive, sophisticated hands on management including tax loss harvesting, building out individual bond ladders, providing access to alternative investment opportunities like late stage venture capital, real estate, and private equity). 
2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they’d need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire. 
3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way. 
4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly.
5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can’t manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments. 

I feel like I do a lot for my AUM fee, which starts at 0.65% and declines to 0.4% at $10M. However, it doesn’t seem like the world thinks very highly of what I do for a living.

Namely, these values are very high, hundreds of millions, what would happen if somebody random decided to invest $100mm, or more, in a company? Surely, somebody at a brokerage, the CFO, and the IRS would see a trade for 30 million+ shares of a company and investigate, right?

1aim9bn,investing,Index fund: What are historical returns for quarterly vs monthly dollar cost averaging,"Main questions:
1)Is there a historical returns calculator where I can compare results for quarterly dollar cost averaging vs monthly? 
I could only find calculators with a monthly one. 

2)Historically,are returns higher if you dollar cost average monthly vs quarterly? 

Background/context


The reason why I am asking this is simple: I am buying NASDQ and S&P500 based in Eurooean stock exchanges because they have to be UCITs compliant and none of those are available in US stock markets. 

These ETFs are identical to the ones traded in the US and have barely any differences in returns unless they are hedged to another currency which increases or decreases returns based on the exchange rate. 

European stock exchanges have high comissions and clearing fees and bigger volumes mean it's cheaper for me to invest quarterly vs monthly.

The second reason I invest quarterly is because I need to maintain a high amount of savings for a number of reasons and that treshold is a minimum of 9 months of savings. 

I could list those reasons but that would make this post unnecessarily long.

To select individual stocks, I use several websites to collect the appropriate information and to be able to filter for certain characteristics. I am now subscribed to FastGraphs basic and I also use the free versions of Yahoo Finance, Barchart, Finviz and tradingview for the technical part.

  
I spend quite a lot of time gathering information from several places, so I thought I'd rather subscribe to a website where I can put together a couple of screeners, so I don't have to jump between several pages and I can find the companies that may be relevant to me faster.

  
Info I need: at least 8-10 years of income, expenses, profit, forecasts, historical valuation indicators, Current ratio, ROA, ROE indicators for each company would be available.  
So far, I have collected them in Excel, this is quite a lengthy process, but at least I have seen the companies of the given sector side by side with all relevant indicators.

  
Lately, I mostly use finviz, but unfortunately there is no European share on this site, or only very limited ones. Regardless, I like and am thinking about Finviz Elite.

  
Since then, I've heard about gurufocus and many people have recommended it, but I don't know if it's worth the $450 a year.

  
Also, there is the premium version of FastGraphs, which costs quite a bit, and I don't know if it would be worth the similar price as Gurufocus, seeing the professionalism of GF.

1ai3xt5,investing,US Treasury Bond vs. Global Aggregate Bond ETF when treasury has higher yield,"Aggregate bond funds seem to be the usual recommendation for the bond component in a portfolio.  To compare them with treasury, I looked into the [Vanguard USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VUTA)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9598/usd-treasury-bond-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) and the [Vanguard Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF (USD Hedged) (VAGU)](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/bond/9600/global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf-usd-hedged-accumulating).

Characteristics | VUTA (Treasury) | VAGU (Global Aggregate)
-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------
Effective Yield to Maturity | 4.10% | 3.80%
Average Maturity          | 7.9 years | 8.8 years
Average Duration          | 6.2 years | 6.8 years
Average Quality | AA+ | AA-
TER | 0.07% | 0.10%

I thought the higher YTM and (presumably) lower default risk mean that VUTA will have a higher expected return, but [Vanguard's own 10-year forecast](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html) predicts a better return from global bonds instead:

Forecast |U.S. aggregate bonds|Global bonds ex-U.S. (hedged)|U.S. Treasury bonds

10Y return projection|4.8%-5.8%|4.7%-5.7%|4.4%-5.4%
Median volatility|5.60%|4.40%|5.90%

Where can the \~1% excess return possibly come from? And when combined with stock funds in a portfolio, should I pick VUTA based on the higher effective YTM and a lower market correlation, or VAGU due to a higher predicted return despite the lower effective YTM? Thanks for your help.

I can see how someone with a huge load of debt would want enough life insurance to cover paying those loans off when they die so their family is not stuck with the loans - but when you are on the other end of that bridge debt free, I just don't see any benefit at all to life insurance if you have cash that will be passed along to beneficiaries.

Looking to increase my investment risk , however need to manage it very strategically. I'm looking for resources, either books, links, software, or the likes to create a dashboard to manage investment conditions such as:

- specify buy and sell conditions 
- hedge risks 
- simulate different stock combinations and their outcomes 
- options strategy and simulate the possible outcomes

I also plan to sell the property in 3-5 years, although that is not a certainty (I may hold it for longer). 

I have plenty of cash sitting in a HYSA and I’m wondering it it makes sense to pay extra toward the principal each month or even as a lump sum right now. I could obviously invest that capital in other ways, and since I’m expecting that interest rates will drop I wonder if it’s worth doing.

My understanding at the moment is that it kind of doesn’t matter, but I’d appreciate hearing some opinions to the contrary. If I didn’t have conviction that interest rates would drop, I figure it would be sensible to pay off the loan faster. If I had a (much) better rate, I’d think paying it more slowly would obviously be more advantageous.

34M located in NY.  305k in 401/457 accounts total as of today. 

Railroad employee for 10 years. 20 more to go and I will meet the requirement for retiring as a railroad conductor (30 years of service and age 55 minimum to collect a NYS defined pension with the MTA with no penalty. 60% of average of top 3 consecutive years in your last 10 of service. It is subject to cost of living increased)

Current pay 50 dollars an hour, with eye dental and medical all covered by employer. (Labor Contract expired by 2 years so we are due for a raise and retro). Also have had the options for overtime. 

I do not pay in to social security, I pay into railroad retirement. If I have 30 years of railroad service in my life, I will be able to collect my full railroad retirement pension as well at 60 years old instead of 62.  I believe it pays much more than Social Security, and is privately funded by the railroads so hopefully I am safe in the future with that.  My wife will be able to collect an additional 50% of my 100% regardless of if/ any she pays into social security.  Railroad retirement will either pay her  or allow her to collect SS come age if their payout is higher. 

My employer does not match anything into the 401(k) or 457, but they give me the option to have both. They provide the defined pension when I retire from service at 55 years old until I die, then my spouse takes over the payouts. They also cover my medical until I turn 65.  

I’m sure they do not match because they are providing with a defined pension.

I will not discuss my saving size as I have invested a lot into my house I purchased in 2022 because I bought it for a deal so I needed to provide a lot of equity upfront.   It needed an addition and lots of renovations. 


My only debt is my mortgage which is at 220,000 currently. Both cars are paid off and I have no credit card debt.

My biggest concern is the 401/457 when it comes time at 60 years old and am able to start using it, or if I die leave it to my family. I have a 300k life insurance policy as well. 

Does it look like I should be in a decent position? Any advice is appreciated.

I’m currently living in the East Coast and work as a software engineer making about $80K/year (company is based in the south). 

I’ve been dabbling with investing for the past 5 years and have learned a lot and been successful at it (I don’t do trading, just invest). I’m currently sitting on about $180K liquid and $50K in investments that I plan on keep using and hopefully, increasing in value.

I’ve checked out https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/early_career and some of the stuff there doesn’t necessarily apply to me: 

- Debt free

- I’m already married

- Neither me nor my wife want any children

- We’re not planning on buying a home.

My employment gives me a $401K and I’m using that but the question now comes to where to park my $180K

Due to the current state of the stock market, my thought process was to place $120K in a HYSA ($100K locked in a CD for 6 months and $30K in regular savings) and keep $50K liquid in my spending account as an emergency fund.  Overtime, once the general market corrects I was planning on moving the $100K into something longer term, perhaps a Roth IRA? But not 100% sure.

I’m slightly concerned that I don’t have enough to build a reasonable amount by the time I want to retire. Was curious about my plan and if it makes sense or if I’m way off.

1agpkph,investing,"42 yrs old, $2.55M saved - 8 years of investments in VTSAX are stuck with average cost basis - how do I account for this when determining if I’m ready to retire early?","
According to a few calcs I’m confident in my ability to retire within the next 0-3 years though I’m still unsure. 

42 yrs old, $2.55M saved between brokerage and retirement accounts and misc, including $45k cash. i’m single, no kids, no debt, renter. 

AA is 72/28 though some have told me to get more aggressive. 

Currently unemployed due to a layoff. 

Annual budget is $52k and accounts for increasing healthcare expenses, though doesn’t account for the cost of a retirement home or hospice. 

Specific question: A while back I moved my brokerage to a new institution and unknowingly locked about 8 years of VTSAX covered shares into average cost basis. The rest of my brokerage is SpecID. The 8 years of VTSAX is a hefty portion of my brokerage. This means less control over cap gains and fewer chances to TLH. How do I take this into account when determining whether I’m ready to retire early? Is it relevant for a FIRE calculation? 

Vision is to retire from full time work and do part time consultant work to cover at least some of my costs. Other income would be dividends and interest income totaling about $30k (and climbing over time).",2024-02-01 23:52:51,2024-02-28 20:01:07.290340,26 days 20:08:16.290340,52,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1agpkph/42_yrs_old_255m_saved_8_years_of_investments_in/

In my 401k I have some growth funds but still mostly total market funds. I have meet with a few financial advisors and until very recently never even considered it.
The last one I met with proposed a few changes with justifications that resonated with me. The idea was a flat ($900) fee for overall wealth planning, looking at my portfolio and making suggestions that I go and do but not doing any transactions for me. The fee would remain the same forever and be inclusive of advice for all of my money.  Some of the portfolio analysis made sense as to how I could get slightly better returns. 
My main question is at what point is it worth it to have a financial advisor as certain topics like retirement planning, what to sell to buy a house, tax loss harvesting are all topics I don’t know as much about. $900 is no small amount but it is less than 1% of what they would be advising on now and if they make  me .5% a year extra over time it is well worth it.

It's been doing well for me but I have a friend that advocates dumping my etfs and focusing on more tech etfs. Over the past couple years his gains have absolutely obliterated mine, but as a long term investor, this doesn't really bother me. That being said, historically speaking, tech sector does seem to GENERALLY outperform the broad market. I've always heard that you really shouldn't try to beat the S&P over the long term because most people who try fail. This is advice I have always agreed with but it seems like tech sector does actually generally beat S&P. You can obviously cherry pick examples of when it doesn't, but you would need to do just that, cherry pick. The fact that my friends portfolio has been obliterating mine, in combination with the historical data (I initially thought it was just recency bias) I am starting to think his strategy might be better. I also happen to believe in the future of tech, I think the sector will look very different as time goes on but a future in which tech isn't the dominant market sector seems a bit unfathomable. It's nothing like the sectors of old, it certainly would not have been unfathomable to me that oil might one day not be the dominant sector. I also don't really consider Tech a ""sector"" it's more like multiple sectors under one umbrella so it has some inherent diversification. My mindset around diversification is shifting from diversification = good to diversification = important investing tool but can be both good and bad. I know some people who diversify so much that their gains are not much better than simply having a high yield savings account... in that case just get a high yield savings account lol. Lastly, because Tech is such a dominant sector, if tech goes down I feel like my diversification won’t really save me. My losses may be a little less extreme, but probably not much.

1ag1844,investing,EVs and metal stocks. What are you bullish on long term?,"EV stocks are bleeding out and I don't expect that to slow down anytime soon. If you ask me, the EV revolution will end up morphing into a hybrid revolution as the most realistic short term outcome. Lithium has also taken a hit over the last few months but the industry will be riffed with aggressive consolidation via M&A throughout 2024 - this might favor a lot of US/nearshore junior miners.

Is now a good time to accumulate lithium while it's cheap? I mean, the green transition will ultimately be heavily dependent on lithium as a foundational metal (car batteries, electronics, etc). There are also no real viable replacements (sodium-ion, hydrogen cells, etc are just liquidity traps / R&D grant money syphoning affinity scams). I'm increasing my exposure to lithium miners across the board. (LIFT.v and ALB are my two main growth plays).  


What is your long term thesis on EVs and Lithium? Are you bullish?

1afdxe0,investing,Let's be real - Are we underestimating the risk of index funds in the long run?,"I say this as someone invested in the index. Are we underestimating the risk of index funds in the long run? It seems on every financial subreddit, the advice is usually to invest in index funds. This is good, for now... but past performance is not an indicator of future performance. And each year, we are heading closer towards a market future dominated by index funds, an index fund tracking the index funds.

I think two very real possibilities that people need to consider in this future index fund dominated market; either a), the returns will be much lower due to too much passive investing or b) actively managed funds will out-perform passive investing.

Imagine a world dominated by index funds. If I buy stock from any company (even a bad one) I will drive up its share price and thus its index weight and force the passive investors along, which will further drive up the price at which I can sell a bit later, so I can easily front run the passive investors and will massively outperform them.  
Passive investing is depending on enough active investment happening, it needs to be in an equilibrium, if there is too much going on on the passive side, the active investors have a front-running advantage that will outweigh their higher cost of operations and they will outperform passive. If there are many active investors their front-running advantage is too small to outweigh their cost, and passive investors will outperform them because of that. That is the situation we're still in. 

With the increasing success of index funds and ETFs... is the future of index funds more uncertain than we think?",2024-01-31 09:22:01,2024-02-28 20:01:07.290636,28 days 10:39:06.290637,258,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1afdxe0/lets_be_real_are_we_underestimating_the_risk_of/

Point 1: So, first of all, there are two ways a person can make money off a stock: Either through dividends, or having the stock appreciate in value, and then selling it. Am I right to say that?

Let’s look at stocks without dividends. 

Point 2: A stock’s price is ultimately moved only by supply and demand. It doesn’t matter how successful a company is. At the end of the day, a stock’s price will only go up if there is demand for the stock. Am I right to say that?

Point 3: People buy stocks in hopes of the stock price increasing, but a stock’s price only increases when people buy the stock. 

With point 3 in mind, it leads to my final question, what drives the demand for stock in the first place?

1aezfz6,investing,Need help making sense of bond pricing,"Edit 2: solved!

----

I understand how a simple bond works, and I half-remember the discounted cashflow formula I was taught in university, but these only apply to bonds held to maturity. I'm trying to grok pricing of bonds that are being (re)sold at the market.

I opened up the ""bonds"" tab and the first result (alphabetically) was [Austria 2.1% 17/17, ISIN: AT0000A1XML2](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/at0000a1xml2-oesterreich-republik-2-1-17-17). Not exactly a great example as it is a government bond and probably influenced by EU policies at large, but oh well. What I see is:

- Bond pricing on start date: marked as ""100"" (?), as in ""a share of the bond costs 100€ to buy"". 
- Maturity: When you get back the 100€ you paid on start date, in ~93 years.
- Coupon (2.1%): You get 2.1% per year until maturity on the 100 invested (or 2.1€).
- Price: How much you need to pay to buy that 1 share today, i.e. ~74€.

I hope that's okay so far. Now comes the guesswork:

- Yearly: If I buy that bond at ~74€, the 2.1% coupon rate, then my expected yield is 2.1€ / 74€ = 2.837% per year
- At maturity: I get paid 100€

With the above, I can calculate the value: sum of all coupons until maturity, plus initial capital, or `93 * 2.1 + 100 = 295.3`. Then, I need to discount by **only one** (?) semi-magical number which I can pick as either inflation or the ""risk-free asset"" or any alternative asset (e.g. S&P500)? E.g. say I pick 2%, I would calculate the present value something like this: `295.3 / (1.02  ^ 93) ~= 46.82`.\*\*

Does that make any sense? Am I missing something? And \*if the above *is* correct (plus/minus some number variation), is that how bond pricing mostly works, and are the discrepancies in present value vs price the expected loss/reward?

Edit: 

\*\* Discounting based on time as the first comment suggests and verifying my calculations [using a calculator](https://www.calculator.net/finance-calculator.html?ctype=startingamount&cyearsv=93&cinterestratev=2&cstartingprinciplev=20%2C000&ccontributeamountv=-2.1&ctargetamountv=-100&cpy=1&ccy=1&ciadditionat1=end&printit=0&x=Calculate#cr) as the other comment suggested, the present value is ~104.21",2024-01-30 21:09:46,2024-02-28 20:01:07.290689,28 days 22:51:21.290690,9,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aezfz6/need_help_making_sense_of_bond_pricing/

1aerz0n,investing,Calculating Net Investment/ACB,"Anyone else do this or find logic in this ideology to keep track of their net investments or am I just misleading myself.

E.g.

I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment

The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600

I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB’s for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows

16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share
1 AMD = about $90/share

MSFT trading at $410
AMD trading at $178

Essentially since I didn’t add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.

Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what i’ve put in as net investments.

the numbers that they get are not accurate.

on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT

This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.

I work in the public sector in Ohio. My employer uses OPERS which, as far as I can tell, I have no control over. It’s set based on my hours or pay.  So that is what it is but because I’m in the public sector I also have access to the Ohio Deferred Comp where I have a 457 plan set up. 

Right now I’m interested in maximizing the performance of the money I’m putting into the 457 and also setting up a Roth 457 plan also through Ohio DC. 

When I get to the screen where I can make selections for how the money is allocated I am completely lost.  The regular 457 plan is set up for the LifePath 2050 portfolio however after listening to some Ramsey videos I think I want to change it up to spreading my allocations evenly across large, mid, small cap mutual funds and also international. I’m guessing I should mirror that for my Roth 457. 

Where I get stuck is on the Ohio DC website there are multiple options under each of the categories I mentioned above and have no idea which to pick or how to determine which to pick which brings me here. 

I will list out what the options are below if someone could shed some light on what the differences are and provide any guidance on how to pick the right ones. 

Large Company Stock options:
- Fidelity Growth Company CP
- Fidelity Contrafund CP
- US Large Growth Company Stock
- US Large Value Company Stock
- US Large Company Stock Index

Small company/Mid Company Stock
- US Small Growth Company Stock
- US Small Value Company Stock
- US Small/Mid Company Stock Index
- Vanguard Capital Opportunity 

Non-US Stock
- Non-US Company Stock
- Non-US Company Stock Index

1ae6dpv,investing,Merits of buying foreign stock in foreign currency vs US currency.,"I'm having a hard understanding how it would affect my gains if I buy in foreign currency vs my normal USD currency, and why one would buy with one or the other. I'm not talking about OTC or ADR, or the pink sheet. I am talking about buying actual stock on the actual foreign exchange.

So if I am using USD and JPY as example:

If I buy in USD, the % gain or unrealized gain I see already includes the potential gains/ loss from the changes of the currency exchange rate between the two currency at that point in time (built in currency exchange risk is reflected)?

Whereas if I buy in yen, the % gain or unrealized gain I see is the gain from the investment only. The actual gain/ loss could be greater/ lower depending on whether the yen got stronger or weaker compared to my initial investment currency exchange rate (currency exchange rate is not reflected)?

and if i expect the yen to strengthen to the dollar, buying in yen would hedge against currency risk at the cost of slightly lower gains? This would mean higher floor and lower ceiling?

Does it matter if, when/if I withdrawal, I'll be withdrawing in USD (as I can't use Yen in the US) anyways that I have it in one currency or the other? Because to me, the actual money I'll be getting in the end is the same, it is just a matter of whether the % gain of the portfolio is higher/lower due to currency fluctuation... though if I buy in USD, and the currency fluctuation decreases my % gain, maybe I might pay less taxes?

Like let say I buy at the same time and sell at the same time, my real gain/losses would be the same if I were to buy with Dollars or yen (convert back to dollars after sell) right? Lets say actual investment gains is 10%, but currency gains/losses X%.

If I buy with dollars, the % gain/losses I see on the website would be the 10% + X% or 10%-X% built in already right?

Whereas the yen, the % gain and losses I see on the website would only be the 10%, and I would need to factor in the X% movement on the currency?

So it basically doesn't matter at the end?",2024-01-29 21:13:05,2024-02-28 20:01:08.614843,29 days 22:48:03.614843,4,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ae6dpv/merits_of_buying_foreign_stock_in_foreign/

For me, I’m still a bit iffy, which leads me to not buy into it. I still don’t see any real value in bitcoin all together. Yet, it’s enticing to buy into bitcoin, dispite its high volatility, to make huge profit. Only problem is, bitcoin is not backed by anything. Not a lot of stores even except bitcoin as payment systems.                                       
Even though bitcoin ETF has been around for quite a long time, its approval by the SEC could have many impacts in the future. But it could also lead to huge complications to bitcoin itself as for what its purpose is. If so many non-bitcoin investors begin to invest in this ETF, this could possibly lead to the government approval of bitcoin.

1adwg9t,investing,Stock Ownership - Capital Gains vs Dividends,"Hi everyone,

I would like to get a bit of insight from you guys concerning the real purpose of stock ownership.

Traditionally, one purchased public traded stocks to become an equity owner of a company. And, as an owner -- albeit a very, very small stakeholder -- you received your share of the company's profits as a dividend. Today, this still true.

However, for the past many, many decades, the most popular way to earn a return on your stock investment for companies that don't pay a dividend is solely through capital gains. The capital gains don't come from the company, but from whatever you sell your shares to.

My question is, how can a stock shareholder be an ""owner"" of the a public traded company, if the return comes from a buyer via capital gains, versus the truest way to be an ""owner"" through dividends?

It makes sense that dividends are your share of the company's profits. But, with capital gains from a stock that doesn't pay dividends, you aren't profiting from the company's profits like a real owner.

Capital gains are simply the price another person is willing to pay  The capital gains aren't fringe the company.

Furthermore, the only legal thing a company gas to do concerning your shares is to pay you the PAR VALUE of those shares as stated in the company's financial statements.

So, if you own one share of a stock that is currently trading as $50 a share, that stock's par value could be something like $0.0001 per share for example.

What are your opinions and insights concerning this issue?

Does relying on capital gains really make you an equity owner in a company that doesn't pay dividends?

Thanks!

1adv1k3,investing,"(HELP)Not Understanding a certain part of the book ""Liar's Poker""","""One of the benevolent hands doing the stuffing belonged to the Federal Reserve. That is ironic, since no one disapproved of the excesses of Wall Street in the 1980s so much as  the chairman of the Fed, Paul Volcker. At a rare Saturday press conference, on October 6, 1 ?79, Volcker announced that the money supply would cease to fluctuate with the business cycle; money supply would be fixed, and interest rates would float. The event, I think, marks the beginning of the golden age of the bond man. Had Volcker never pushed through his radical charge in policy, the world would be many bond traders and one memoir the poorer. For in practice, the shift in the focus of monetary policy meant that interest rates would swing wildly. Bond prices move inversely, lockstep, to rates of interest. Allowing interest rates to swing wildly meant allowing bond prices to swing wildly. Before Volcker's speech, bonds had been conservative investments, into which investors put their savings when they didn't fancy a gamble in the stock market. After Volcker's speech, bonds became objects of speculation, a means of creating wealth rather than merely storing it. Overnight the bond market was transformed from a backwater into a casino.

1adavih,investing,Can big crowdfunding companies be sued for their incorrect valuations of start-up companies which lead to failed investment? Seedrs and AllPlants,"I am a normal investor who is still learning, back in 2020 COVID times I tried different approach to invest into startup company which was advertised on my delivery box. I used to be AllPlants subscriber box meal. I remember large 6, 1000 calorie meals which were vegan and super tasty cost £59 so during COVID I subscribed due to lack of time to cook

My box had a leaflet saying we are crowdfunding and it was during times when everything was climbing up in price, people forgot about fears of recession and everyone felt like was in the mood to buy so they don't miss out on bargains.

AllPlants crowdfunding went so well in first stage mainly because they advertised as 20% share price discount so I think they raised 3.4m they beat few records. There were headlines. Even UK prime minister was seen with AllPlants box delivery outside.

I bought into that stage £1,000 EIS. Valuation was at £17.51 per share so I guess their real valuation was £22 per share as I was getting 20% discount.

Valuation of shares came at £25.89 later in 2021

In 2022 I bought another £1,000 worth now at £25.89 stupidly thinking I already made 30% profit they might have potential to grow.

For some reason mid 2022 things were going down and negative outlook on media made me realise I want to cash in on my A2 EIS shares I bought at £17.51 so I started selling them as they were available to sell on Seedr website.

I managed to offload about £1000 worth of shares at about 10-20% loss just trying to get rid of them but getting later to end of 2022 Seedr disabled AllPlants to be on secondary market so I was no longer able to place orders for people to buy. I was confused, as I remember it was something to do with valuations and AllPlants cannot be on secondary market due to some regulations.

I stopped putting effort into selling and forgot about this account fast forward to 2024 I thought I'd login to see what my shares are doing and if I can sell or did they grow.

Turns out in July 2023 valuation of AllPlants and new share price came at £1.61 can you believe it? 
So 29 Sept 2021 is £25.89
But on 5 July 2023 is £1.61

I can imagine what you already thinking, when you invest into start ups and do crowdfunding it is only your fault to invest into something so fragile but thinking more about this situation making me realise this was like investing into crypto or penny stocks but we are talking about food delivery company which still delivers today.

I am not even angry about losing £900 ish, it was rather a lesson but what makes me angry and confused is how is it possible that Seedr biggest crowdfunding website in UK gets away with it. How is it possible they came and valued AllPlants at 89,000,000 but 2 years later they said this company is worth 9,000,000. After all Seedrs website says ""selected and managed by experts"". 

I don't know much about startup companies but I understand during COVID their sales must of been higher and I can guess their sales are way lower logically but why can the experts get away with valueing companies wrongly and overinflate prices and then investors lose money.

Almost feels like their website slogan is wrong instead of saying
""Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest""
Should say 
""We will make sure that you lose money after we over inflate the valuation of the company you invest in then drop it down to normal value""


And you could say my shares were diluted and I received extra shares, no after holding 97 shares I recieved only 9 shares due to dilution and instead of portfolio value of roughly £900-1000 it is now worth £83.41.

Surely these things need to be regulated or normal investors will lose big money the fact that when I tried to sell AllPlants shares and seedr disabled them on secondary market sounds dodgy.

1ad4z23,investing,Thoughts on Atlas Engineering Products stock?,"It's a company that manufactures trusses, wall systems, and floor systems from wood. It has plants in Nanaimo, Ontario, Manitoba, and I'm pretty sure New Brunswick.

Currently I believe the company is undervalued and it's been doing very well in a high interest environment which leads me to believe that when rates start dropping in the second half of 2024 they will continue to do well. 

Another factor is that Canada is low on houses for our population so this will be another factor of several years of AEP helping with the builds.

I work as a Carpenter and over the last couple years most of the residential sites I'm on get all the wall and floor systems delivered to site and then they just get craned in and installed, super easy and efficient. This saves tons of money on labour and material. Not to mention there's a skilled trades shortage so there's not always someone available to frame the walls by hand, if layouts are complete anyone can fly in a wall.

I see this company going to $2 by the end of the year and in 10 years I can see $20.

1ad4o5w,investing,Ethical Investing - seeking advice on how to buy into industries I support and avoid those I don't,"I want to invest in industries/businesses I personally support and avoid those I don't. But I also see how the companies that I don't support are perfectly poised to be industry leaders in the fields I do support.

For example, I do not support fossil fuels, but rather want to focus on renewable energy. I say this knowing full well that ExxonMobil or Shell would be first in line to shift their entire business strategy to wind/solar as soon as it becomes the more profitable option.

Same with cannabis and tobacco. I hate cigarettes and fully support cannabis legalization and want to ride that wave up to the top. But I just know Philip Morris is gonna move a significant portion of their production line to cannabis once the government makes it feasible to be the biggest player in that field.

And in terms of defense and arms stocks, I hate guns and war. Yet I know that peace isn't possible without countries arming themselves to the teeth to prevent invasion, and fully support the defense of Ukraine and Israel. Plus, you can't really buy ""peace"" stocks.

Add to this the fact that the majority of desirable index funds and ETFs all include those less-ethical stocks (and crypto which I also hate). I don't see any reasonable way to avoid them without cherrypicking stocks like I'm shopping at the financial equivalent of a health food store.

1acfjuy,investing,Help! 5 days left to decide whether to exercise company stock options.,"
I was laid off. Company used to be public but was acquired by two major private equity firms just before I started working there. 

I have 1500 NSOs (non qualified options), exercise price is $10. Fair market value is not disclosed by the company but documentation says: The exercise price per Common Unit to be purchased upon exercise of an Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date.

The company doesn’t offer an exchange. Liquidity only comes with them going public again. 

If I exercise, the company has the right to repurchase at the current fair market value. Also, if I exercise, and the company does not repurchase, I will hold them until a sale event, if one occurs. 

How can I assess the fair market value? I read the company can reprice options at any time. 

Tax implications of NSOs mean two rounds of taxation, similar to RSUs I think:

When you exercise your company stock options, you’ll be taxed on the difference between your strike price (fixed purchase price) and the current FMV of those stock options

If you sell your stock within a year of when you exercised your options, you’ll pay short-term capital gains tax on any increase in value since the exercise date. If you sell after more than a year, you pay long term capital gains tax. 

I have the cash to cover the options (the cost is a small portion of my total portfolio value) though it’s hard to say whether this is a smart move. The company is a leader in its market and the private equity firms are big players who clearly want to set up the company for M&A.

1ac8mnt,investing,"Relative value of two investements, wich one is better?","Hey guys, here is the dilemna:  
You are given two choices to invest your savings:  
A) You get 10$  
B) 50% chance of getting 20$, otherwise 0$  
Mathematically wise, this is the same. However I was questionning two things:  
First, risk of course. I think people in general would prefer having 10$ each time rather than 20$ half of the time.  
Second, marginal value. IF you did econ in your life, you know that the more you get something, the less it is ""useful"" (marginal utility is a concave function). Thus, in our case, choice B would give less utility than choice A. In that case, how much money would, if divided by two give the same utility as 10$ each time. (Let there be a choice C where:  
U(10$) = U(X$)/2  
U(1000$) = U(X$)/2  
U(10000000$) = U(X$)/2  
Provided this, we can observe that X is not constant but a function. (People wouldnt really care about receiving 2$ 50% of the time instead of 1$ but would care if they received 100M 50% of the time instead of 50M).  
Does a function already exist about this?  
What do you guys think?

1ac2io7,investing,Expect More Bank Failures as BTFP Expires,"Expect More Bank Failures as BTFP Expires 

By Hermes Lux

The banking sector will soon experience another wave of failures and consolidation as the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a lifeline for struggling banks, is set to expire in March 2024. 

The BTFP is a Fed program that provides loans of up to one year to eligible depository institutions (mostly small banks) pledging collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks. The program was created in March 2023, after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, to lend to other banks that had big unrealized losses on their holdings of government bonds and were, therefore, at risk of large-scale withdrawals of deposits. The Fed has no plans to renew the BTFP for a very specific reason. 

The BTFP has helped many banks survive the past year with surging interest rates, which caused a significant decrease in the market value of the U.S. Treasury and government-backed mortgage securities held by banks. However, the program is scheduled to end in March, leaving many banks vulnerable to liquidity and solvency problems. Some of these smaller banks are likely to fail in Spring 2024.

According to a recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank last year cost the agency $18.7 billion. The FDIC imposed a special assessment on 114 financial institutions totaling $16.3 billion to recover lost funds, but they know the money will never be recovered. That’s the whole point. JPMorgan Chase $JPM, Bank of America $BAC, Wells Fargo $WFC, and Citigroup $C paid the largest assessments, which dragged on fourth-quarter earnings, as expected and as according to plan.

These are the 4 largest banks in the US with more than $12 Trillion in assets combined.  These four banks are too big to fail. Behind the scenes it is also these four banks that make up the majority of the direct influence of the cartel that is the Federal Reserve System, which, despite its name, is not Federal nor is it a government system. 

Recently, the FDIC warned that more bank failures are expected in March and April 2024, as many smaller banks are unable to repay their BTFP loans or cope with the rising debt burden. The agency said that it is working closely with the Federal Reserve (the Cartel) and other regulators (US Treasury) to monitor the situation and ensure the stability of the banking system. In other words, it’s for the greater good, and in the end, the bank consolidation will justify the decision by the FDIC, Treasury and the Fed. 

Ultimately , the Fed is trying to consolidate small banks into larger ones, as part of its strategy to reduce the systemic risk and complexity of the financial sector. The central bank (cartel) is said to be offering incentives and regulatory relief to encourage mergers and acquisitions among lesser banks, especially those with assets below $10 billion.

The banking industry Is facing a critical moment, as the expiration of the BTFP will likely trigger another round of failures and consolidation. The outcome of this process will have significant implications for the economy, the financial system, and the depositors. 

What does this mean for the markets? In one word, volatility. A crash of some kind, certainly. 

The Fed will likely be forced to lower interest rates and/or flood the markets with more liquidity causing a rise in inflation.

Be warned and be ready. $VIX.",2024-01-27 04:36:52,2024-02-28 20:01:08.615240,32 days 15:24:16.615241,68,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ac2io7/expect_more_bank_failures_as_btfp_expires/

2. index tracked fund: Classic VOO. If it’ll get put in there and not touched over 30+ years, I know it’ll grow (assuming S&P do what S&P do). Again, without running down a rabbit hole would this outperform a consistent DRIP account?

3. Classic 3 fund strategy: Whole market, Foreign Market, Bonds. Safe, boring, and bonds which in a retirement account sounds useless. But you get the point….any 2,3,3+1 account based off of “diversification” and safe investment

If the price drops to 150 (kind of unlikely) I'll probably take a position based on the premise that the valuation is more justified and that there is potential for exponential growth in robotics",2024-01-26 17:22:48,2024-02-28 20:01:08.615318,33 days 02:38:20.615318,57,0.28,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1abno5w/long_on_tsla_equity_waiting_for_another_dip/

1abkynn,investing,Managed account vs. Indexing,"My mother, who is 78, has her  investments (mostly non-registered) managed by the private investment arm of one of the big 5 Canadian banks for 25 years. Their returns have been around 5% after fees of ~1.2%. Each year I wonder if she should cut them loose and just create a DIY portfolio of SPY ETF and a bond ETF. She definitely would've had higher returns that way, as their stock picking hasn't been great for the equity portion (50%).

My question is, should she cut ties with the portfolio management approach in favour of a DIY approach? A concern is there would be a large capital gains tax to pay by having to liquidate all those equity positions, some of which have been held for many years with unrealized gains. In other words, would the short-term pain be worth the potential longer-term (10 years?) gain?

1abie8p,investing,Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),"Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.

# Company Overview:

Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.

Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant & Advertising & Other:

Revenue *(In millions)*

||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845|
|Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329|
|Advertising & Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410|
|**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|

Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.

Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.

Operating Margins: 

|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|

\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.

***Advertising & Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***

Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue: 

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|

\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.

Room nights booked *(in mill):*

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|896|591|355|845|

\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.

# Competitors:

Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:

||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|
|Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%|
|Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|

**AirBnb:**

The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.

**Website Traffic:**

Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.

Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S

***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***

Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.

Expedia operating margins:

|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10.2%|3%|\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|

\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.

# Industry:

OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.

# Intrinsic Value Estimate:

Historical data *(in mill)*:

&#x200B;

||**2023 (estimate)**|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|

|**FCF**|$7,054|$5,913|$2,243|\-$456|$4,318|$4,882|$4,398|$3,694|
|**Percentage Change**|19.3%|163.6%|591%|\-110%|\-11.5%|11%|19%|33.45%|
|**ROIC**|53.47%|43%|12.3%|\-3.37%|29.61%|26.67%|23.9%|23.1%|

Growth rates:

|**Growth Rates**|**1-yr**|**3-yr**|**5-yr**|**7-yr**|**9-yr**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|25%|47%|8%|11%|12%|
|FCF|19%|N/A (COVID)|8%|10%|11%|

I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

Margin of Safety Price ranges *(Discount to Intrinsic Value):*

|10%|$3,867|
|:-|:-|
|20%|$3,437|
|30%|$3,007|
|40%|$2,578|
|50%|$2,148|

&#x200B;

# Risk:

* Interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years.
* COVID really impacted the OTA industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur

\*\*\* I did not invest in this company, I just wanted to share my thoughts.
