1b1lcxt,investing,Warren Buffett is not fond of how the markets have started to resemble a casino,"“For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young,” he wrote in his annual shareholder letter.

The reality is that the stock market has always been and remains a money game.

Even if someone considers themselves an investor who, before buying a stock (and holding it for years), thoroughly examines the company's business, management quality, macroeconomic environment, and all that, they are still placing a bet.

A bet that the published results are accurate, unambiguous, and won't drastically change in the future, that the quality and motivation of the management will remain unchanged over a year, two, or five, etc.

Purchasing growth stocks is, by nature, a gamble.

Buffett's advice to speculators is undoubtedly wise: Remember who is really making money from your gambling—the House.

However, the simplicity and accessibility of market operations, which dismay the Maestro, have radically cheapened them. In his younger days, commissions were so high it's debatable when the House earned more, especially in relative terms.

Regarding potential risks, such as the rapid spread of panic sentiments, nothing akin to Black Monday has come close in the digital age.",2024-02-27 20:00:07,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763217,1 days 00:00:10.763218,181,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b1lcxt/warren_buffett_is_not_fond_of_how_the_markets/

1b1go5k,investing,Reddit files their S1 and is set for IPO,"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…

\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”

\- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe). 

I think there is a lot to be excited about, but also a lot of unknowns as Reddit moves to this next growth chapter.",2024-02-27 16:53:01,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763273,1 days 03:07:16.763273,106,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b1go5k/reddit_files_their_s1_and_is_set_for_ipo/

1b2931z,investing,Taking profits and re-investing inside tax advantage accounts when the funds go low again?,"This falls inside 'time the market' I am sure but really just looking for advice. 

This also falls into the crypto landscape as I invested 2 years ago into GBTC (inside Fidelity) and was long on BTC anyways...so when the news came out about the ETFs, I felt optimistic. It paid off...and the ETFs were approved.  I ended up selling at a small 'loss' the GBTC inside my ROTH IRA because I wanted to jump into FBTC (fidelity's version) due to low fees (0 until August, then 0.25% after) vs GBTC at 1.5%.   

So I got into GBTC at a basis of around $47...and got out around $42 I think, probably a 'loss' of about $2500. Because these ETFs are btc index funds, it's still all relative of value.  I then took the sold amount and put it into FBTC at a basis of $36. It's currently $53, so I am up about $5k since mid January. 

This also goes for ARKB (+$500) and MSTR (+$630).  Now, I am long on BTC...so with THAT being my mindset...am I better off just letting things be, even if there is a predicted correction that I feel confident is coming before the April halving (which is expected to cause the price to go up quite a bit)...or is this a scenario since I'm in a tax advantaged account that I should go ahead and grab my small profit and dump it back in when the correction happens? Of course...maybe that doesn't happen...and this just goes up and up (I just find that unlikely short term).",2024-02-28 15:44:13,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763298,0 days 04:16:04.763299,2,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b2931z/taking_profits_and_reinvesting_inside_tax/

1b18zxx,investing,"Citi's research, outlining their view that S&P 500 is not in a bubble.","Overall, the year-to-date surge of nearly 7% in the S&P 500 increases the necessity for fundamental growth factors to materialize and sustain the market's movement, Citi added. Essentially, investors are advancing funds based on anticipated future earnings growth. We remain confident in this, but need to recognize that much has quickly been priced in. While the index may overshoot our year-end 5100 target in the short term, it seems premature to increase the probability of our 5700 bull case scenario, strategists led by Scott T. Chronert said.

  
That scenario reflects a goldilocks macro and 22x a $260 index earnings projection (vs our base case $245 estimate). For now, we remain constructive on SP 500 fundamentals, but prefer to buy pullbacks, they added. Citi also responded to recent parallels drawn between the current bull market and the tech bubble, pointing out that today's valuation multiples are significantly lower than those seen in 1999-2000.

  
From their perspective, the strategists think that the underlying fundamentals of the market have markedly changed, distinguishing the current situation from that of the late '90s. That said, the current spending ramp on gen AI infrastructure and product will need to translate to incremental revenue and growth drivers. But it is premature to judge that, Chronert and his team commented.

  
Moreover, Citi previously said that market broadening is crucial for reaching new index peaks. While it's true that a handful of mega-cap companies have significantly propelled the S&P 500 to new highs, contributing to about half of the index's gains, there's also been a significant rise in the number of stocks reaching 52-week highs, Citi highlighted.",2024-02-27 10:47:51,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763339,1 days 09:12:26.763339,61,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b18zxx/citis_research_outlining_their_view_that_sp_500/

I know most of them sell some annually just for cash and whatnot but it does not seem like the norm that is happening right now. I can not find out if or what they are buying into. I also saw Soros and Buffet sold all of their bank stocks completely. I think that might be due to the gov. ending funding on March 11th for the banks but I am not sure.

Some of this info may be outdated but the articles I read were between Oct. 23- Feb. 18th 24. So if I am misunderstanding something please let me know.

TLDR: If the billionaires sold so much then what are they buying?

Edit: Some of you seem confused about the post. As you can see I mention some people that are not known for their stock portfolios. I was not asking this question so I could go spend my small amount on whatever they are ""investing"" into. I was looking for interesting things that I did not see or understand. For example, the Zuckergburg farm and all the conspiracy around it have been hilarious and very enjoyable reads. Also learning about some of the technical ways Buffet moves money that I did not know about has also been interesting.

Basically, I am just asking so I can learn and have something enjoyable to read on subjects I don't fully understand. I am clearly not some financial guru. Just someone wanting a discussion on this topic of where all this cash is going. No reason to get all hot and bothered and belittle others on here who want to share their unique ideas or things they have read.

The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.) That‘s a lot of exposure to tech.

*And because you have helped make Reddit what it is today, you now have the opportunity to become Reddit owners at the same price as institutional investors.*

*We’re offering a Directed Share Program (“DSP”) that invites eligible users and moderators who have contributed to Reddit to participate in our initial public offering (“IPO”). (Including you!)*

*Program Requirements
While being selected to pre-register is the first step, there are certain legal and regulatory requirements to participate in the DSP that are outside of Reddit’s control. Bear with us here…*

*To be eligible for the DSP, you must:

Be at least 18 years old;
Provide your full legal name and an email address;
Not be a current or former Reddit employee (FTE).
When the DSP launches (a few weeks after pre-registration ends), individuals who have been confirmed for the program will be contacted by our external DSP Administrator.

1b13gw3,investing,"34 yo, 1k per month into Wealthfront automated investment account","Hey all,

&#x200B;

I'm relatively new to financial diversification and despite the loads of time I've poured into educating myself, I still feel a little lost. For initial context, I'm 34, I make around $85k/year (not salaried).

&#x200B;

About six months ago I opened an automated investment account with Wealthfront. My risk tolerance is set at an 8.0 out of 10. On the first of every month, $1k is deposited into the account from my checking account. To date I've put $12k into the account. My portfolio breaks down as follows:

&#x200B;

**45% US Stocks (VTI & ITOT)**

&#x200B;

**15% Municipal Bonds (VTEB & MUB)**

&#x200B;

**15% Emerging Market Stocks (VWO & IEMG)**

&#x200B;

**15% Foreign Developed Stocks (SCHF)**

&#x200B;

**9% Dividend Growth Stocks (VIG)**

&#x200B;

At the moment, my only goal was to get my feet wet and have my money do something for me passively. I also have a HYSA with a couple years' worth of living expenses sitting in it at 4.35% APY. I'm not really looking to become a day trader, but does this breakdown seem like the best use of my money at this point in time? How else can I be educating myself, and in what other areas can I put effort to maximize my returns?

1b0qttn,investing,Backtesting 25 years of leveraged ETFs with Moving Averages,"[Screenshot of results](https://i.imgur.com/3Vxh7XD.png)

Hi, I want to share how anyone can easily backtest LETFs up to 1999 on PortfolioVisualizer. The reason is I haven't seen this method posted anywhere, my assumption is most are unaware of other tickers besides the classic UPRO or TQQQ.

Normally, the standard way is to create your own sim data which you import to PV. Pros: you can go back a lot further. Cons: prone to error if lacking knowledge, it requires a subscription plan, unable to publicly share their PV link (as we will do below).

The inception dates for the most popular LETFs are \~2010 for 3x (UPRO, TQQQ) and 2006 for 2x (SSO, QLD). We can accurately ""extend"" them by using these funds with inception date 1999:

* **ULPIX: 2x S&P 500**
* **UOPIX: 2x Nasdaq-100**

Then to simulate their 3x counterpart we apply 1.5x Leverage on them. We can check for consistency comparing them to UPRO and TQQQ, metrics should be close to identical:

* [UPRO vs 1.5x ULPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=e9Ww2XytVpITO3aDg6Q22)
* [TQQQ vs 1.5x UOPIX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=2tyAOeTrDXjMNI59YEVWg9)

Now all the PV links for the data I extracted in the screenshot (Buy & Hold vs MA):

* [S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6hdJviUxLkTKjsjY0X59gR)
* [2x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=1VzljcRe9xxCBcrh7VFhVQ)
* [3x S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=5rGWFUe9SGd5gN2Huz2PN6)
* [Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=6I1EZMO0waRp5YOCtxKeDr)
* [2x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=7GsHtE6iQHRfXS97sOxCeR)
* [3x Nasdaq-100](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/tactical-asset-allocation-model?s=y&sl=OGx3xyCH9eMOMtFWSvNyI)

My belief is 1999 is actually a great time to start backtesting LETFs as a minimum timeframe since we capture the 3 highest stress periods in the modern era (dotcom, subprime, pandemic) and as shown this can be easily achieved on PV by everyone.

Also 1999 proved quite terrible timing to lump sum into a LETF but I think this adds value to the analysis, as it emphasizes the catastrophic effect of drawdowns and hopefully tames the euphoria usually carried around LETF gains. They absolutely require a hedge to strive in the long-run regardless if lumpsum or DCA.

Which brings me to the last point - a way to mitigate this is by trading around a long Moving Average, which is why I included the strategy in the analysis. Not much to say here, this topic is already thoroughly discussed and backtested, worth checking:

* [Trend Following In Financial Markets](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/01/movingaverage/)
* [Leveraged SMA200 Strategy Back-tested 1929-2019](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=297591)
* [Leverage for the Long Run](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)
* [Using S&P 200-day moving average as volatility forecaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LETFs/comments/mfugvt/trading_letfs_upro_tqqq_etc_using_sp_200day/)

Only a few comments from my side regarding MA:

* Use the S&P 500 as signal even if you trade leveraged Nasdaq-100, the former is broader and a better market volatility indicator. Never trade based on the LETF crossovers, that is a costly mistake.
* Always trade at signal. Some use monthly due to superior results in certain backtests but those rely on timing luck, e.g. for the Covid crash you just so happened to go under the MA in the last days of February exactly when making the monthly trade, had this occurred a couple of days later March would have crushed your leveraged portfolio until your next monthly trade (>50% loss in UPRO)
* Most of the MA trades are unprofitable short-term whipsaws, this can be painful but normal and expected. It's the cost needed to make the strategy perform, a minority of highly profitable trades entirely make up for it and place you well ahead of a Buy & Hold on all risk metrics.
* You will notice I used the 12-months SMA (252 days). Also discussed in the above links, S&P 500 backtests since 1929 show nearly identical results on all metrics between 200<->250 SMA, so just use \~250 because this improves on the number of signals and whipsaws. For example in the period I backtested above there are 143 trades, if we change the Lookback Period to 9 months (189 days) we get 201 trades, an unnecessary 40% increase (this can be checked under ""Model Trades"" in my PV links)
* I also wrote a simple TradingView script to illustrate every 250-day signal, just add it on your SPX chart: [tradingview.com/script/lwFiJxKB](https://www.tradingview.com/script/lwFiJxKB-Moving-Average-250-day-Strategy/)

1b1mpq5,investing,Stock Market Hasn’t Been This Hot in Decades. Is the Rally Justified?,"This is mostly a straight copy paste from a Barron’s article. I’ve been reading a lot more noise from the financial press about overheated values. So I tend to peruse the articles that give multiple sides or data supporting their claims.

There are lots of Nvidia mentions, of course. But pretty much any pan market analysis is going to mention Nvidia.

From Barron’s:

https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-hottest-decades-1ca7bcf5

> The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary few months, any way you slice it. The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.”

> The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971.

> Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble

> Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect

> And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.”

> Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [**really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm**]

The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots.

But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical.

Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it.

Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now.

But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.

1b0vwaa,investing,US treasury note: long term capital gains?,"EDIT: solved. Accrued market discount is specified on box 1f, which brings an adjustment negating all capital gains, and requires reporting the gains as interest on Schedule B. (see Worksheet for Accrued Market Discount Adjustment in Column in Form 8949 instructions)

&#x200B;

Fidelity sent me this 1099-B for a treasury note I bought on the secondary market, and held for just over a year until maturity:

See the 1099: [https://imgur.com/a/exUWih3](https://imgur.com/a/exUWih3)

Here's a [link](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2016/A_20160922_2.pdf) to the original treasury announcement for this note (but again: I bought it on the secondary market, in 2022).

I'm surprised to see it categorized as long term capital gains on the 1099 - I expected interest income. I don't think the de minimis rule applies here given the discount amount, so I don't understand the reason.

To be clear this is good news for me I'm in the top tax bracket, so without taking NIIT into account I get 20% LTCG taxation instead of 37% (no state taxes). So I'm not complaining, but it seems I don't actually understand how it works.

Fidelity says (in the ""Features & Benefits"" tab): [https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds](https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/individual-bonds/us-treasury-bonds)

>When a bond is purchased at market discount and held until maturity, the market discount is treated as interest income.

This is exactly my case, except on the 1099-B we can see the market discount categorized as capital gain. So this doesn't make sense to me to all.

2 questions:

If you do just small trades, you can generally profit every single time - but that time you wager a bit more than you really should, that's when it bites you in the butt. 

&#x200B;

Take for example today with NVDA - on the market open I made several short sale trades with say 2 to 5 shares. No problem. Price kept dropping. Profit. Was up about $75 to $100 about 15 minutes / 6 trades in - all profiting trades. Then I decided hell, why not try shorting 33 shares. OOF - price rose $6 in 3 minutes and I had to cover to prevent further losses. Blew through all the profits I made and then some. 

&#x200B;

It's seriously as if market makers see people who are getting greedy and purposely price them out of the market, like the whole thing is a freaking game.

1azwatd,investing,Forecast Change: The S&P 500 will rally higher than expected,"  
Goldman Sachs Research raised its target for the S&P 500 Index for year-end 2024 from 5,100 to 5,200, representing a gain of 4% from the index's level on February 16. The higher forecast reflects Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin's expectations for stronger economic growth and higher profits from the information technology and communication services sector. This sector is home to five of the Magnificent Seven stocks — the tech companies accounting for about a third of the S&P 500's market capitalization. Our analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings per share of $241 in 2024 and $256 in 2025, up from $237 and $250 previously.  
  
The Magnificent Seven is estimated to have lifted margins in the fourth quarter by 582 basis points (year over year), leading to earnings growth of 58%. By contrast, margins for the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 contracted by 56 basis points and earnings fell by 2% (the declines being driven primarily by energy stocks).",2024-02-25 19:20:43,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763619,3 days 00:39:34.763619,82,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azwatd/forecast_change_the_sp_500_will_rally_higher_than/
1b082kc,investing,What is the point of bonds when you can use CDs?,"I always hear people throw out the idea of a 60/40 portfolio especially as you get older near 45 or 50 & up, but I never understood what the exact point of this is. Bonds behave similar to stocks, when a stock market crash happens like 2022, 2020, 2008 - bonds can get hit just as hard as stocks. Well maybe not quite as hard, but you still lose money if you have 40% of your portfolio in bonds or even if you had 100% of your portfolio in bonds. 

&#x200B;

And for that case most dividend stocks would take a hit too unless it's something that's not directly invested in stocks like JEPI or other derivative based products. Bitcoin got hit pretty hard in the 2020 and 2022 crashes as well, so crypto isn't safe. 

&#x200B;

But CDs - Certificates of Deposts. They are FDIC insured to 250k per account, and if you use Fidelity they can be deposit swept up to 1 million in FDIC insurance. They yield 5.0% to 5.7%, which is better than most bond portfolios over time have yielded, and just 1% off the average return of my wife's Edward Jones portfolio and 2-3% off the average return of the S&P 500. 

&#x200B;

And Certificates of Deposit have ZERO RISK OF DIPPING IN VALUE! Your funds can be locked up, but if this is a retirement strategy, that's actually what you want - you won't be touching it until you retire anyways.

&#x200B;

So are bonds useless if you can put CDs in your Roth IRA? There is no tax advantage what so ever to anything in a Roth as it's all taxed already. If you're in a Traditional IRA, dividends and yield basically are taxed as income anyway so no real advantage either way. So I just don't get why people use bonds if they have the option to balance their portfolio at all.",2024-02-26 03:52:46,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763623,2 days 16:07:31.763623,92,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b082kc/what_is_the_point_of_bonds_when_you_can_use_cds/

1b0mfd0,investing,Compounding Interest Difference Eventually Stuck At Specific Percent Difference,"Apologies ahead of time as I am not sure if my wording is sufficient and I am also not someone with a finance or math background professionally. I do enjoy investing on the side and like learning about personal finance in general. I found myself trying to compare something someone posted about on IG asking people if they'd prefer getting $6k a week for life or $5 million right now. 

At a certain point of comparison, I tried comparing them to see how it would look if you invested both incomes at 10% YoY with no taxable income/dividends to control for. Strictly just 10% YoY value growth. 

So using [this calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.htm), I tried to see how each one would look with this return over the course of various time periods (12.5 years, 25, 50, etc.). I figured at SOME point the $6k a week income would eventually start to return more than the initial one, (even if like hundreds of years into the future haha), because of a combination of compounding and consistent, continuous investments as opposed to a one time lump sum investment. 

So after 12.5 years, the difference between the two scenarios was like 72%. 

At 25 years it was around 32.5%.

At 50 years it was around 21.25%.

I seem to have encountered a conundrum where at around 70 years, the % difference between the first and second scenario becomes about 20.2% and then as I increment the time periods it seems to stay constant. I've tried up to 400 years and it's sitting at 20.2%.

I think my math for calculating the % difference is correct.

(Scenario A - Scenario B) / Scenario B

Is it maybe some limitation with the calculator I am using? If not, what is this phenomenon called? Why is 20.2% the final coefficient (if that's the right terminology). This also leads me to believe in some combination where the two types of contribution types will eventually meet in the middle and then rise evenly from then on?  

Again, apologies if this is something obvious to investment/math professionals that I am unaware of but I couldn't find out too much online or with ChatGPT (could also have to do with my wording) and I am just trying to learn more.",2024-02-26 16:58:01,2024-02-28 20:00:17.763705,2 days 03:02:16.763705,5,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b0mfd0/compounding_interest_difference_eventually_stuck/

1b0lmgn,investing,How do I contribute to a roth ira ?,"Over the past few years, I've dabbled in meme stocks, but in 2024, I decided to give one particular stock a final shot with the $10,000 I had. Despite reassurances from many friends that Rivian was the future, I bought in at $21. However, I never anticipated losing 50 percent of my investment so rapidly. I had set up a stop-loss order to trigger if the stock lost 50 percent of its value. It's important to note that this investment was intended for the long term, spanning five years, yet half of it vanished within a month. I'm kicking myself because I could have simply put that money into an IRA account. Now, with the remaining $5,000 returning to the bank, I'm calling it quits on both stocks and sports gambling. I'll opt for the easier route and invest in index funds.

So, how does a Roth IRA work? I understand it doesn't offer tax deductions like a traditional IRA, but it provides tax-free growth. Since my workplace only provides a 401k, I'm curious about the process of contributing to a Roth IRA quickly. I already have a Fidelity account, but I'm hesitant to look at it because back in 2021, I lost the $50,000 I had in there due to unrealized gains from meme stocks. It's emotionally taxing to revisit it and dwell on the past. Is there an alternative method for opening a Roth IRA?

1az8jex,investing,What are ways you have invested in your home that have yielded the highest annual ROI?,"Here are the big ones for me:

* Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high.
* Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more.
* All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights.
* Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.

The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.

I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.

1azsb38,investing,How can I benefit from the rapid growth and new developments in our area? ,"Part of an area I live in was once considered less desirable, but over the last 10 to 15 years, it's really started to come alive. We've seen a wave of new developments like apartments and small business buildings offering space for dental clinics, gyms, food parks, and more. This has opened up services that weren't available here before.

Many customers of the said businesses are students from a nearby private school, who tend to be from wealthier families, and employees from a small corporate office. With more apartments being built, I anticipate an increase in potential customers.

I expect these developments to continue in maybe for the next 10+ years and fortunately my house is just around of all these developments, which has me thinking about how I can make the most of these opportunities. I'm in my early 20s and planning for my future, so I'm not in a rush but thinking about possibilities for the next five years or so.

One idea I had was to open a pet supplies store, as there isn't one nearby yet. The number of pet owners are still growing, especially with more couples choosing not to have children.

Market and Location: How do local conditions sway your choice between residential and commercial real estate? What location characteristics are key for success?

1azt786,investing,Number of customers versus number of accounts at big investment firms ... overstated?,"I'm not sure if this is on topic for this /sr but I wonder if anyone can help,

I'm interested in how many customers or households have accounts at the big U.S. investment firms (like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard).

Folks in this /sr are obviously attuned to investing. But when you consider the entirety of the U.S. population - all the grandmas and folks living paycheck to paycheck and folks new to the U.S. and the fraction of households where concepts like index funds and investing just never were any part of family conversation - I think that a good fraction of the U.S. simply doesn't think of or do any investing. (At least not directly; their employer may sock away money in a 401k for them, but they don't actively manage it or have a personal account where they do their own investing.)

In particular, I'd venture that **less than half of U.S. households have a personal investment account** where they can (and do) buy/sell stocks, index funds, ETFs, etc. (Separate from, e.g., a 401(k) their employers might have made for them ... I mean an account they personally actively made and trade with.)

Where am I going with all this? Let's look at some numbers:

* [The FDIC says](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/index.html) there are \~108 M ""fully banked"" households in the U.S.
* [This recent Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/vanguard-vs-fidelity-4587961) says Vanguard has over 30 M and Fidelity over 43 M ""individual investors""
* [This recent Schwab press release](https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2023/Schwab-Reports-Monthly-Activity-Highlights-db1d3b14b/default.aspx) says it has 34 M active brokerage accounts

That's a total of 107 M investment investors and/or accounts (Vanguard 30 + Fidelity 43 + Schwab 34)

Whereas the U.S. has, at most, \~108 M households with bank accounts.

And this 107 only counts three big investment firms when there are [many others](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/largest-stock-brokerage-firms/).

There's just no way that every household in the U.S. that has any bank account, also has a separate investing account they're active in (past their employer's retirement account).

So what exactly is being counted here?

I don't doubt that the counts above (30 to 40 M per firm) are accurate somehow. But ... *how*?

Could this explain it: I personally have a lot going on with a big investing firm. I have a taxable (joint with wife), a Roth IRA, and a Traditional IRA. Also my parents passed, leaving an Inherited set of the same (that's six accounts so far). Then my wife also has her own separate taxable, Roth, and Trad. IRA with that same firm.

So we are one household... but it would also be accurate to say we have nine accounts. (But note that the Investopedia article specifically says *individual investors*, not *accounts.)*

So I guess the bottom line I'm driving at here is: What **percent of households have at least one investment account**, and a direct account at that? (One they actively established and use, separate from any employer retirement accounts)

Where can one find numbers like that, and what would they be called?

But more importantly, is there a way to see this particular number for the big investment firms? (customers or households, NOT ""accounts"")

Something's not right when there's a clear impression that firms' numbers add up to way more investors in the U.S. than even have bank accounts!

I hope this is making sense. Thank you for bearing with me! I appreciate it if you can shed any light on these huge numbers.

**EDIT** a couple of hours after the above OP:

Thanks to you folks responding, I see I need to look deeper. I came across [this FINRA National Financial Capability Study](https://www.finrafoundation.org/knowledge-we-gain-share/nfcs/data-and-downloads)'s 2021 Investor Survey Report, which says (p. 3): ""In 2021, just over a third (**35 percent**) of the national population had investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other securities outside of retirement accounts. There has been a slight upward trend in the percentage of investors since 2015.""

This sounds close to how I would define people or household counts with ""active investing not including employer retirement plans"". IOW, how many *people* are in fact active investors.

But it still doesn't answer the question of how I might find similar numbers for big investment firms. they may well keep this a close-guarded secret.",2024-02-25 17:17:51,2024-02-28 20:00:19.478751,3 days 02:42:28.478752,5,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1azt786/number_of_customers_versus_number_of_accounts_at/

I was thinking about going a 70/30 route, but instead of making it about Wolrd/EM, making it All-World/factors. One possiblity would be to add different world factor ETFs. Say an MSCI World value, quality, small cap and momentum ETF in a, say, 10/10/5/5 ratio. Another possiblity I thought about is using an equal weighted world ETF. The equal weighted S&P 500 has historically (going back decades, not just the recent past) outperformed the market weighted ETF, so using an equal weighted world ETF seems to make sense instead of the VWCE world. Here a ratio of 70/30 with factors seems reasonable to me as well. Does anyone here run a similar equity portfolio to this? I ran it through Morningstars x-ray and it looked promising.

1aztgxv,investing,Need advice on my planned strategy.,"I have a lump sum for me to invest into growth products. However, I am quite conservative in investing, and my risk tolerance is low to moderate so I will just do normal etfs and bonds instead of leverage, options or forex, so that I can sleep well during the night. I have made two simple plans that I hope experienced people who have been through high and low in the market can share their thoughts of and give me logical and practical advice, including why they are good or bad plans.

Here is my first plan:

All in TLT. And when the government is going to drop the interest rate, the price will go up, then I will sell it to get capital gain between 15% to 40% based on the historical data, and if the unlikely recession will ever happens, the gain can be even more.

After that, if the market is still hot and unpredictable, I will do fractional share reinvestment with DCA:

25% SCHG
20% Nvdia (stock) or SMH
20% XLK
20% VT
15% Inda

Then in the future, when the stock market is will drop, I will invest the lump sum into them with the same percentage. And maybe one day, when technology is not the driver of the stock market anymore, I can replace technology ETFs with a new sector.

The second plan is to start DCA now, so I don’t waste time while waiting for that capital gain of TLT.

1azruol,investing,Leveraging Real Estate to reduce Sequence of Return Risk.,"My Portfolio is 95% FNILX and I'd like to keep it that way more or less well into retirement.

I plan to retire with about 2 Million dollars in my portfolio.

I'm not so well-off that I don't have sequence risk though, especially if we're talking about the 1st couple years after retirement, or the year before retirement. My expected withdrawal rate in the first 5 years of retirement is 5 or 5.5%, at which point I reach social security age and withdrawal rate drops down to 3 to 4%.

I'm planning to use the roughly 600k in Home equity I have to bridge this risk. By either refinancing the home, pulling a heloc, a sale, or a number of other ways based on what is most appropriate at that time. If the market takes a big enough crap in this very key year-range.

What I'm curious is... I've seen some numbers tossed around like.. 'the market has a XX% dip every XX many years' and 'the market tends to rebound within xx timeframe' . I am curious if a table or mathematical formula for ... let's say 'buying the dip' exists in relation to sequence risk in retirement.

Example: "" If the market goes down 10%, I will...    "" vs. 15% or 20%, etc etc.

My thought process had been, a 10% hit to the market and I might utilize a Heloc for a years worth of spending, if the market takes a 20% hit I might refinance the home, take 18 months of living expenses as cash, and add the rest of my equity to the portfolio to buy the dip. But these are just vague, feelings-based numbers I pulled off the top of my head.

I am wondering if anyone or any webpage has mathed this out extensively because I would be very interested in seeing that data and where my real numbers should be for these decisions. It would kind of be similar to the probabilities involved in 'buying the dip' so if you have some great math on that topic you think would be helpful I would be interested in reading that as well.

1azdmrw,investing,I Bonds as the best safe asset for tax purposes?,"While most of my portfolio is in VT, having some portion in a safe inflation protected asset is appealing. I'm thinking I Bonds might be the best way to go (simply buy the max every year, forever).  
  
My understanding is that in general people are lukewarm on I Bonds because TIPS or HYSA or money market funds can provide higher returns and be more flexible. However, I'm not so sure this is true for my circumstance for a few reasons.  
  
(1) I Bonds are state/local tax free. I have an over 10% state + local tax rate now, so this is meaningful. Some other assets also have this property, but I don't right now know of any others which also have....  
  
(2) You can defer paying tax until redeeming. Right now my marginal tax rate is near 50%. So I make 5% on a HYSA and lose half of it. But in theory if I just hold the I Bonds until retirement (where my income will certainly be way way lower) then I will pay significantly less tax on the interest then I would along the way via HYSA/tips/money market etc.  
  
So my questions are: Does anything else also have the combo property of (1) and (2)? Or even just (2)...  
  
And is this actually likely to be worth the difference in returns compared to other safe options? Understood if it's sort of impossible to know but would appreciate some input.

1ayr42z,investing,Nvidia's AI moat is both more and less than you might think,"Nvidia seems to be a really hot topic here with the recent AI craze so I figured I should chime in some thoughts I don't see mentioned enough or at all. *This will get a tiny bit technical.*

Nvidia's current dominance in both gaming performance and deep learning performance is undisputed. What people often overlook though is that Nvidia's cards can also be used for accelerating (among others) 1) rendering workloads (e.g. animations and effects for commercials or movies), 2) physics simulations, 3) video transcoding (maybe video content platforms?), and 4) non-deep-learning-based machine learning.

## Nvidia's moat is less than you might think

For **inference** and specifically **edge** workloads, Nvidia's moat is tiny to non-existent.

Nvidia faces competition from Google (TPUs), Intel / Apple / Snapdragon / others (AI on CPUs and SBCs), Intel / AMD (GPUs), Intel / Google / others (accelerators / compute sticks), and everyone who has any sort of custom chip. 

Various ML/AI models running on flagship phones, VR headsets, internet browsers, SBCs, and even gaming PCs (e.g. upscalers) have been running on ARM, Intel, and AMD chips for nearly a decade. Even LLMs have been receiving some love and work on getting them running on CPUs and AMD GPUs, with the smaller models (1-7B, especially aggressively-quantized ones) running somewhat decently on just CPU+RAM (e.g. 1-2 words / second on a RaspberryPi 5). 

> But is this representative of the industry? 

Well, kinda. Edge inferencing (smartphone, VR, SBCs, browser, ...) is growing and will probably continue to grow quickly. Small LLMs are also **very** relevant to large tech companies (my current employer primarily uses 7-70B models for most products, plus OpenAI / Microsoft / AWS / Anthropic integrations) for both fine-tuning and inferencing. My wider department has 10+ projects working on such LLMs and services around them. AMD GPUs for inferencing are also gaining steam with projects like vLLM adding support (Jan 2024) for ROCm.

> Wait a moment, you mentioned fine-tuning. You don't do that on a CPU or AMD GPU, right?

Correct, which brings us to...

## Nvidia's moat is more than you might think

While inferencing can happen (and does happen) anywhere (e.g. we're using non-GPU instances for quite a few workloads), **training** and **fine-tuning** *only ever happens on Nvidia GPUs*. There a few reasons for that.

First, training and fine-tuning are way more intensive (and thus require more acceleration) than other workloads, so fully leveraging Nvidia's acceleration capabilities is critical. It's not just CUDA and deep learning frameworks (pytorch, tensorflow, ...). There are over 20 really popular projects that are directly based on Nvidia GPUs (e.g. TensorRT-LLM, cuFFT, cuBLAS, cudf, nvvl, ...) or only come with CUDA-support out of the box (e.g. RAPIDS, XGBoost). 

Even if/when other GPUs/accelerators fully catch up (which will take a while even when pooling AMD and community contributions), that would still not be enough. Training & fine-tuning on just one GPU is not very common anymore. Even for a smaller non-LLM model I trained early last year, I had to use 4-8 GPUs for a reasonable training completion time. For LLMs, it's even worse; you often need multiple GPUs on multiple servers and pooling them is no easy task. *And even if you implement the pooling of those GPUs in software (e.g. AMD contributes to pytorch/tensorflow), then you would still lag behind Nvidia*, simply because they have also done work for that on the hardware side (e.g. NVLink/NVSwitch, DGX/OVX systems).

Finally, inferencing. I touched on this in the previous section and mentioned that Nvidia might not be a monopoly, but that was only partially true. While inferencing with decent quality and latency can and does happen on other devices, inferencing at scale massively benefits from being done on a single place (e.g. on some cloud with Nvidia GPUs) both from a cost standpoint (resource management & economies of scale) and a latency one. Both AMD and Intel have tons of data center experience, but they just aren't there yet, and these take years to develop.

## Conclusion

Will edge inferencing eat away at Nvidia's earnings? Nah, these were mostly separated from the beginning, and disproportionate increases of edge over cloud computing are not something I'd bet on. Will people keep buying Nvidia GPUs like they do now? No idea, but large data centers (e.g. AWS, Azure, Meta) will re-cycle their GPUs every a few years to get the newest (and supported) stuff, and by the time the next cycle comes, I think the overwhelming majority of sales will still end up Nvidia's way. 2-3 cycles later? No idea, but Nvidia's sales still won't be low because supporting legacy systems is an almost-necessary thing. Is the valuation of today pricing all these in? No idea. Is AI a bubble? Nope, LLMs and prompting may or may not be, but AI (or ML) doesn't end there. The hype around AI may subside, as it has done 3-5 times in the past, but we still haven't fully exported the possibilities of the the current wave so let's not kill it too early.

1azcfte,investing,Roll overs and self management,"Okay there's a few different things in here so I'll try my best to lay it all out.

Current situation:

\- 5% of my income goes in a trad 401k for the company match

\-  I use a trad IRA to backdoor in a Roth IRA every year

\- I invest some extra in a taxable account

&#x200B;

First question is that I want to roll over my 401k every 2 months and self manage in my trad IRA. I do not plan to backdoor these contributions because it's going to increase my tax burden and I'd rather defer some taxation for now. By doing this, does it impact my annual contribution to the trad IRA that I then roll over to a Roth? I'm not sure how the pro rata rule factors in here if at all.

My second question, is I have the option to also participate in a Roth 401k. For this scenario I'm assuming my entire match is for the trad contribution, so I could just roll over some extra capital into my Roth IRA every month. However if I decide I want the Roth contributions matched and I roll over, what tax consequences could I be looking at? If I ever wanted to withdraw the 'contributions' from the Roth IRA are matches considered gains or contributions?

Basically I want to self manage my 401k by rolling it into my IRAs and want to figure out the most efficient and least tax consequential method of doing so. I want to add a Roth 401k contribution to roll over and not sure which one to add the company match on.

Outside of IPOs and secondary offerings, any money I use to purchase equities, the company doesn’t see it. “Not investing in unethical companies” doesn’t seem to solve anything since your investment doesn’t go to the company but rather the trader you’re exchanging with.  

Why should I care if my money goes to Nestle stock when Nestle doesn’t see that money?  On the surface, ESG investing seems to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. The best I can think of is that, in general, buying and thus helping increase market capitalization values executive pay higher and higher valuations for potential future secondary offerings or acquisitions/future buyout/loan possibilities.  However, this doesn’t deter me as it doesn’t seem ESG investing meaningfully impacts this reality. I’m sure there are facets of this I’m missing, so I’m excited to hear others thoughts on this.

1aznz5f,investing,"Has Anyone Successfully Managed a DIY Systematic, Non-Emotional Investing Strategy? ","
I'm venturing into the realm of systematic investing and am intrigued by the concept of factor-based portfolios. The idea of removing emotion from investing and relying on a predefined system or equation to guide stock selection and allocation decisions seems both challenging and rewarding.

I'm curious to learn from those who have walked this path:

1. Success Stories: Have you created and successfully managed a factor-based portfolio? I'd love to hear about your strategy, the factors you prioritize (e.g., value, momentum, quality, etc.), and how you've refined your approach over time.

2. Challenges:  Were there any unexpected hurdles in sticking to a systematic approach?

3. Tools and Platforms: This is a big one for me. Which trading platforms do you find most conducive to executing and managing a systematic portfolio? I’ve been using IKBR and I'm looking for platforms that offer flexibility, robust analytical tools, and perhaps automation capabilities to streamline the process.

4. Advice for Beginners: For someone just starting their journey in systematic, non-emotional investing, what advice would you give? Any resources, books, or courses that you found invaluable?

5. Portfolio Management: How do you manage portfolio rebalancing, risk management, and keep your strategy aligned with your investment goals?

 I'm here to learn from your journeys, insights, and perhaps even your mistakes.

Thank you in advance for sharing your wisdom

1az7xcd,investing,Early Retirement Advice Needed,"I'm 40 years old and I'm cautiously optimistic that I can retire early, like in 5 years. Or at least drastically cut hours working.

 I've been planning for it for a decade and have been investing heavily with this in mind, both in index funds and more risky individual stocks. (I'm ok with high risk, high reward as it gets me closer to this goal, and if it doesn't work, then i can always extend my timeline.)

I have two young children, which complicates it some. 

Here's where I'm looking for advice. 
Once investments have gotten to a comfortable number, like the 4% rule, or 25x yearly expenses, where's the best place to park all the capital?

Keep it in the same investments? Move to long term CDs? Bonds? A combination of it all? I've always been in the wealth accumulation phase, never in the preservation phase, so it is uncharted waters for me.

1az1tt0,investing,Looking for advice regarding 529 vs. investing for my son.,"So, I was going to open a 529 account for my 4yr old today, but then I thought back and recalled someone speaking about perhaps just strictly investing (S&P500 only perhaps?) for their kids and not using a 529. Perhaps I'm misremembering or misconstruing the original post I read though, but I believe it was basically stressing that kids would be better off with parents going the investing route.

My two stepsons both have Greenlight accounts and 529 accounts. Their mom makes occasional investments for them long-term through Greenlight on certain stocks, and they can use their Greenlight cards for purchasing things occasionally with approval. I'm trying to start a game plan for my 4 year old.

&#x200B;

* 529 route limits spending to educational purposes and living, correct?
   * Upside: Tax free for college spending.
   * Downside: Limited to college spending. Low interest rate.
* Investing (perhaps just S&P500?), would be more lucrative and perhaps pan out better? 
   * Upside: Earn more money off of the investments after taxes vs. tax free 529. Can spend anywhere as needed once cashed out.
   * Downside: Taxed whenever deciding to sell. Can lose money on investments if buying into the wrong choices or a market crash.

My portfolio:

50% - FXAIX (SP500 large cap Index) - exp ratio .015%

30% - FSSNX (Russell1000 small cap Index) - exp ratio .025%  >> moved balance and allocation to FSMDX 

20% - FSNAX (US Bond Index) -  exp ratio .025.%   

&#x200B;

My question is FSNAX bond index fund vs FID Money Market Fund (SPAXX).  SPAXX has exp ratio of .42%

  
When the stocks go down, my bond fund goes up.   Does the Money Market Fund do the same?   
Should i stick with 30% in bond index or maybe allocate something to the money market? 

Or ditch the bond index and send 30% to money market as true stable, extremely low risk ""savings"" account.  The returns for 10yr LOF are 1.06% for money market and 1.6% for bond index. 

Thanks for you time.

\*\*FSMDX index is offered and based Russell Mid Cap Index with similar exp ratio and i have put in the order to move balance and allocation from FSSNX to this index.

Plan offers other managed funds with exp ratios from .5%-.85% which is obvs much higher than index fund.   Some of them are outperforming the indexes but those expenses are much higher so ill stick with index funds.

If we’re in a bubble, as the AI doomsayers keep telling us, it’s a bubble that is pretty much encompassing the entire market. The headline of one article I’m quoting is: it’s not just AI.

So if you’re trying to be defensive, your only option seems to be to stock up on gold, oil, pitchforks, and shovels. Or buy a LOT of tinfoil to keep you and your family wrapped tight for…however long this lasts

> As the S&P 500 booked its best weekly advance since early January, one detail set this week apart: All 11 of the large-cap index’s sectors managed to finish in the green for the first time since November, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 managed to clinch its 13th record close of 2024

> “It’s like a rising tide lifts all boats. There is more participation in this advance. It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.”

> The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth. Three sectors hit new highs this past week—tech, healthcare, and industrials. Financials and materials are less than 5% away from their peaks. Costco Wholesale, which sells more corn chips than microchips, is at a record too.


**S&P 500 Sector	Gain during week ended Feb. 23**

* Consumer Staples	2.1%

* Information Technology	2%

* Materials	1.9%

* Industrials	1.8%

* Financials	1.6%

* Consumer Discretionary	1.54%

* Health Care	1.51%

* Communication Services	1.49%

* Utilities	1.2%

* Real Estate	0.9%

* Energy	0.4%

> Most of the market’s 25% gain since late October was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates starting in March—or May at the very latest. Recent comments from members of the Fed, along with signs of persistent inflation, suggest that the first cut could come in June or even later. Hopes for as many as seven rate cuts this year have faded away. **At some point, rate cuts will matter again.**

1ay852f,investing,Do all stocks go up because one stock goes up?,"NVDA is a $2 trillion company, which is the third largest American company. As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,

Because this leads to an unintuitive conclusion in my head: given two stocks A and B that have zero alpha and high beta in unrelated sectors.

1az86v6,investing,"IBKR offers good value, even in a scenario with lower interest rates","Interactive Brokers is a low-cost electronic brokerage. 74.6% of the company is held by its founder Thomas Jefferffy, leaving only about 25.4% of the company as free float in the market.  
  
The company went public in 2007 being mainly a market maker for options. As the market-making business declined, IBKR pivoted toward automatic electronic brokerage, selling the market-maker part of the business. Since then, the company has steadily increased users and equity from users.  
  
Given that they’re a low-cost provider of brokerage, highly focused on technology and automatization, their net margins are really high. That’s why, if they focus on growth, it will translate into the net margins straight away.  
  
  
  
Dividend? Buybacks? Nah  
  
  
  
The company has stated in its earnings call for Q4 2023 that increasing dividends or buying back shares are unlikely to happen. They are accumulating earnings to grow, most likely through an acquisition.  
  
The company is relentlessly focused on growth. As they don’t think that paying more dividends or buying back shares will increase the growth of the company in the long run, they will not do it. Instead, they’re scrutinizing the market to acquire a competitor. That would mean instant growth both in revenues and net margin. However, we’ve widely seen how acquisitions all over the world, and in all industries, usually destroy value. Of course, it all depends on the discipline and patience of the management team to not rush on a deal because they have the money in their hands.  
  
The future is uncertain, though. And although I’m sure that acquiring a competitor may excite the market, it may not be the best way to go. Anyway, they operate in a great industry, with good margins. So maybe declining interest rates give them an opportunity to acquire a good business at a good price.  
  
INTRINSIC VALUE OF IBKR  
  
There is a margin of safety if we estimate that the interest rates will go down to 2%. If interest rates stay higher for longer, the margin of safety is wide.  
  
Assuming the above, the normalized net profit for the company would be sitting at $1.812M. This would mean a total market value of $49.249M, or said otherwise, a 15.68% margin of safety compared to today’s price (February 16th, 2024). For this company, given its quality, growth, and earnings visibility, I have found fair a PE ratio of 27.18 times. The required margin of safety for this company would be 12.54%, which makes IBKR a buy today. Please refer to the PE calculation at the end of the document for further details.  
  
Note about the interest rates and the normalized net profit. The company stated in the Q4 2023 conference call that every 25 basis points decrease in the benchmark would result in a $56M reduction in net income. Thus, this would mean a reduction of $784M, in line with our normalized net profit.  
  
However, the company has stated that they will be pursuing an acquisition. I haven’t accounted for the excess cash as part of the base (normalized) valuation since the management is not giving it back to shareholders. But they will be pursuing an acquisition. Assuming that they won’t allocate all their excess cash to this acquisition (they have stated that they will pursue a payment based on cash and stocks), I think that a probable scenario would be a $7B acquisition. Assuming a poor return on the acquisition of 5% net profit, that would add $350M in net profits to the company. Assuming the same PE as before, the margin of safety would increase to 38.03%. All of this, assuming lower interest rates.  
  
I consider the current M.O.S. compelling enough to invest in the company. There’s plenty of upside while the downside of the investment looks reduced. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the share price won’t fall, especially if interest rates start declining, but it won’t be a decrease in value. Rather, it would represent an outstanding investment opportunity. However, the fact that the company is not willing to buy back shares or increase its dividend is also worth noting. I don’t think that the company will waste its money on acquisitions since the management has stated that they have refused two potential acquisitions due to price discrepancies. But if they do, we should revisit the assumptions made to give IBKR a PE ratio of 27 times.

* Directories. I’ve been pointed to “directories” but these all reek of marketing tools so I never know if I can trust them.

Quick example, say last year someone maxed their Roth IRA at $6,500. Bought whatever and had $200 leftover. 

This year say someone maxes out their Roth IRA at $7,000. Can they spend $7,200? Or does it have to be spent per year? 

I can see $7,200 triggering something negative since it’s over the $7,000 limit (if that’s someone’s max), or is it ok to spend the leftover $ from a previous year?

1azbrf7,investing,"I'm ready to make a prediction.
","The bubble will pop.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

This is a real ""set it and forget it"" kind of thing, basically just another nook I can stash funds over a couple of decades. I'm also open to the idea of using it as a college fund or another that would be great for a college fund. (Already have the 529 thing going)

Just wondering which companies might be good, easy to work with, reliable/other things I haven't considered.

1ay6u5t,investing,401k reallocation at market peaks,"Hello.

My 401k is underperforming the general market because of my current allocation:

43% large cap growth index
43% large cap value index
13% small cap index

Generally I'm looking to be 100% in index funds and match the annual performance of a major index like S&P or NASDAQ. 

So the 56% of my portfolio in value and small cap is dragging my overall performance as compared to S&P and NASDAQ.

I'm going to reallocate but since S&P and NASDAQ are at all time highs, I don't think it's a good time to move large chunks of money in.

I've changed my future contributions to buy 100% large cap growth. I'm comfortable with a DCA approach on my contributions.

I'm considering just holding my current assets until there is a dip in the large cap growth or a big spike in the value.

What's your approach with reallocation at our current ATHs? 

So

I have absolutely no knowledge of investing, so I would like to hear inputs from more qualified people.

For context: I work for a telecom company, and in the past they have not offered stock option for employees. now, suddenly the company announced that they would offer stock purchase for employees because apparently ""many people voiced their request, and we heard"".

Here's the thing: from what I observed, the stock option doesn't give employees any type of discount for the purchase. Also, instead of letting employees purchase directly, the company is offering it through their retirement funds.

I felt that there's something wrong and looked up the company's stock performance, and in the past 5 years, the company's stock values has doubled between 2020 and 2021, but from then on it dropped back down to half its values from peak.

1az0ad4,investing,Can we address the elephant in the room?? Or at least acknowledge that something is wrong?,"I go on various investment subreddits....and people act like these markets are healthy.

 We literally have the FED chairman whispering to the markets every couple of months,, teasing gently with rate cuts etc. 

How is it that one man wields so much control over markets that are supposed to be ""free"" and based on company performance?


All everyone ever says whether its in real life or reddit is the following ""invest in your 401k and VOO for 40 years and everything will be ok"".  

No one ever acknowledges the elephant in the room. That the markets are being propped up by stimulus, qe , unlimited debt, and the promise of rate cuts. If any of the above gets removed...401ks, housing equity,banks will drop like a rock overnight.  Its alll faith based.  Does that sound like a healthy market to you? It is a big farce. 

When i bring this up...no one ever says im wrong.  They tell me to go away and say a variation of the following : "" hey the markets only go up.  They have been calling for recession forever now,,and it never happens"" ""go away. Buy guns and ammo you weirdo""   


I dont expect the average person to know this. (Since most people dont  follow  fiscal policy closely)


But for those that know better , we have to start addressing this and start discussing how to hedge just in case the same ""buy the dip"" stradegy of the past 25 years fails.  We owe it to the future generations to be honest about whats going on in this country with the economy amd markets. We need to get our collective heads out of the sand and discuss this consistently openly and honestly.  Make it normal and remove the taboo. 

 investment subs continue to sweep this under the rug as if this isnt a glaring issue.  At what cost do we keep assett prices going up forever??? Massive inflation for your children???  

What will it take for society to stop being short-sighted and let all markets reset for the greater good of the future?


Im yelling into the void. No one will care or listen. But i hope to at least start the conversation

1ay8rhw,investing,opinions on my investment strategy.,"Hi there! I’m looking for some opinions on my investment strategy.

Assume this scenario:  
\- Mid 30’s.  
\- Saving \~100k per year.  
\- Current portfolio is several hundred thousand. 2/3 in cash 1/3 in VFV.  
\- Wanting to “retire” in 6-8 years with \~$3,500/month in dividend income.

The thing I care about most is monthly cashflow. I’m not hugely concerned with overall capital appreciation as long as my monthly income is enough to cover living expenses. For instance, if I can have a \~8% yield on cost on $750,000 I’m fine with that, rather than spending time building to 1.5M yielding 4%.

I want a simple ETF system I can continuously plug excess cash into to keep growing monthly income.Rather than investing purely in more growth oriented ETFs, I’m thinking of focusing mostly on Canadian and USA dividend aristocrat tracking ETFs with decent dividend growth rates, and just building that up with DRIP and new contributions over the next several years.Attached are some images that represent my estimated numbers.

I would be interested to hear your opinions on this strategy, rather than investing for capital growth, focus more on dividend growth over a medium time horizon.

My portfolio would hold ETFs like CDZ, HYLD, VEQT, XEI, and perhaps some VFV. If you look at the rough math, even the capital appreciation works out similar to a growth focus when you factor in DRIP. On top of that, if stocks go down, then DRIP just buys more for the money, increasing overall income.

Is there anything I’m missing or not considering?

1ay2gua,investing,The weird psychology of selling a portion of your stock,"On one hand when I sell a few shares, I want to see the price go down afterwards so I know I sold at a good time.

On the other hand, I still have stock invested, so I certainly want to see the price go up, whether I sell a portion of it or not.

So maybe it's always a win/win situation.  Or maybe always lose/lose?   Can it somehow always be neutral -- the price doesn't matter *at all* when you sell a small number of shares?  So confusing.

I suppose it depends on the % you sell -- for a small sale %, you still *always* root for the price to go up and never worry about selling a few at the right time.  Just sell and move on.   Only for a large sale % does it make sense to ""root"" for the price to go down.  But even then it feels wrong since I have some left still, even if it is a small amount.",2024-02-23 14:57:35,2024-02-28 20:00:19.479235,5 days 05:02:44.479236,7,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ay2gua/the_weird_psychology_of_selling_a_portion_of_your/
1axqdrd,investing,Gene Munster - Dan Nathan - Other Bear Nvidia Analysts Get This One Thing Wrong. There will be NO Glut Or Epic Fall - Nvidia is Now a Cloud Provider of Accelerated Compute,"Gene was giving a great analysis of Nvidia potential headwinds into the future of this AI Super Cycle.  
  
<video here>  
  
The problem is I don't think these analyst are getting how Nvidia works which is weird because they literally have direct access to Jensen.  
  
I think the word ""Data Center"" is confusing. I think they believe that data center means something that is not cloud like but rather a super computer that is shipped to someone who then uses it in the cloud. And that's it they ship the hardware and Nvidia never sees them again.  
  
That's not what is going on here.  
  
First, Nvidia can direct sell you cloud like access to all their hardware and software services all by themselves.  
  
NVIDIA DGX Cloud is a serverless, AI-training-as-a-service platform for enterprises that depend on AI.  
  
With integrated best-in-class software, direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, and near-limitless access to high-performance compute, DGX Cloud delivers industry-leading utilization efficiency with scale and productive work capacity for developers—at the lowest TCO compared with traditional infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) approaches.  
  
Dan Nathan just seems either confused or just willfully attempting to rally a short position. I lean to the latter because I can't believe he is actually believing what he is saying but I could be wrong.  
  
Maybe Dan is just confused.  
  
Second, You can then access Nvidia with all of it's software and services FROM effectively a third party such as Azure or AWS. Why would someone go this route? The reason is many times companies have contracts in place to get discounted compute from 1 or 2 cloud providers. So, they sort of go all in with Microsoft Azure as an example. The legal and contract agreements are in place for the entire IT department to use ""whatever"" is in Azure. Well, if Nvidia cloud can be accessed in Azure that's great because all of the engineers and DS's can have access without going through and getting agreements in place for Nvidia directly.  
  
There is obviously the chance of more cost but for the lack of headache it is probably negligible. But, every situation is different. Point is, that is money that is going directly to Nvidia (and probably the serving cloud provider at some portion) because at that point Microsoft or AWS or Google is only a passthrough. This is very much the same for other provider as well such as MongoDB and Redis Labs.  
  
Now, on the other side Microsoft, X and AWS have every right to purchase, store and assemble their own solutions with purchased hardware from Nvidia and others and also provide and direct sale their own option.  
  
See that's the difference of HARDWARE sales and CLOUD INCOME. I haven't heard this on the conference calls and would be great if someone talked about it because it would become so much more clear. You must understand the distinction to understand Nvidia's current business model right now.  
  
Back to Gene. So the the mistake that everyone keeps making is that they're saying the BUST or the apocalypse MUST come for nvidia because once they sale all of the hardware then nobody is going to buy anymore. Thus the ""GLUT"".  
  
That's not how this is working. You have to get your mind out of the Crypto/NFT ponzi scheme to understand this.  
  
Crypto had a bunch of GPU's going up against a supply / demand model of increasing BitCoin price. When the bitcoin price crashed. Everyone holding a warehouse of GPU's costing millions in electricity suddenly didn't want to be a bitcoin miner anymore. Hence, a bunch of GPU's that nobody wanted. The ""GLUT"". This was probably max of Bitcoin falling to \~12000. It's also why ETH and others wanted to go to ASICS and get off the Bitcoin hype cycle.  
  
Nobody talks about AWS or Azure or Google's ""GLUT"" concern with bought servers and hardware. Nobody. AWS and Azure update their cloud server options all of the time. It's a natural cycle that is smooth and calculated.  
  
Why is it not conceivable that this will be similar for Nvidia?  
  
Everyone is trying to predict the day Nvidia falls instead of trying to think ""hmm"" maybe, just maybe, Nvidia is growing as a cloud offering with software, hardware and service. Sound like IaaS? Because it is.  
  
It's the same concept as general compute but with accelerated compute. The software stack is why you would go for Nvidia as opposed to using a different cloud provider native abstraction.  
  
MongoDB in Azure Cosmos is not as good as MongoDB direct to Mongo IN Azure. Or at least that might be a consideration for you.  
  
Speaking of Data storage companies one could make an analogy here.  
  
Data gets stored and then you access said data.  
  
LLM's get trained and then you access said LLM.  
  
The only difference is that the LLM needs compute to run it. Less than training compute but still accelerated compute.  
  
The training doesn't happen one time and that's it. You could train a model and it suck and then you have to retrain it. Or you need to update it so you have to retrain it.  
  
The money it cost to train is in the million's. multiple millions of dollars for foundational LLM's.  
  
There will be no more glut here than there is in any other cloud providers for general compute.  
  
There will not be a ""BUST"" this time. So don't worry Dan, you can come out of the shorts and join the rest of us into the future.",2024-02-23 03:23:52,2024-02-28 20:00:19.479240,5 days 16:36:27.479240,22,0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axqdrd/gene_munster_dan_nathan_other_bear_nvidia/

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns. And you can choose to ignore them if they are outside your risk and comfort level. That makes perfect sense.

1awyoh4,investing,Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number,"My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. 

> Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. 

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

1axrow5,investing,"Healthcare ETF for HSA, specifically VHT","I saw a pretty interesting strategy the other day and wanted to hear the communities’ thoughts on it.

If you compare a common healthcare ETF, like VHT for instance vs the total stock market, the healthcare fund actually outperforms the total stock market and with less max drawdown. So better performance and less volatility. Will this outperformance continue? Maybe, maybe not.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5xXJ6wBNCXzqUi7OEIMyxu

However, the second part of this strategy is what makes it interesting: Investing solely in VHT in your HSA. The reasoning being if healthcare costs go up in the future, the main beneficiaries of that would be healthcare stocks. The gains in this would then be used to offset the cost of healthcare expenses in the future when you have to draw upon your HSA, probably retirement age or older.

It’s sort of a hedging strategy on healthcare costs. If the costs of healthcare goes up, the healthcare stocks benefit and your HSA will reap those benefits. If the costs of healthcare goes down or even extreme case, there’s universal healthcare, then the HSA is only a small part of your portfolio and you’ll already be ahead by the lower costs of healthcare anyways.

1ax2fmy,investing,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.

**#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don’t teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don’t outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.

**#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don’t always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don’t think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.

**#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don’t know what that is, just follow your intuition. It’s your best guide. Don’t choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.

**#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets — like different industries and geographies — that will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that’s best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.

**#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.

**#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don’t want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don’t generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don’t make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.

**#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.

**#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don’t obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don’t revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path. One that this universe has crafted just for you.",2024-02-22 09:32:57,2024-02-28 20:00:19.479306,6 days 10:27:22.479307,29,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ax2fmy/wealth_advice_i_would_give_to_my_younger_self/
1axkxfn,investing,How to read ratios from Yahoo Finance,"I was frustrated trying to look these all up separately, so I'm making my own post as a reference. I took an investing course and these are generally the numbers that are good.

This is not an exhaustive list, but please reply in the comments with ratios I've missed, and what numbers we should be looking for so people can open this, and search the thread.

A good **Sharpe ratio** typically falls within the following ranges:  
  
Greater than 1.0: Considered acceptable to good by investors.  
Higher than 2.0: Rated as very good.  
3.0 or higher: Considered excellent.  
Under 1.0: Considered sub-optimal

**Beta** \- Measure of risk. A score of 1 matches the market. 1.5 means if the market moves 1, that stock moves 1.5. A score of 0.5 means if the market moves 1, it moves 0.5. Higher the number, the more volatility. 

A good **Treynor ratio** is typically higher than the market’s ratio, which serves as a benchmark. Historical data suggests that the market’s ratio is usually around 1.

**Price/earnings (P/E) ratio** \- Lower the better. Less than 2.5 is good.

**Price/sales (P/S) ratio** \- Lower the better. 1.0 - 2.0 is good. Less than 1, excellent.

**Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio** \- Below 1.0 is good value

**Price/book ratio** \- Range 1.0 - 3.0. Less than 1.0 is excellent.

**Enterprise Value/revenue ratio (EV/R)** \- Good is between 1.0 - 3.0. Lower is better.

**Enterprise value/ EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (EV/EBITDA)** \- Less than 10. Lower is better.

**Price/cash flow (P/CF)** \- 10 or less. Lower is better

**Price/free cash flow (P/FCF)** \- 15 or less. Lower is better.

**Dividend payout ratio** \- Less than 50% excellent. 50-70% good. The higher, the more cautious you should be.",2024-02-22 23:13:51,2024-02-28 20:00:19.479311,5 days 20:46:28.479311,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1axkxfn/how_to_read_ratios_from_yahoo_finance/

1ay01bj,investing,The Rise of Old West Carson City Coins: A Digital Era Investment Opportunity,"  
In the fast-paced world of digital transactions and virtual currencies, the allure of physical coins with historical significance is experiencing a resurgence. Among these coveted treasures are the Old West Carson City coins, particularly Morgan Dollars, Twenty Cent Pieces, and Trade Dollars. While these coins have long held value among numismatists and collectors, recent shifts in global currency dynamics are poised to exponentially increase their worth.  
  
As the world steadily progresses towards the widespread adoption of digital central bank currencies, the role of physical currency is undergoing a transformation. The elimination of physical currency is not merely a hypothetical scenario but an inevitable reality as governments and financial institutions embrace the efficiency and security offered by digital transactions.  
  
This seismic shift in currency dynamics will have profound implications for physical coins with historical significance, such as those minted in Carson City during the Old West era. As physical currency becomes increasingly scarce, the demand for tangible assets with intrinsic value has been  skyrocketing. Elite collectors and savvy investors alike are seeking out coins with rich historical narratives and tangible scarcity.  
  
Among the most sought-after Old West Carson City coins are Morgan Silver Dollars, with the highest demand for the CC-minted 1889 Morgan, CC-minted Twenty Cent Pieces, and CC-minted Trade Dollars. These coins, minted in limited quantities and imbued with the spirit of the Wild West era, hold a unique appeal for collectors and investors seeking tangible assets with enduring value.  
  
The distinctive ""CC"" mint mark, signifys their origin in the heart of the Old West.   
  
Twenty Cent Pieces minted in Carson City are prized for their rarity and historical significance. Minted for only a brief period from 1875 to 1878, these coins represent a fascinating chapter in American coinage history.  The Trade Dollars minted in Carson City are also poised to experience a surge in demand among elite collectors. These coins, originally minted for trade with China and other Asian markets, hold a unique place in American numismatic history. 

As the world adapts to digital central bank currencies attentive Investors are beginning to seek out tangible assets with historical significance, and it's driving demand and increasing their value to unprecedented heights. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity that many Investors will miss. While the opportunity is here and now for physical, tangible investments most Investors are looking in the wrong direction for new opportunities.

As the title suggests, I am considering investing in Venture Funds. For context, I normally invest with Schwab, but I have a SoFi account and am considered a “SoFi Plus Member” (whatever that means) so I received a notification about IPO access and ended up getting distracted while checking it out and started looking into their Venture Fund offerings - which is why I’m writing this post.

I’m asking because, although they’re already risky, I noticed that they have insane gross/net expense ratios compared to ETFs, making them even more risky. 

Taking calculated, sensible risk that I can justify isn’t really something that typically bothers me, but this seems kind of like instead of mitigating my risk, I’m just hedging my risk with even more risk. On the bright side, the investment minimums are low, so that definitely counts as a positive! 

Does anyone have any thoughts? 
Some examples of the rates are below.

Fund 1 - $2500 minimum, 5.7%gross expense ratio / 2.9%net expense ratio

1axawcd,investing,When is the best time to roll an IRA to Roth? ,"I had an old 401k from a previous job that was performing atrociously for years, and I decided to roll it to an IRA to get better investment options. Mission accomplished, and it's now growing comfortably, but I'm realizing that I might want to use the backdoor Roth strategy in the future, and would be hit by the pro-rata rule. 

When would be the best time to roll this thing to Roth? Are there any strategies that would make this easier? Some considerations:

- The current size of the account is $12k. I could afford the taxes on that, but it would eat up nearly the entire raise I just got.

- The markets are at all-time highs. I know it would be best to roll when the markets are down, but there's no way to time a crash. The longer I wait to roll, the higher my tax bill could potentially get. 

- I don't expect to lose my job anytime soon, but who does? 

Is it better to put off paying taxes as long as possible, but potentially pay higher total taxes in the long-term through pro-rata as the account grows? Or is it better to just get it out of the way now, before the account grows any larger?

1ax7twb,investing,Questions about 401k Breakdown,"Hi all- I have a couple questions about my 401k. To start with, there's the breakdown:

Employee Pre-Tax: 100% vested (7k)


Employer non-elective: 0% vested (5k)


Safe Harbor Match: 100% vested (7k)


The 401k is put into the Vanguard Target Retire 2060 Trust 1 and it through Empower (previously Prudential) and I'm contributing 6% pre-tax. My employer match should also be 6%. 


My questions are as follows:
1) What is the safe harbor match?  

2) Is the 2060 Trust 1 a good investment to be putting my 401k into?


Thank you for your time!

1axdh13,investing,"How can I reprogram my mind to be ok with large winners, and to cut losses when it's beneficial. ","I'm still a 'baby' investor of around 3 years, but I think I've done well psychologically on being calm when prices fall, and not getting over excited when they increase a lot. At least on broad market indexes. 

For individual stocks positions, however, I find myself struggling to hold on to EXTREMELY large winners, when I do have them. I know the phrase goes, ""water your flowers and cut your weeds"", or something like that. But for example, I've been trimming my meta position, which is currently up almost 200%. And have been trimming since it hit around 170-80% return (money weighted). On one hand, I do believe the market is in a frenzy, and don't feel comfortable in what could be a bubble, but am I being too fearful of profits? 

I'm not asking for personal advice on one stock in particular, rather, how to be more comfortable with letting winners run. But perhaps I already am, since I held for so long, and am only worried now with how hyped the market is? 

Another thing, is cutting losses. On a few stocks, I'm down 20-30%, and while I'm not uncomfortable with holding where I see a positive future, in some companies I don't. I know it's sunk cost fallacy, but my own psychology won't let me let go of those positions. Advice here also welcome.

1awbqfp,investing,"Reddit Plans to Reserve Shares for Its Big Users in IPO, WSJ Reports","Social media platform Reddit plans to sell a chunk of its IPO shares to its platform's users, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.  
It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.  
The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.  
Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.  
The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.  
Reddit's IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest's debut in 2019.

1awqkqx,investing,Matt Levine (Bloomberg) on the upcoming reddit IPO,"Matt Levine is alway funny and interesting and he hits on all the pluses and the many minuses regarding the reddit IPO and the supposed offer to some redditors. The thing about reddit is that it is just that, reddit. There isn't much of a moat, just ask the Digg guys how that went.


I guess there are three ways to look at this:

Reddit plans to place a big chunk of its IPO shares in the hands of its users, an unusual move that could build loyalty but also comes with risk. 

The company plans to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, according to people familiar with the matter. The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors. 

Ideally for the company and its underwriters, Reddit shares will rise in their stock-market debut, bestowing big gains on those who buy in at the IPO price. If the stock falls, however, it could anger those members of Reddit’s community — a group that, broadly speaking, hasn’t shied away from boycotts in the past.

Banks generally favor selling the bulk of an IPO to big money managers that tend to hold stocks for a relatively long time. Individual investors are viewed as more fickle and prone to selling at the first sign of weakness.

One is the sort of philosophical view. Reddit Inc., more so even than most social media companies, is a publisher that doesn’t pay its writers and editors. It runs a website that publishes huge amounts of content on various message boards; the boards are mostly moderated by volunteers and the content is written by users. From this, Reddit generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from ads and data. For the most part, the users do not really share in that revenue.

This model works fine — It is in fact the case that the users happily post and moderate on Reddit without getting paid! There is no need to pay them! — but it is awkward, particularly when an initial public offering is set to value the company at more than $5 billion. “We created $5 billion of value and get none of it,” some redditors will probably complain. Letting them buy stock at the IPO price doesn’t really address that complaint — they still have to pay for it! — but it sort of symbolically responds to it. “We let our users share in our success, by paying full price for the stock,” Reddit can say; it’s fine, whatever.[1]

The second is the conventional capital markets view. Here, the rough idea is that banks sell the stock in an IPO mostly to big institutional investors, most of whom they expect to buy and hold the stock. Then the next day, the stock opens for trading, and lots of people — institutions that didn’t get allocations, but also retail investors — want to buy it. But there’s not a lot for sale, because most of the IPO was placed with long-term holders. So there’s a lot of demand and not much supply, so the stock goes up, creating an “IPO pop.” This means that it is generally good to get an allocation in the IPO: You buy stock in the IPO, and the next day it reasonably predictably goes up and you make money. And retail investors mostly don’t get to buy a lot of stock in IPOs, so they miss out on this pop.

Letting individual redditors buy stock in the IPO sort of addresses this problem: The redditors get to buy stock at the institutional price, and then it goes up and they make money. On the other hand, if you let the retail investors buy in the IPO, that kind of ruins the mechanism that leads to the IPO pop? The devoted retail investors who want to buy the stock do so in the IPO, rather than having to wait until the next day, so there’s not as much demand when the stock opens for trading. And a lot of those retail investors might be looking to make a quick buck by flipping the stock, so there is more supply. So there’s less reason to expect a pop. “If everyone buys at the IPO price then there’ll be no one waiting to buy it the next day,” I wrote, when Robinhood Markerts Inc. tried this sort of thing, “and everyone who bought it to make a quick profit will be selling it at a loss.” (That did happen to Robinhood, though then it rallied hard the week after its IPO, so who knows.)

The third is the meme-stock corporate finance view. Most companies are mostly owned by big institutional investors, there are fairly traditional ways to keep those investors happy (steadily increasing earnings, clear communications, stock buybacks, etc.), keeping those investors happy keeps the stock price up, and a high stock price is good for the executives (who get paid largely in stock) and for the company (if it ever needs to raise money by selling more stock). But in the 2020s, some companies are owned in large part by retail investors, and some of those investors are more interested in being part of an online community of investors, and trading jokes and memes, than they are in financial analysis. And you can make those investors happy in less traditional ways, like by giving them popcorn or buying a gold mine or doing a YouTube interview with no pants on.

Lots of corporate executives want nothing to do with this, but some executives lean into it. And why not? Sometimes companies (1) need to raise money (because their business is in trouble) and (2) can’t do the traditional things that make investors happy (because their business is in trouble). Having some source of funding that is orthogonal to traditional business success seems like a good insurance policy: “If our business ever gets into trouble and we need money, we can always make some jokes with our retail investors and they’ll give us the money.” 

Not every company can get meme-stock investors. But you know who probably can? The whole idea of meme stocks originates with Reddit; Reddit’s boards are where the great meme stocks were created; Reddit is where the online communities of investors are. Surely Reddit has some advantages in appealing to retail investors on Reddit. It might as well get some of them in its stock early.",2024-02-21 23:12:25,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326128,6 days 20:47:56.326129,36,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awqkqx/matt_levine_bloomberg_on_the_upcoming_reddit_ipo/

1aweeqt,investing,"If the best strategy to make money is to buy and hold an index fund, who is keeping the market “efficient”?","I always hear that actively managed funds (and individuals) fail to beat indexes such as the S&P 500. If this is the case, how does the market stay efficient when instead of needing to research companies based on their fundamentals, capital just flows into the top 500 companies with no regard to whether or not they are actually good companies?

It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:

1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.

2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies. 

Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes. 

If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of “you can’t beat the market” is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.

1axei3n,investing,Nvidia-fueled tech rally puts Nasdaq Composite record in sight,"Hah. I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago!  

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era

From MarketWatch:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-fueled-tech-rally-puts-nasdaq-composite-record-in-sight-59951214?g=ad5aec42-f1a1-40d9-aa8d-ab928ce5fed8&mod=djem_mwnbulletin

> An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**

> The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.

> If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Wow

> The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024.

> The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, 

There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days. 

Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. 

Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn’t go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.

1awjtwt,investing,"Confused about rolling over 401k, backdoor Roth and pro-rata rule","Hi all,

I've done some research and searched old posts but haven't found myself grasping the considerations around rolling over my old employer 401k.

Situation is as follows:

I have a Traditional 401(k) at T. Rowe Price from an old employer, balance is around $75k with $65k being contributions and $10k earnings.

The rest of my retirement accounts are at Vanguard, where I have two 401(k)'s from previous employers, a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The Traditional and Roth IRAs at Vanguard are used for backdoor Roth each year, as our income is over the limit for directly contributing to Roth IRA.

My goal is to simplify life by moving the 401(k) to Vanguard. As best I can tell, I'm paying $36/yr in fees to T. Rowe Price at the moment. I am currently not employed and so do not have an active employer 401(k) that could accept the rollover from T. Rowe Price 401(k).

I have read that high income earners should not rollover a 401(k) to a Traditional IRA because of the IRS pro-rata rule impacting backdoor Roth IRA, though I can't say I could explain why that is. However, I do know that I want to continue doing backdoor Roth IRA each year for the next 20 years or so.

I am considering rolling over the T. Rowe Price Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA and taking the income tax hit on the $75k now, in order to get 20+ years of tax-free growth in the years ahead. In this case, would I still run into issues with future backdoor Roth IRA contributions and the IRS pro-rata rule?

TLDR: If I convert a Traditional 401(k) from an old employer to a Roth IRA, will it compromise my ability to do future backdoor Roth IRA contributions?

Thanks for reading, any advice appreciated.

Edit: For the folks commenting that now is good time to do Roth conversion since I am not working, I should have mentioned that my spouse is a high earner and we expect our joint earnings to be at our current income level or higher in future years.",2024-02-21 18:45:45,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326241,7 days 01:14:36.326241,14,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awjtwt/confused_about_rolling_over_401k_backdoor_roth/

Hi all,

My spouse and I have about $500k in a MMF currently generating interest at 5.43% and are looking to make a better use of the money until we buy a house in 2-3 years. One idea was to take a portion ($250k+) and short-term trade in VOO/VTI, buying and selling within a few days. Having watched how those two move for the past year, it seems like it could work if I sell even after a 0.1% increase, but I do realize there is always a risk with stocks. 

Does anyone short-term trade a large sum of money, specifically in VOO/VTI? Am I gambling too much doing this? I will appreciate any insight/advice/warnings.

1awo8wa,investing,"63 years old, looking for investment advice…","63 year old with a few investing questions…

I am 63 years old and I have a few investment questions I’m hoping this community can help me with. I would like to invest 50k with a hard money real estate lender, expecting a projected return of 8-11% per year.

I have three sources that I could use for the investment:
1.) A self directed IRA (SDIRA)
2.) 401k
3.) Edward Jones account

My money accounts are invested 65/35 in age appropriate investments. I would try to keep the ratio the same using the conservative money from those accounts.

My questions are as follows:

1.) Do they withhold taxes at the time of the withdrawal from 401k and Ed Jones?

1a.) If so, how much would I have to withdraw to net 50k? I’m in the 24% tax bracket.

2.) One CPA advised against using SDIRA money. I believe it creates a UBIT tax? Not sure what that is but other than that I’m not sure why.

3.) Is it a bad idea to withdraw the money now at my age? It will be reinvested conservatively.

Any other advice or thoughts is appreciated.",2024-02-21 21:41:15,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326261,6 days 22:19:06.326261,14,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awo8wa/63_years_old_looking_for_investment_advice/
1awwhhr,investing,Am I on the right track with investments? ,"Trying to figure out if I’m in a good place for my age (30 years old). I think I’d like to retire at 55-60 years old. I currently do not have any debt(no car payment, I always pay my cc each month, student loans paid for, and no mortgage). I do not own, I rent. It’s expensive where I am and at this point I don’t have a 20% down payment for a home - plus the homes where I live are just beyond outrageous. I think I’m fine renting for awhile. 

I am contributing 10% of my income to my 401K. Currently around 70K in there. I obviously didn’t always contribute that much but I’ve made more money over the years as I’ve moved up with my company.  They match 6%. I am considering bumping this up even more - probably 15 percent which is still a little below max contribution but my commission can vary so I want to be cautious. I also am almost making too much money for a Roth IRA. 

I am a part of an Employee stock purchase plan which offers stock at a discount and have been contributing 5% of my paycheck for the last almost 7 years. I also have received RSUs each year and am receiving even more per year with a promotion. So total value of this is 71K with a potential value of 18K that hasn’t vested yet - and more RSUs to come each year. 

A few years ago I started a health savings account. Currently only putting in what my company matches which is $750. So that’s 1500 a year. I’ve not invested any of this but am considering it. I have about 5K in there. 

After just staring at my dividends and unsure what to do with them (probably should have reinvested but whatever 🫠) I decided to use them to buy 6 shares of the ETF ITOT. I’m going to start off with 100 bucks a month into this but want to see how increasing my 401K contributions plays out financially first. The ETF world is a little new to me. Just starting out. A lot of my 401K is invested in vanguard so I figured it would be good to do an ETF that wasn’t vanguard for diversification reasons? This could be inaccurate thinking so open to feedback here. 

I’ve been saving since I got my job 7 years ago. I use to make much less so it’s been an up hill climb. But I have 26 grand in savings which I feel is a little disappointing. I have also just never really heard of a High Yield Savings account until recently so I just moved everything over and started saving in that account last year. I was putting around 250 a paycheck in there for around 6 years (having to dip in occasionally for unexpected vet or car bills for example). If my commission checks were a lot and I had left over pay I’d just send it over to the savings account. I now put around 600-1000 a month in the savings account depending on commission checks. I know it will grow faster because my contribution amount has increased recently but idk not feeling great about it. 

But anyways - is this a good place to be financially? Any advice at all? I’m always over fixating and worrying I’m not doing enough.

Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s. 

Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like; not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations.

Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted.

1awi9lb,investing,What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?,"I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",2024-02-21 17:44:41,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326405,7 days 02:15:40.326405,1,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awi9lb/whats_the_role_and_future_of_intel_in_taiwans/
1awndjc,investing,Exploring Development Options for Commercial Property Near a Hospital,"I've come across a bit of a crossroads with a piece of property I own and could use some outside perspective. I have land near a hospital, and I'm considering what would be the best use for it.  
Given its proximity to a healthcare facility, the location seems prime for something that could serve hospital visitors or staff. Currently, the land is zoned for commercial use, but I've been toying with the idea of getting it rezoned for residential purposes. The thought process here is to potentially build apartments which could be really convenient for hospital employees or those with loved ones in long-term care.  
The question I'm grappling with is whether the rezoning effort, which I know can be quite a process, would be worth the potential gains. Apartments could fill a real need, providing housing solutions right where people work or visit frequently. On the flip side, keeping it commercial could also present opportunities for businesses that complement the hospital's services.

1awtvvs,investing,Dividends are not better than capital gains. Retirees should focus on total return and taxes.,"There always a post about asking about dividends for retirement. Can anyone tell me why retirees should focus on them over something like total return? I don't see a point in buying dividend stocks/etfs for retirement when a total return approach is much better.

*edit: Also why are dividends considered safe? The dividends can be cut at anytime and the stock of the company also isn't guarantee to be stable. WBA had to cut dividends and the stock is doing pretty bad.*

1avt0yx,investing,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&P500,"Man I’m kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven’t checked on it in a while.   It’s supposed to be “aggressive” at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that’s what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don’t understand why TDF’s are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren’t we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn’t maybe read the room and see we’re in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?

I’m going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.   

I know TDF’s are popular here but I just don’t understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don’t think I’m ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that’s a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF’s inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.

1awhjkz,investing,CNBC Market Coverage Overview,"The trading platform my work uses only has CNBC and no Bloomberg so I’m forced to watch it and here is what I have found. Thought I would share:

Squawk Box: Good show and often has the best guests. Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen are both solid interviewers but polar opposites. Andrew is a bit more liberal while Joe is a bit more conservative, they mix well together and Becky provides a good buffer between the two

Squawk on the Street/Money Movers: Good show but it is basically Cramers show. Carl doesn’t do much other than read a headline and let Jim rant. Faber is mostly a M&A guy and doesn’t provide much when acquisitions are slow (like now). Faber is a bachelor who when asked what his favorite part about being on CNBC said is that he gets to go to Saks and pick out suits and CNBC pays for it all. After the first hour, Sara Eisen replaces Jim. And stays on until Wapner and Halftime. Sara is very meh, not great but not awful. While Jim is very focused on individual stocks, Sara is more macro and provides some decent color. You’ll see a lot of good interviews during these times but it’s mostly just CEO’s talking up their companies or activists/short sellers just advertising their positions so be weary.


Jim Cramer: Ok Cramer gets his own section for obvious reasons. A lot of people give Cramer a hard time but I like the guy and think he truly means well and wants to help people. The thing is, is that when you spend years talking about stocks all day, you’re going to be wrong sometimes and he has been wrong and people seem to amplify them and forget about his winners. Nevertheless, the guy is clearly smart (Harvard, Goldman, Hedge Fund) and super well connected and gets great CEOs and guests on Squawk (and Mad Money) despite often asking really tough and direct questions. He is also funny and is able to provide you a good Birds Eye view of companies that are trending that you would otherwise not care about. People say he only talks about stocks he owns and that is true but on purpose as that is what his whole hedge fund strategy was built on before he went on TV. The guy would just talk up stocks he owned to analysts in the 90s and those analysts would talk about the stock, causing people to flock in and the price to rise. Overall, I think Cramer gets a bad rap given what he provides, that’s not to say he is perfect or to take anything he says to your brokerage account but he definitely does not deserve an entire inverse etf

Halftime Report: I usually turn off the sound here as this segment can get annoying. Wapner is alright and can often challenge the guests but it’s hard to tell if I like him as the guests are just abysmal. Most of the guests just like to hear themselves talk. Josh Brown thinks he is Warren Buffet and Scott will never challenge him. Joe T has an etf. If you didn’t know, dont worry, he will mention it multiple times. Stephanie Link just never stops talking. Some of the other guests are good but they can never get a word in because those three love to talk and Scott never interrupts them. Overall, the segment is very foggy as many of the guests are trying to sell themselves/the funds or companies they work for so it can be hard to take anything away from what they say without a large grain of salt that they have other motives for advertising their positions

Power Lunch: I really like this segment as both Kelly and Tyler are laidback and not too serious. No good guests but you often see a lot of interesting stories that aren’t as widely covered. Not much to this part but a good listen as the trading day winds down

Closing Bell: Another solid segment as Scott is good here and the guests are often solid. Nothing too exciting but a good end of the day wrap up.

I usually turn it off after closing bell so can’t provide much color after that but thought I would share my two sense on CNBC market coverage throughout the trading day",2024-02-21 17:16:35,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326470,7 days 02:43:46.326471,9,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awhjkz/cnbc_market_coverage_overview/
1aw6pkf,investing,Stockanalysis on Zalando - Europe E-Commerce Player,"Hi Guys, please mention any flaw you see in my reasoning on the stock or in the numbers I mention, because I know humans are not perfect, especially me.

So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.

Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

Strategy:

So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.

(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)

Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.

I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.

Financials and Macro:

So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -

These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.

A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.

So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.

Now to their Balance Sheet: They have

around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.

Market Cap: 5.17 Billion

So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.

Risks:

The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H & M and less from Fashion Brands.

Of course many people would also think, that amazon will just also take the fashion e-commercemarket very easily, however i think, that people want a special place for buying their brand clothes and don't want to search bar for their product of choice. More and more of the sales will be impuls sales, with the customers scrolling through the app at a busstop and just buying something that they like, which is not possible with amazon, due to their big supply of many other things, than brand clothing.

Another risk is, that the macro enviroment right now is much worse and the DACH Market where around 45 % of their revenue lies, is growing a bit slower than the 8 % Cagr in Europe. Even though this is possible, their DACH-Market already is very profitable, with a 6 % operating margin despite the way lower gross margin, so the very likely higher growth rate in their rest of europe department could lead to higher Operating margins here, due to more growth and the operating leverage, that comes with it.

So i think most of the European e-commerce stocks are really undervalued and even though we won't see the growth rates from the covid e-commerce hype, these buisnesses will still grow at very decent rates and should further improve their profitability, which makes Zalando in my opinion a good investment.",2024-02-21 08:00:45,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326476,7 days 11:59:36.326476,3,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/

This would be $14,000 total contributed into my father IRA for this year, is this okay since they file taxes jointly?

Basically, holding any security for more than 2 years, you pay 0% when selling the security. If you sell the security earlier than that, you pay a flat rate of 10% of the profit. 

I am 23 years old and my goal is to one day purely life off of my investments. I would need around 25-30k euros/year to live comfortably.

1awa695,investing,"Advice on QDVE and ETF's in general, risks and how holdings are managed?","Hi Reddit,  
I've been investing in the QDVE ETF, which focuses on S&P500 technology companies, for about a year. My interest in technology and its potential drove me to this ETF, and so far, I've been pleased with its performance. However, I'm aware of the risks, especially with a sector-focused investment like this.  
I'm seeking insights into the specific risks associated with a technology-focused ETF like QDVE, as well as any ETF in general. I understand that markets can fluctuate and sectors can underperform, but I'm particularly interested in the factors that could lead to a downturn in this type of ETF. Also, I'd like to understand more about how the holdings are managed. For instance, QDVE has significant portions in companies like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. If a company like NVIDIA were to perform poorly, how would the portfolio manager handle this? Can they adjust the holdings to keep the ETF stable, and if so, how does this process typically work?  
Any advice on mitigating these risks and protecting my investment, as well as insights into the management of ETF holdings, would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks in advance for your help!",2024-02-21 11:49:18,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326504,7 days 08:11:03.326504,2,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1awa695/advice_on_qdve_and_etfs_in_general_risks_and_how/

I currently work in such a company that is well established and the stock has been beating the market for over 10 years now. My understanding is that this all comes from 3rd party audits since it is not on the open market. 

If you are in this situation, what did you do? Buying year to year seems like a bad strategy if you have cash on hand because if it keeps going up, you are just paying more for it next year. Of course it could be heading for a cliff and when a company is large enough, you hardly have any better perspective on its future prospects than when looking at a public company (unless you are really high up).

1awrxz2,investing,Should I take half of my VOO and invest in higher performing stocks with tight stop loss in place? ,"For the remaining VOO I am invested in I was thinking of putting a trailing stop loss on most/all of it and then reentering after the dip is over and it's back on the upswing again. This way I would avoid major drops in my VOO and would constantly reinvest back in it once the storm is over. It's already happened to me twice over the last month where I was up about 3k on my existing VOO and then the market tanked and I lost most of my gains. Hopefully this idea will help reduce the negative impact. 

As of right now the stocks that I am eyeing to invest the other half of my current VOO in would be IHG, AWI, VST, and CRH. Once these get stopped out from the trailing stop losses that I set then I would reevaluate whether to add them back in or screen new stocks to replace them with that are at least beating VOO over the long term.

1avl95c,investing,Why did the market think the Fed would cut rates this year?,"I'm wondering if there's a logistical reason to why the market tried to call the Federal Reserve's bluff to rate cuts this year? 

&#x200B;

I'm unsure why the market would just go about and assume that rate cuts ""had to happen"" and price in 7 rate cuts, when the fact is this is an election year. The Federal Reserve claims to have no part in our political system, so I don't understand why they would want to give any perceptions or assumptions of anything going on until after the election in November is finished? 

&#x200B;

To me it seems pretty clear cut that unless something breaks significantly (large bank failures such as JP Morgan or Capital One or Wells Fargo, etc) - that there is no reason to lower interest rates until after the election. Inflation is still a big question. YoY CPI is around 3% but inflation is still 20-25% since 2020. The economy is ""booming"" if you take the jobs reports to be truthful. And in may ways if we find out the jobs numbers are lies, the market could react by having a huge surge which would cause more inflation. 

  
Europe and China are in recession, but that's no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the U.S. Like Bloomberg said all of last year - we have a case of American Exceptionalism here. 

&#x200B;

I think the stock market at best will be flat all year while people start to realize those rate cuts are not happening. Next year we may have a crash after the election is decided when they cut rates and it creates the ""perception"" that something is broken, even if nothing is ""broken,"" per-se.",2024-02-20 16:06:13,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326532,8 days 03:54:08.326532,110,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1avl95c/why_did_the_market_think_the_fed_would_cut_rates/

Long story short I worked my ass off and have been quite lucky. I have an accountant and I'll talk with him more about this when I go do my taxes as well but I'm mid 20s and have a business with 5 employees.

I take a salary of 70k. I work a ton so the math on the hours isn't great but I'm frugal and for now enjoy the work. Anyway it's all under an LLC right now and after all the business expenses are taken care of I'm still having about 12-15k a month left over. Currently my business account has a bit too much cash just sitting there.The business is in construction and while I don't want to scale this much more I have thought about branching out, outright building houses. Coupled with this I could take my lifestyle up a notch or two. Like I said not flashy but I do think I'd enjoy traveling more and traveling rich(er).

Or I up my salary start investing tons of money and retire early. Like forties. I could probably hire someone to run day to day but the hours are crazy bouncing between jobs and would realistically need 2 people. So it'd cost me a lot more than the 70k I pay myself. Would need a good nestegg saved up. 

What would you do? Right now leaning towards a soft retirement in my late 30s early 40s. Would hire someone to share the load of management but would still work some. If i start saving to retire early any pitfalls I should be aware of? Currently just have a Roth I'm contributing the max to which is all mutual funds and an account with about 50k in single stocks (thanks Nvidia lol). Also have like 12k in crypto.

And before anyone says anything I pay my guys well above market rate and give good bonuses I just got really lucky with some long term contracts (who you know who you blow).

I realize how fortunate I am in to be in this situation and I'm just a bit out of my depth with it. Ive just consistently asked people smarter than me for business advice and I'm here doing the same for money advice lol.",2024-02-21 06:24:54,2024-02-28 20:00:21.326550,7 days 13:35:27.326550,18,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw560f/how_to_save_to_retire_early_would_you_start/

1avf8au,investing,Sense check on savings account choices for a down payment,"New to this (be gentle 😘 ) so please lmk if my research below tracks. I've hopefully done most of the legwork. I am shopping for a savings product to stash a down payment. Savings window is probably a few years. I am currently in the Fidelity (brokerage), BOA (checking/Merrill Lynch brokerage), and American Express (card) ecosystems, and would prefer to stay there for my sanity, but y'know. 

Leading candidates are:

* FDLXX (doesn't accrue state/local tax?), currently at 4.94% w/ a .42% ER   

* BOA’s preferred deposit currently at 4.92%  


Seems like BOA PD’s is better for my situation:   
•	Looking at the cons: $100k entry is fine for me, 5 days or however much to withdraw is fine, clunkiness is a bummer but comparable to having to transfer from Fidelity to BOA anyway. I'd have to pay fed and state income taxes on the yield, vs. FDLXX paying fed gains and fed income taxes, and gains are both a lower rate and less likely to happen, which is a bummer. 9.3% CA tax on income means BOA’s rate is more like 4.46%.  
•	Pros: But BOA PD is easier to access in BOA ecosystem, counts toward preferred rewards, and avoids FDLXX's .42% MER which makes its yield more like 4.5% - whatever minimal gains. Do MMFs even make gains? Plus HYSA’s historically bottom out around 1% and often reach the 2s, while MMFs were \~0 in 2015, 16, 20, 21. Obviously you can move the money, but this is set and forget value.  
  
Also saw treasuries and municipal bonds and TIPS recommended for my sitch. See a huge selection of ML MMFs that kind of have me overwhelmed. Open to any suggestions there/tips on comparing.

My Roth is 90% stocks and 10% bonds. 

For the returns that I made last year, would it be smart to move that into bonds? 

As an example: 
If my returns were $5k for last year. Should I take that $5k and transfer it over to bonds? 

My thought is protect that $5k

* The portfolio is a total of 28 stocks. 3 consumer discretionary, 3 consumer staples, 2 financials, 4 industrials, 4 materials, 3 healthcare, 9 technology. 

* Each position is equal weight.

* I can only pick from the tech stocks listed below because of specific screening requirements.

* I am trying to diversify the tech holdings so they aren't all in very similar businesses. 

* This is a long term portfolio. Changes can be made in the future as needed, but I plan on DCA'ing into this on a monthly basis for the foreseeable future. 

Other considerations:

* I am clearly overweight tech. I am a big believer in tech outperforming in the long run. 

* I will be creating/investing in this portfolio with M1 finance, meaning I can create pies/ETFs with up to 100 stocks per pie/ETF. I can theoretically include as many tech stocks as I want and include that pie/ETF as a percentage of the overall portfolio.

Understand that no one here is giving me official advice I'm just gonna lay out my logic and would appreciate some guidance or other things to consider before potentially abandoning the idea completely or taking the next official step and setting up a consultation (either tradersaccounting or greeentrader, any others you suggest?).

Quick rundown, I have a normal day job w/access to health insurance and a 401k and also fund a roth IRA. I use IBKR and about 85% of my trading (about 3-4 round trips/month) is futures trades with the other 15% being options and etfs. 

So I DO NOT qualify anywhere near the 720 trades a year to make it to TTS status and if I understand that is the ONLY way I could look at writing off various legitimate trading expenses (home office, internet, etc.). 

I do beleive however if I do some sort of business for trading I may be able to get access to other retirement accounts (sep IRa?) that I may be able to shuttle more tax advantaged money tothus shortening my retirement timeline (not getting around minimum age but hope to be more ""ready"" by then). I don't know what other things could actually be considered a write off, you hear the joke about talking about ""business"" over lunch it has now become a tax write-off, not looking to do anything not legitimate but seems there are some advantages out there the average person can't do not owning a business. 

So far the main drawbacks I have seen from my research is potentially paying professional data fees (I use IBKR).

1avf7si,investing,Achieve 1 Million Dollars Net worth in 10 Years,"Though this may sound ambitious and partially unrealistic, I'd like to achieve a net worth of $1,000,000 in 10 years between my (1) Robinhood Account (2) WeBull Account (3) Roth IRA and (4) Work 401K.

1. I use the Robinhood account strictly for ETFs only. Currently contributing $2,000 a month..
2. I use the WeBull Account strictly for Individual Stocks only. Currently Contributing $500 a month. I purchase fractional shares for every $500 split between 14 different stocks. I do this to maintain an 80/20 ratio between ETFs and Stocks.
3. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA account and buy ETFs only. Any dividends received from the Robinhood and WeBull accounts will go to the Roth IRA to help achieve the annual contribution limit.
4. My company contributes a percentage of my earnings during their fiscal year. I calculated their annual contribution to average a minimum of $580 a month to my Pre-Tax 401(k). Their match is tied to my earnings during their fiscal year so I expect my company's monthly contribution to increase by a few dollars every year.

In total, I'm working with roughly $3,500 a month to investments. I paid off all debts and started the year with roughly 20k between all 4 accounts. I'd need to average at least 14.15% of growth over the next 10 years so that I break a million by January 2034. If this were possible, how could I achieve this? Should I adjust my ETF:Stock Ratio to 70/30 so that I can achieve a higher growth? I'm trying to mitigate my risk as much as I can but not too sure how to go about this and would like to hear everyone's thoughts.

1auux5r,investing,"UK investor – HL , Vanguard or Fidelity?","Hi all,

I'm a fairly new UK investor and I was wondering what the pros/cons are of Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard and Fidelity for someone like me.

I'll be mostly investing in index funds/ETFs.

I've had an account with HL for a couple of years, more for ease than anything else. However, it's increasingly the case that I see funds recommended that aren't available there.

Is Vanguard better for fund availability, and is it worth opening an account with them for wider scope?

I also have an account with Fidelity from way back when. They also seem to offer a wider range of funds, as well as being open to crypto ETFs (this probably isn't the space for that debate, but I admire their flexibility vs Vanguard's stance). However, I'm put off by their trading fees, which seem high.

I'm aware that HL fees can be high, but as I only really deal in index funds and not stocks, and tend to choose funds with lower ongoing fees, that seems to offset the problem.

Or if there's another platform that is better than all three, I'd be keen to hear about it.

Apologies if this question is duplicated elsewhere – happy to just follow a link if so.

Many thanks in advance.",2024-02-19 18:42:21,2024-02-28 20:00:22.415799,9 days 01:18:01.415800,4,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1auux5r/uk_investor_hl_vanguard_or_fidelity/

1aup1n7,investing,Total Gains / Lost when continuously investing,"My question: How are gains / losses calculated when you constantly invest?

For context I have about $15000 between ETFs and a HYSA. 
~10,000 in HYSA
~2,000 in QQQ
~1500 in SCHD

Looking at my gains / losses I’m only up 2%.

Couple of questions I have are:

1. How is this calculated? I just recently (last few weeks) I bought all the SCHD I have, and 2 more shares of QQQ. How are the gains / losses calculated even though I’ve already had some QQQ? Does it take into account say I bought QQQ at $400 a year ago (hypothetical) and it went up 10% to today. I bought more today ($440) and it went down 5% in a year ($418). My total gain / loss would be +5%? Is that right? 

2. Is my percentage of gain / loss because a small % of my portfolio is actually invested? I only have about $3700 invested and 10,000 in a HYSA. So portfolio wise I’m not up a bunch but individual ETFs I’m up around 20%? (QQQ is around +14% & SCHD is +6%)

Berkshire make their money off of dividends and profits from their investments and companies they actually own.

1at0rcx,investing,My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!,"**UPDATE:  The money was finally moved to her IRA after complaining up the chain of command.  But read forward to understand how crazy 401K to IRA Rollovers can be.**

My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)

She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.

So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check.

So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!

Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**  Yesterday, in total frustration, she talked to a supervisor and was told the same thing- the rollover is in process.

This could happen to any of us with any Investing/Brokerage Company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.

5+ million? Really? Is this legit?

I’m fairly confident at this point that the value of the dollar will continue to decrease so I’m looking for a way to proportionally grow the money I invest as the value goes down. I’ve thought about the forex markets but a little shakey on which currencies would be least effected by USD value going down. 

What other investment vehicles would you use if you were to bet on increased inflation?",2024-02-18 18:34:10,2024-02-28 20:00:22.415967,10 days 01:26:12.415967,150,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1au12xk/how_would_you_go_about_betting_against_the_usd/

1ate4w0,investing,Advice on ways to grow NW beyond just investing taxable brokerage accounts? ,"I just posted my NW here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/s/Bv0P91fuL4 

What I am looking for is advice on any other ways to grow retirement non taxable accounts?? I have learned a lot from reddit and while I am seeking Financial advisors, I want to be informed independently too. 

For several reasons I am quite behind on my 401k value as it should be per my age (been contributing since 2010.)

Mistakes I think I made:

1. Started contributing late. Missed out on 3 years of contribution into 401k

2. Didnt max out 401k contribution until 2-3 yrs ago. Was contributing around 6% or so. Match was 1.5% for many years. 

3. Stopped contributing to Roth as I was above income limits starting 2017. Didnt take advantage of backdoor etc

4. Didnt reinvest dividends in non taxable accounts. (All reinvested now.)

5. Didnt take advantage of HSA.

6. Lost NW from Divorce. (No pre nup)

7. Didnt take advantage of additional contribution from my company for certain employees. ( a company benefit I missed out on).

What I am doing now:

1. Fully maxed out on 401k

2. Working through backdoor/megabackdoor to start the roth contributions each year.

3. Currently investing in Tbills (moved away from CDs) for tax reasons. (Laddered Tbills 6 months and a year). Doubt i”ll have this option in the future.

4. In 8 yrs when I am 50 and if the law still allows then I”ll take advantage of  the catch up contribution but its not much. 

No HSA available to me. 

My Question - What else can I do to grow my non taxable account value? 

Is all my NW going to come from taxable accounts? With high CA taxes, lawyer fees each year (hoping it will be resolved next by end of year) and forced to put house purchase on hold I dont know what else to do other than start really cutting on expenses to Grow my savings.

NW: ~ 1M; break down is as follows:

1. 290k in brokerage account

2. 200k Tbills

3. 100k HYSA which is my EF

4. 200k 401k, TiRA and Roth

5. 210k in RSUs vested

HHI: 600k depending on stock price.

(Car loan is already deducted from the liquid assets I have. No CC debt as its paid off every month. I Invest 1000 per month in stocks since last 2 yrs - had a gap of 3-4 months due to large expenses. Saving 5-10% each paycheck into HYsA.) 

Everything currently points to just building and growing my taxable assets - brokerage, HYSA and perhaps in the future rental / primary property. 

Is that really the case?",2024-02-17 22:24:12,2024-02-28 20:00:22.416009,10 days 21:36:10.416009,8,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ate4w0/advice_on_ways_to_grow_nw_beyond_just_investing/
