Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

It blows my mind. Amazon and Google are power houses with some of the greatest company “moats” I’ve ever seen. Nvidia is definitely dominating their market but it sure doesn’t seem they have nearly the diversified portfolio these other heavy weights do. Or the protection from another company catching up.

1b3nv12,stocks,(Reuters) Walt Disney's grandchildren back CEO Iger and current Disney board and slam activist investors.,"*""Feb 29 (Reuters) - The grandchildren of Roy and Walt Disney, founders of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), opens new tab, have backed CEO Bob Iger and the board, while opposing activist investors encircling the company.The four grandchildren of Roy Disney - Roy P. Disney, Susan Disney Lord, Abigail E. Disney and Tim Disney - in an open letter to Disney shareholders expressed concerns about the threat posed by ""self-anointed"" activist investors, calling them ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" waiting to tear the company apart.*

*In January, Peltz's Trian Fund Management had urged Disney shareholders to replace directors Michael Froman and Maria Elena Lagomasino with Peltz and former Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo.

1b3kl34,stocks,"Tesla stands to earn billions by opening U.S. chargers to drivers of Ford, other EVs","As of Thursday, owners of Ford electric vehicles — the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning — in North America finally have the ability to power up using Tesla Superchargers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley wrote in a post on LinkedIn that the charging partnership, which involves use of fast-charging adapters, should “improve the EV ownership experience,” for Ford EV drivers, noting that “I’ve tested it myself and its works great.”

Tesla has forged a similar agreement with General Motors, which was announced in June, giving GM customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla fast chargers in the U.S and Canada. GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.

The partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla’s charging network and his company’s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.

But Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.

Sam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.

Currently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, “Tesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,” by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.

While Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.

“People shopping for a Tesla aren’t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,” Fiorani wrote. “Competition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.”

Allowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Tesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,” Fiorani wrote.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for further information.

Tesla reports charging revenue with its “Total automotive & services and other segment revenue.” The company hasn’t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.

William Navarro Jameson, Tesla’s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of “interoperability testing” along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.

“There have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,” he wrote.

On social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.

1b3xvkb,stocks,"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely to be over","Derek Horstmeyer(repost)

*Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*  
  
*To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*  
  
*The final list of named trends we researched was:*  
  
*-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*  
  
*-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*  
  
*-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*  
  
*-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*  
  
*-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*  
  
*-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*  
  
*-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*  
  
*-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*  
  
*Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*  
  
*From first mention*  
  
*Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*  
  
*For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.*  
  
*The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.*  
  
*Worth the ride, until...*  
  
*But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.*  
  
*Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.*  
  
*When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.*  
  
*On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.*  
  
*All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.*",2024-03-01 16:04:21,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656236,0 days 01:39:55.656236,17,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/
1b3kc05,stocks,Why is the Japan stock market going up when its economic is doing very bad? What Am I missing?,"\- Japan  slipped into a recession at the end of last year, losing its title as the world's third-biggest economy to Germany.

\- Japan factory output falls at the fastest pace in nearly four years. Industrial output fell 7.5% in January 2024 from the previous month, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed. 

\- ""The plunge in industrial production in January suggests that GDP will fall yet again this quarter, which will add to the view that Japan's economy is in recession,"" said Gabriel Ng, assistant economist at Capital Economics.  
\- Production declined the most in motor vehicles, down 17.8% in January from the previous month. Output decreases in regular passenger cars and electrical drives systems pulled down the overall figures.

\- Birth rate reached to historically low last year. And the administrative even says that if they don't reverse this by 2030. There is no turning back but nose-diving crash. 

And now, Warren Buffet in his annual letter claiming that he will keep holding and buying more Japanese stock for indefinite period of time as he already hold 8.5% across the group of top five firms. Buffett had previously expressed caution about investing in foreign companies, citing his inability to forecast foreign-exchange movements. Despite this, he has shown a clear interest in Japan’s economy. And he has been praising about Japan future economic several occasions now.

This is not some speculative movement, He's talking about long-long term investment like 10+ years. I just can't understand how can someone be optimistic about Japan economic given its aging population, birth rate, and recently performance.

1b3nuaj,stocks,(Time Magazine) Reddit files to list IPO: Why Reddit Users Have Turned Against the Company’s IPO,"*Two years ago, Reddit users established themselves as a fearsome economic force when the subreddit community WallStreetBets mobilized to save GameStop’s stock price from pessimistic Wall Street traders. Now, Reddit itself is hoping to tap into its users’ unruly energy by allowing them to participate in the company’s IPO. Reddit filed to go public last Thursday, seeking a valuation of at least $5 billion. Crucially, the company said it would set aside a large number of shares for 75,000 of the company’s most prolific users, who might be able to profit off the company’s financial success and have a seat at the company table. “Now you can become one of our (non-corporate) overlords,” Reddit wrote in a public statement.*   
  
*But rather than galvanizing the community, the news was met with fierce backlash and pessimism from many Redditors. Users on various subreddits responded by casting doubt on the company’s business model, complaining about recent changes to the site, and ironically threatening to wield their collective power to bet against the company’s stock. The overwhelming negativity from Reddit’s own community highlights the risk of the company’s decision to go public and the challenges of social media companies keeping both their investors and users happy at the same time.*   
  
***User Backlash***  
*Reddit is one of the most-visited wTebsites in the U.S., with 73.1 million daily active users. But the company is still unprofitable: While it grew 21% in revenue last year, it also lost more than $90 million—although that was an improvement on the $158 million it lost the year before. Compared to Instagram, X and other social media platforms, Reddit has especially struggled to monetize its audience through ads, partially because its content is generally more freewheeling and untamed than its counterparts.*   
  
*The company has many high-profile backers, including Tencent Holdings, Fidelity, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who was once briefly Reddit’s CEO. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will serve as the offering’s lead underwriters. But very few companies have even decided to go public in the last few years, due to a turbulent stock market and high interest rates. Reddit will be the first major tech initial public offering of 2024, and the first social media IPO since Pinterest in 2019.*   
  
*Reddit is powered by users who post content and moderate the site for free. (Last fall, Reddit announced that users who created viral posts would be able to earn money.) And while Redditors tend to be intensely devoted to their subreddits, many have grown increasingly disillusioned with the platform overall. Last summer, hundreds of Reddit communities engaged in a widespread blackout to protest price changes for third-party app developers.*   
  
*Now, many Redditors see the IPO as another example of how the company is prioritizing its bottom line at the expense of its users. “If anything I think it devalues Reddit because now the board has to do things for investors instead of doing things for the Reddit community,” wrote one user.*   
  
*Ed Zitron, the CEO of EZPR who also publishes analysis on tech and social media via a podcast and a newsletter, argues that Reddit’s lack of focus on monetization is exactly what makes it so special as a platform. “Reddit is one of the last bastions of user-generated content on the internet that’s actually reliable and well-policed,” he says. “But the current way Reddit works is antithetical to good advertising.”*  
  
*In order to try to make the community feel included in the IPO, Reddit has established a “Directed Shares Program,” which lets the most active Redditors buy shares at the same discounted price as major investors. But many Redditors responded to that idea with disdain as well. “They're trying to trick us into buying their stock to pump the price,” wrote one user. Another compared the program to a company throwing a pizza party for its workers, but then forcing its workers to buy the pizza.*   
  
*One Redditor, Matthew Benedict, wrote in a message to TIME that they were invited by Reddit to participate in the IPO, but have no plans to buy any shares. Benedict is a moderator for* r/LegacyJailbreak*, a community with 45,000 members that offers tips about circumventing software restrictions on Apple devices. The user said that recent changes to Reddit have made it harder for moderators to lead their community. “I'm not optimistic and find it very ironic that they want to invite moderators to participate in the IPO after making changes that have prevented my fellow moderators from moderating,” they wrote.*  
  
*A spokesperson for Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.*   
  
***Training Artificial Intelligence***  
*As is the case with many business decisions this year, artificial intelligence is playing a role in Reddit’s decision to go public. Reddit just announced a licensing deal for Google to use Reddit data to train and build its A.I. systems. Steve Huffman, Reddit’s CEO, said in a public letter that the platform’s “data advantage” in training AI models will allow the company to earn revenue. Reddit expects to make more $203 million over the next three years from data licensing agreements, according to the IPO filing.*  
  
*But on Reddit, users voiced concern that AI advances could only increase the proliferation of chatbots on the site. One user speculated that Reddit could be particularly susceptible to an increase in bots compared with other social media platforms, because most of its users are anonymous, reducing the site’s appeal.*   
  
*Zitron says that Reddit’s issues with bots aren’t unique, but potentially damaging all the same. “Like any other social media platform, there are forces at play who are going to spam it with nonsense and manipulate Reddit to their advantage,” Zitron says. “If it’s AI that’s upvoting and downvoting posts, that will destroy the fabric of what makes Reddit useful.”*  
  
*Nick Smith, a senior research analyst at the IPO-focused Renaissance Capital, says that Reddit’s data partnerships will help contribute to the company’s growth and profitability. “But it’s down an uncertain path,” he says. “Reddit is highly unprofitable: Over the last 3 years, it hemorrhaged more than $300 million in free cash flow. That’s one of the big issues, because investors are focused on profitability, and being more discerning in that aspect.”*  
  
***The Wall Street Bets factor***  
*Looming over Reddit’s IPO is the subreddit* r/WallStreetBets*, which is one of the platform’s biggest and most powerful communities. In 2021, its users banded together to invest in “meme stocks” like GameStop and AMC, wreaking havoc on Wall Street trading firms that had bet against them. Their actions forced major investors to rethink the very premise of what made a stock valuable.*   
  
*If* r/WallStreetBets *gets involved in the Reddit IPO, the community holds the collective power to move the company’s stock price in unpredictable ways. While professional investors participating in IPOs typically hold shares for a long time, individual investors often sell shares more actively, leading to price swings. Reddit acknowledged this in its IPO filing, writing in its Risk Factors section that the participation of Redditors could “result in increased volatility.”*   
  
*In 2021, Robinhood, a stock trading app that itself was lifted up by* r/WallStreetBets*, went public and similarly allowed its ravenous users access to the IPO. But Robinhood’s stock price dropped significantly after going public and has failed to come close to its IPO price.*   
  
*The Robinhood IPO saga did not go unnoticed by WallStreetBets—and many people on that subreddit responded scathingly to Reddit’s own IPO announcement. Users especially took umbrage with Huffman’s more than $193 million compensation in 2023 (including stock and option awards), while volunteer moderators who do the heavy lifting of organizing and overseeing the site’s communities make nothing. Many users actually threatened to “short” Reddit’s stock: to bet on its failure. “They're selling user generated content to AI companies without offering user compensation,” wrote one user, adding: “Short these pricks.”*  
  
*Smith believes it will be difficult and expensive for retail investors to actually short sell—effectively bet against—Reddit’s IPO in its initial trading days.

*However, there are some users who still believe in the site’s viability and the potential of the IPO to be successful. One user, who said his name was Kevon but asked to remain anonymous over concerns about his job and personal life, wrote to TIME in a direct message that he planned to buy shares in the IPO, believing that the current negative sentiment was more of a product of Reddit’s tendency to devolve into hivemind than any actual expertise or insight. “Every year there are comments that the site/company are going downhill from what it used to be,” he wrote. “Yet it continues to grow at a rapid pace.”*

1b3cejl,stocks,"Shares of NYCB fall more than 10% after bank discloses 'internal controls' issue, CEO change","Shares of New York Community Bancorp fell 12% in extended trading Thursday after the regional lender announced a leadership change and disclosed issues with its internal controls.

The regional bank announced that Alessandro DiNello, its executive chairman, is taking on the roles of president and CEO, effective immediately. NYBC has been under pressure in recent months due in part to concerns about its exposure to commercial real estate.

The bank also announced its fourth quarter results, which included a disclosure about its internal risk management.

“As part of management’s assessment of the Company’s internal controls, management identified material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls related to internal loan review, resulting from ineffective oversight, risk assessment and monitoring activities,” the company said in a filing.

1b3sbtp,stocks,ITV shares jump 16% after it sells BritBox stake for £250m,"Shares in ITV PLC (LSE:ITV) jumped 16% after it said it had sold its half share of the BritBox streaming service to BBC Studios for £255 million with the proceeds used to fund a share buyback programme.

Announcing the disposal, the broadcaster said the move would allow it to focus on enhancing its domestic streaming platform, ITVX, and expand its global Studios division.

After accounting for loan repayments and tax, the deal will net £235 million. 

ITV stock, off 27% in the last year, was up 8.02p at 63.96p in morning trade.

Under the terms of the transaction, ITV will maintain a revenue inflow from BritBox thanks to new extended licensing agreements.

""The sale of 50% of BritBox International means ITV is focused on its core strategic goals of continuing to build on ITVX's success and growing ITV Studios,"" said ITV CEO Carlyn McCall.

1b401sy,stocks,Boeing in talks to buy back fuselage maker Spirit Aerosystems,"Boeing is in talks to buy back Spirit Aerosystems, which makes fuselages for Boeing’s 737 Max jets, according to a person familiar with the matter, as both companies scramble to stamp out manufacturing flaws on the top-selling plane.

Shares of Spirit were up 13% as of early afternoon on Friday, while shares of Boeing were down about 1%. Spirit Aerosystems had a market capitalization of $3.3 billion as of Thursday’s close.

“We do not comment on market speculation,” a spokesperson for Spirit Aerosystems told CNBC. Boeing also declined to comment.

Boeing in 2005 spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit Aerosystems. About 70% of Spirit’s revenue last year came from Boeing, and about a quarter comes from making parts for Boeing’s main rival, Airbus.

The repurchase talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

It comes less than two months after a section of a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded all of the planes in January, leading to investigations into the accident and Boeing’s production lines.

It was the latest and most serious in a host of flaws on the Boeing 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling jet.

The bolts on the door plug of the Max involved in the January accident appeared not to have been attached when it left Boeing’s Renton, Washington, factory, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board.

Boeing has disclosed several production problems and quality flaws on the fuselages that Spirit makes, including incorrectly drilled holes and incorrect spacing on some fuselage components, problems that slowed deliveries of new jets to airlines.

1b31nk9,stocks,"Key Fed inflation measure rose 0.4% in January as expected, up 2.8% from a year ago","[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html)

Inflation rose in line with expectations in January, according to an important gauge the Federal Reserve uses as it deliberates cutting interest rates.  
  
The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs increased 0.4% for the month and 2.8% from a year ago, as expected according to the Dow Jones consensus estimates.  
  
Headline PCE, including the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.3% monthly and 2.4% on a 12-month basis, compared with respective estimates for 0.3% and 2.4%, according to the numbers released Thursday by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.  
  
The moves came amid an unexpected jump in personal income, which rose 1%, well above the forecast for 0.3%. Spending decreased 0.1% versus the estimate for a 0.2% gain.  
  
January’s price rises reflected an ongoing shift to services over goods as the economy normalizes from the Covid pandemic disruptions.  
  
Services prices increased 0.6% on the month while goods fell 0.2%; on a 12-month basis, services rose 3.9% and goods were down 0.5%. Within those categories, food prices accelerated 0.5%, offset by a 1.4% slide in energy. On a year-over-year basis, food was up 1.4% while energy fell 4.9%.  
  
Both the headline and core measures remain ahead of the Fed’s goal for 2% annual inflation. While the Fed officially uses the headline measure, policymakers tend to pay more attention to core as a better indication of where long-term trends are heading.  
  
Wall Street reacted little to the news, with stock market futures up slightly and Treasury yields slightly higher. Futures markets where traders bet on the direction of interest rates also indicated little movement, with pricing tilted toward the Fed’s first rate cut coming in June.  
  
“Overall, \[the report\] is meeting the expectations, and some of the worst fears in the market weren’t met,” said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Société Générale. “The key is we’re not seeing the broad nature of increases that we had been more fearful of.”  
  
Thursday’s BEA report also showed that consumers are continuing to dip into savings as prices stay elevated. The personal savings rate was 3.8% on the month, slightly higher than December but off a full percentage point from where it was as recently as June 2023.  
  
In other economic news, a Labor Department report showed that companies are still reluctant to lay off workers.  
  
Initial jobless claims totaled 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 24, up 13,000 from the previous period and more than the 210,000 Dow Jones estimate but still largely in keeping with recent trends. However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, rose to just above 1.9 million, a gain of 45,000 and higher than the FactSet estimate for 1.88 million.  
  
The reports come as central bank officials mull the future of monetary policy following 11 interest rate increases totaling 5.25 percentage points. Running from March 2022 to July 2023, the hikes came as the Fed battled inflation that peaked at a more than 40-year high in mid-2022.  
  
Officials have said in recent days that they expect to begin reversing the increases at some point this year. However, the timing and extent of the policy easing is uncertain as recent data has indicated that inflation could be more stubborn than expected.  
  
January’s consumer price index data raised fears of persistently high inflation, though many economists saw the rise as impacted by seasonal factors and shelter increases unlikely to persist.  
  
While the CPI is used as an input to the PCE, Fed officials focus more on the latter as it adjusts for substitutions consumers make for goods and services as prices fall. Where the CPI is viewed as a simpler price measure, the PCE is viewed as more representative of what people are actually buying",2024-02-29 14:30:37,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656287,1 days 03:13:39.656287,144,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b31nk9/key_fed_inflation_measure_rose_04_in_january_as/

1b3cqy5,stocks,FSLR is a gem mixed in with some terrible solar companies,"I really don't understand why people are so excited about $ENPH when there is another company actually PRINTING MONEY hand over fist FIRST SOLAR $FSLR is the WINNER.  


$FSLR is utility scale solar and not rooftop solar which is the segment been facing interest rate pressure.

Valuation Metrics: First Solar currently trades at a lower trailing P/E ratio (19.28) compared to Enphase (38.67), indicating that it may be undervalued relative to its earnings. Furthermore, First Solar's forward P/E for 2024 is significantly lower (11.31) than Enphase's (38.61), suggesting that First Solar may offer better future earnings potential at a more attractive price.  


Analyst Price Targets: Analysts have a bullish outlook on First Solar, with an average price target of $223.28, representing a substantial upside potential of approximately 45% from the current price. In contrast, Enphase's average price target of $131.74 implies a more modest upside of about 3.7%. If First Solar were to be trading at a similar Trailing P/E of 38.67 that would put their share price at $299.30 or about a 94% upside.  


Market Position and Demand: First Solar has established itself as a leader in utility-scale solar projects, with a remarkable achievement of being completely sold out through 2026. This strong demand underscores the company's ability to secure long-term contracts and generate steady revenue streams. The company's recent earnings report demonstrated its resilience to interest rate fluctuations, further highlighting its ability to maintain stable revenue amidst changing market conditions. With a robust backlog of orders and a clear path to future growth, First Solar is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for renewable energy solutions.  


Risk Factors: While both companies face regulatory and policy risks inherent to the renewable energy sector, First Solar's exposure to potential policy changes is mitigated by its diversified customer base and long-term contracts. Additionally, the company benefits from tax credits that support its growth initiatives, providing a buffer against regulatory uncertainties. First Solar is also largely immune to interest rate volatility as seen in their most recent earnings.

Economies of Scale and  Competitive Advantage: First Solar's focus on utility-scale solar production allows it to benefit from economies of scale and cost efficiencies that are difficult for competitors to replicate. With a strong emphasis on innovation and technological advancements, First Solar is well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge in the market  


.First Solar has an average analyst EPS target for 2025 of about $21, that means they are trading at 7.3x 2025 earnings which is INSANE. Even if the tax credits stopped in 2025, which again is highly unlikely, they would still be generating EPS of approximately $14, putting them at 11x 2025 forward earnings (non-tax subsidized earnings). The inflation reduction act allows First Solar to create a moat that will be almost impossible to cross in the future. Come on people, open your eyes and realize you can shoot fish in a barrel or chase nonsense.Literally all you have to do is take two minutes and go to yahoo finance and look at the numbers. Just compare them, and you will see that this is a stock that's being largely overlooked.",2024-02-29 22:00:30,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656296,0 days 19:43:46.656297,38,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3cqy5/fslr_is_a_gem_mixed_in_with_some_terrible_solar/
1b31r82,stocks,"Birkenstock beats revenue expectations on higher pricing, U.S. demand","Birkenstock on Thursday beat holiday quarter revenue expectations, reporting a 22% year-on-year jump, as the German sandal company benefited from higher pricing and rising U.S. demand.

As a newly public company, Birkenstock is still getting into a public reporting rhythm and only just released its fiscal 2023 results and 2024 guidance a little over a month ago. On Thursday, it said it stands by guidance issued then and still expects sales to be between 1.74 billion euros ($1.89 billion) and 1.76 billion euros ($1.91 billion), representing growth of 17% to 18%.

Here’s how the shoemaker did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 9 euro cents adjusted vs. 9 euro cents expected

Revenue: 302.9 million euros vs. 288.7 million euros expected.

The company reported a net loss of 7.15 million euros ($7.75 million) for the three-month period that ended December 31, or a loss of 4 euro cents per share. A year earlier, it reported a loss of 9.19 million euros ($9.96 million), or a loss of 5 euro cents per share. Excluding one time items, Birkenstock reported a profit of 17 million euros ($18.4 million) or 9 euro cents per share.

Sales rose to 302.9 million euros ($328.5 million), up 22% from 248.5 million euros ($269.4 million) a year earlier.

CEO Oliver Reichert has said the company deliberately engineers its distribution strategy so demand is higher than supply but its working to build out its production capabilities to narrow that gap. The chief executive said those investments, along with other efforts the company is undertaking to drive growth, is having a “planned” but “temporary” impact to profitability.

“Our results for the first quarter of 2024 once again demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strong sustained demand for our products. Given our engineered distribution model, demand continues to outpace supply in all regions, channels and categories,” said Reichert. “In the medium-term, we are confident we will continue to deliver our objectives of a gross profit margin over 60% and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the low thirties percent.”

The company’s gross profit margin inched down to 61% from 61.7% during the same period last year, with Birkenstock citing “unfavorable currency translation and the planned, temporary under-absorption from our ongoing capacity expansion.” The company said it continues to carefully track input costs and is mitigating inflationary pressures with “executed, selective price increases.”

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% year-on-year to 81 million euros, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9%, down from 29.1% a year earlier.

The newly public shoemaker, which started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BIRK” in October, saw a muted debut when it first hit the public markets, with shares sliding more than 12% on its first day as a public company. Shares have since rebounded and are up more than 5% this year, as of the Wednesday close. 

In January, the company reported its fiscal 2023 results and said it was the most successful year in the company’s nearly 250-year long history. Sales grew 20% and the retailer made strides in growing its direct-to-consumer business, which comes with better profits and more customer insights than relying on wholesale partners. 

During the quarter, Birkenstock saw more gains in its direct channels and said DTC sales accounted for 53% of overall revenue.

As other retailers like Nike, Under Armour and Timberland-owner VF Corp contend with soft demand in North America, Birkenstock reported outsized strength in the region with sales up 21% during fiscal 2023. That momentum continued during its fiscal first quarter with sales up 14% in the region. In Europe, where demand in some parts has been softer than in North America, sales grew 32%, and in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, revenue jumped 47%.

The recent growth comes several years after private equity powerhouse L Catterton acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock in 2021, ending nearly 250 years of family ownership that began when German cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock founded the company in 1774. 

Birkenstock’s new owners set off on an aggressive growth strategy that focused on growing direct-to-consumer sales, exiting certain wholesale partnerships and focusing on driving sales of items with higher price points. Within a few years, its sales nearly doubled and its market cap is now around $9.7 billion, double its 2021 valuation of $4.85 billion. 

Since going public, Birkenstock has used some of its proceeds to pay down debt. In the fall, it made a number of debt payments that reduced its net leverage. As of the end of December, Birkenstock was levered at 2.6 times EBITDA.

I was beginning to think the standstill would slowly damage their brand over time.  Also union efforts only seem to be growing over time at SBUX chains (at least US) so ignoring it and sweeping it under the rug doesn't seem like a smart solution.  Getting a contract signed is probably in the interest of all parties including shareholders.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/starbucks-workers-united-union-agree-to-start-collective-bargaining-contract-discussions/ar-BB1j3vw8

>Starbucks announced Tuesday that it will begin discussing potential collective bargaining agreements with the labor union representing nearly 10,000 employees from around 400 stores.

>The coffeehouse chain's decision comes nearly three years after Workers United, an American and Canadian labor union, initially organized baristas at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York.

>""Starbucks and Workers United have a shared commitment to establishing a positive relationship in the interests of Starbucks partners,"" Starbucks said Tuesday in a statement. ""During mediation discussions last week for the ongoing brand and IP litigation, it became clear that there was a constructive path forward on the broader issue of the future of organizing and collective bargaining at Starbucks.""

>In addition to opening up discussions, ""as a sign of good faith,"" Starbucks agreed to allow employees represented by Workers United to receive credit card tips from customers and other benefits, which the company announced in May 2022, according to Starbucks' statement.

>""While there is plenty of work ahead, coming together to develop this framework is a significant step forward and a clear demonstration of a shared commitment to working collaboratively and with mutual respect,"" Workers United said in a statement. 

>**Starbucks, Workers United relationship taking turn for the better**

>Starbucks and the union's relationship began going in the right direction in December 2023 when the company sent a letter to Workers United as an ""attempt to propose a path forward that would allow us to resume productive contract negotiations.""

>""We collectively agree, the current impasse should not be acceptable to either of us,"" Starbucks said in the letter. ""It has not helped Starbucks, Workers United or, most importantly, our partners. In this spirit, we are asking for your support and agreement to restart bargaining."" 

>**Pending lawsuit between Starbucks, Workers United**

>Despite efforts to improve the relationship, both sides still have ""outstanding litigation,"" which Starbucks said Tuesday it hopes to resolve with the labor union.

>The company sued Workers United in October 2023 over pro-Palestinian social media posts shared by the union's account, which angered hundreds of Starbucks customers, put other employees' safety at risk and blemished the chain's reputation, according to court records. Starbucks filed the suit in the Southern District of Iowa.

>The company also sued over Workers United's ""unauthorized use of the famous Starbucks name and logos that copy the famous Starbucks logos,"" court records show. The company accused the union of using ""copycat logos"" to promote fundraising, sell merchandise and falsely promote political and social topics on behalf of Starbucks. 

>Starbucks requested a jury trial and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the union from using logos similar to theirs, court documents show.

>Workers United countersued against Starbucks in a Pennsylvania federal court and requested that the union be able to use Starbucks' name and similar logos, according to court records. Workers United also accuses Starbucks of defaming the union by associating them with terrorism. 

>**Starbucks announced pay raise, Workers United planned 'Red Cup Rebellion'**



>After filing the suit, Starbucks announced in November 2023 that it would increase hourly wages and benefits for most U.S. workers. The pay raise came after the company had a fiscal year with record sales, according to a statement by Starbucks.

>During the same month, Workers United planned a strike that led to thousands of Starbucks employees at hundreds of locations walking out during Red Cup Day.

1b2knaw,stocks,"EA to lay off 5% of workforce, or about 670 employees","Electronic Arts
 announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games.

EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.

The company’s announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. 

On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent’s Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is “streamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.”

The cuts will support EA’s “strategic priorities and growth initiatives,” according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be “substantially complete” by the end of December.

“We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,” Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. “We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.”

Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its “biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.” 

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.

1b2jned,stocks,"Paramount falls short on revenue but posts profit, strong streaming results","Paramount Global missed revenue expectations for the fourth quarter on Wednesday but posted a surprise quarterly profit and posted strong results from its streaming platform Paramount+.

Here’s how Paramount performed in the fourth quarter compared to Wall Street estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. an expected loss of 1 cent

Revenue: $7.64 billion vs. $7.85 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Paramount reported a profit of $514 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $21 million, or 1 cent per share, the year prior. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share were 4 cents for the period.

Paramount — home to brands such as CBS, Showtime, BET, Nickelodeon and its namesake movie studio — reported a 6% year-over-year revenue decline but posted notable strides in its streaming segment.

Paramount+, its flagship streaming service, reached 67.5 million subscribers during the period, a net increase of 4.1 million, and recorded 69% revenue growth year over year. The company expects to achieve profitability for Paramount+ by 2025, it said Wednesday.

Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew 43%, partially driven by price increases, and revenue across its entire direct-to-consumer segment grew 34%.

Paramount saw a 27% jump in global viewing hours across Paramount+ and Pluto TV during the fourth quarter.

“Looking ahead, we continue to be focused on maximizing the return on our content investments and scaling streaming, while transforming the cost base of our business,” CEO Bob Bakish said in a press release. “And I couldn’t be more thrilled with the early momentum we’ve had across every platform in 2024, demonstrating the power of our strategy and assets.”

Paramount has been exploring sale options for all or parts of its business in recent months as the media landscape rapidly changes. Paramount has struggled without a solid growth narrative, with shares down more than 50% over the past two years.

Warner Bros. Discovery had been in preliminary talks to acquire Paramount, but those talks have since halted, CNBC’s Alex Sherman reported Tuesday.

Paramount announced about 800 layoffs earlier this month, just a day after the company revealed it had reached record viewership numbers for this year’s Super Bowl.

The company on Wednesday reported its TV media revenue declined 12% year over year. Advertising revenue declined 15% due to overall “softness in the global advertising market and 5-percentage point impact from lower political advertising,” according to the earnings release.

Revenue in Paramount’s filmed entertainment sector sank 31% year over year, driven by lower licensing revenue.

1b3szt8,stocks,Why I Think Big Lots ($BIG) Is Very Undervalued,"**What Is Big Lots?**  
  
Big Lots is a retail store that offers competitive pricing for many basic household needs and furniture. They operate 1,300 brick and mortar locations in 48 states and are currently expanding its online store. The company’s mission is to “ Help customers ""Live Big and Save Lots"" by offering bargains to brag about on everything for their home, including furniture, décor, pantry essentials, kitchenware, pet supplies, and more.”  
  
**Company Financials:**  
  
**Revenue and Net Income**  
  
Many perceive Big Lots as a struggling business with declining revenues, in reality, the company has experienced steady growth in its revenue. However, this growth does not match the rapid increases seen by many similar companies. For example, one of Big Lots’ competitors, Target, has seen multibillion-dollar growth in revenue year over year, due to factors such as third-party sellers, extensive brand awareness, and a better online customer experience. Big Lots lacks these attributes, which can be blamed for the slower revenue growth it has seen.  
While revenue has been growing slowly for Big Lots, the same cannot be said about its net income. The company's profit margin has dipped into the negatives multiple times and remains low compared to the industry average. These challenges can be blamed on significant inefficiencies in the company. These inefficiencies include an oversaturation of stores, large stores serving small locations, outdated technology and services, overstaffing, and more, which eat away at potential profits. Addressing these inefficiencies across the company could lead to a significant increase in net income and cash on hand.

  
**Debt:**  
One of the most significant challenges facing Big Lots is the exponential growth of its debt. When a company attempts to turn itself around, a common side effect is the accumulation of debt. Big Lots has amassed $3.33 billion in debt while having only $45.6 million in cash or cash equivalents, creating a risky financial position. This poses a significant risk to the company, potentially pushing it toward bankruptcy. Moreover, the high debt is compounded with extraordinarily high interest rates, which could hinder the process of turning the company around.

**Why do I think BIG is undervalued?**  
  
Currently, Big Lots may be an once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity due to several factors that suggest it is undervalued in the stock market. Despite facing challenges, the company's solid revenue growth, added with its turn around plan, indicate potential for future profitability. On top of this, Big Lots has a strong and experienced management team that can help guide the company during the turn around phase. While researching Big Lots’ financials and core values, it becomes evident that Big Lots is positioned for a turnaround that could significantly enhance shareholder value.

I currently own 359 shares of BIG @ 5.68 a share

1b2hu4v,stocks,Salesforce slips after the company calls for single-digit revenue growth,"Salesforce shares slid 6% in extended trading on Wednesday after the business software maker issued a light revenue forecast for the new fiscal year. It will start paying a dividend at 40 cents per share.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.29, adjusted, vs. $2.26 expected

Revenue: $9.29 billion, vs. $9.22 billion expected

Salesforce’s revenue grew 10.8% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, compared with a loss of $98 million, or 10 cents per share.

During the quarter, Salesforce said it would acquire sales commission software startup Spiff for undisclosed terms and was starting to sell its products on the Amazon Web Services marketplace.

Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.37 to $2.39 per share, with $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been expecting $2.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.15 billion in revenue.

For the new 2025 fiscal year, Salesforce said it sees adjusted earnings of $9.68 to $9.76 per share and $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion in revenue. The revenue figure implies 8.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts had expected $9.57 per share, along with $38.62 billion in revenue.

Excluding the after-hours move, Salesforce shares have risen about 14% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 6% over the same period.

1b27suh,stocks,Stripe all but delays IPO. Valuation rises to $65B,"

Feb 28 (Reuters) - Stripe's valuation surged to $65 billion in a deal that will allow some of its employees to cash out their stock in the company, the payments service provider said on Wednesday.
The so-called ""tender offer"" could allow Stripe more flexibility with its plans to file for an initial public offering (IPO), which investors and analysts have been anticipating for years.
Stock-based payouts typically comprise a big chunk of the compensation for startup employees, who have no way of converting their shares into cash unless their employer files for an IPO, raises funds in a private round or buys back their shares.
Stripe and some of its investors have agreed to buy some shares of current and former Stripe employees, the company said.
It did not disclose the names of the investors participating in the round. But the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the deal, said Sequoia Capital and Goldman Sachs's growth equity fund were involved.
Stripe declined to comment beyond its statement.
The company was valued at $50 billion in its last funding round in 2023 where it raised $6.5 billion. It had then said that it did not need the capital to run its business but would use it to cover a tax bill and to provide liquidity to employees.

They are working on a treatment for vitiglio (I'm confident it will work) and stroke (unsure) which are much bigger markets. By now I had expected that big Pharma would have bought them out years ago but it hasn't happened and at this stage their is a large change current management will do something dumb with the cash on hand, hence I'm thinking of trimming my position because the stock has been going nowhere for years...

1b24tan,stocks,Reddit's IPO - The most important details & red flags,"It has been a while since there was an exciting IPO, but finally, there is one. 

I went through the Reddit prospectus, and here's my summary of Reddit as a company, the IPO, and some of the red flags I saw.

&#x200B;

The post will be divided into the following segments:

**- Current business model**

\- **Future business model**

\- **Analysis of financial statements**

\- **Why IPO?**

**- The IPO strategy**

**- Sam Altman**

**- Valuation**

&#x200B;

**Current business model**

Reddit's primary revenue source is - advertising. In 2023, it accounted for 98% of the $804 million in revenue. The remaining 2% comes from Reddit premium subscriptions, as well as products within the user economy (Reddit Gold / Avatars).

Given the significance of the advertising revenue stream, let's focus on that. The simple formula that can be derived is: **Number of users** multiplied by **Average revenue per user**. 

These are the two most important numbers that any investor needs to focus on when analyzing almost any advertising business.

Let's start with the number of users. In an ideal world, we should know the exact number of users, and divide that with the potential user size. This will allow us to calculate the so-called ""penetration rate"". So, if the penetration rate is 10% for example, it indicates that the company has plenty of room to grow.

Reddit discloses two metrics: DAUq (Daily active uniques) and WAUq (Weekly active uniques). This could be seen as the first red flag. Here's why:

If we define the market size as users who are above the age of 14, that's over 270 million in the U.S.

The U.S. daily active uniques are 36 million. Hence, if we use these metrics, the penetration rate is about **13%**.

However, if we use the weekly active uniques, we get to a penetration rate of almost **50%** (131 million WAUq).

So, which one is it?

I'll argue that even the 50% is understated. Why? Because first of all, not everyone will be on Reddit, just as not everyone will be on any other platform. Second of all, there are users who use Reddit once every few months, when they need someone's advice or opinion. These, once in a while users are not taken into these metrics.

In theory, the company can innovate, and bring new features, that attract more users, and the average time spent per user increases. Given that the platform doesn't change too much over time, I'll argue that the platform applies only to a certain type of user and is getting close to the ceiling when it comes to growing within the U.S.

Internationally, on the other side, there is plenty of room to grow. However, as George Orwell said, ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others"".

This brings us to the 2nd part of the equation - average revenue per user.

The average U.S. user brings 4x more revenue than the average user from the rest of the world. So, although there is room to grow, it is less valuable.

&#x200B;

**Future business model**

This is a good short summary of Reddit's main income stream, but it is backward-looking, and there is one more thing that we need to take into account. Its data.

It is fair to say that the platform is one of the internet's largest archives of human experiences and conversations, and this data definitely has value. It can be used for various reasons, including, training large language models. Pretty much the same day as filing the prospectus, Reddit and Google announced a partnership, that is expected to be worth $60 million per year. This is 8% of its 2023 revenue and I believe this revenue stream - licensing data - is what will create all the hype around the company. 

Here's why I think that:

&#x200B;

**Analysis of financial statements**

Despite being around for 19 years, Reddit is still struggling to find its way to profitability and loses around $100m per year. It can be argued that the company is poorly managed, and it reminds me of Twitter prior to the acquisition of Elon Musk, when the R&D was incredibly high and couldn't be justified with the new features introduced by the platform.

Reddit's R&D for 2023 was $438 million (55% of revenue). Of course, this is lagging, as in many cases, the value created from it is somewhere in the future. However, this isn't something new. Reddit has historically had high R&D expenses. Whether this is justified or not, of course, you be the judge.

Its revenue growth in 2023 was 20%, which isn't too exciting and can be barely labeled as a growth company. Especially considering there's not much room to grow in the U.S. and its international growth is less valuable.

&#x200B;

The expectation is that the valuation will be above $5 billion. The company has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt apart from leases. Meaning, that the valuation of the business is above $3.8 billion. 

I'd argue with the current business model and lack of profitability, this cannot be justified. Its future value is highly dependent on the success of data licensing, a revenue stream, that we have very little information on.

&#x200B;

**Why IPO?**

However, the question ""Why IPO?"" has not been answered yet. The company is losing $100m per year and has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is sufficient to cover the losses for the foreseeable future. So, raising additional funds doesn't seem to be the main reason for the IPO.

Two reasons should be considered:

1. **Liquidity for the existing shareholders** \-  However, if the existing shareholders are pushing for this, it means they're not too optimistic about the company's future.
2. Executive compensation - The CEO, for example, has over 660k PRSUs (Performance-restricted share units) that are eligible to vest when the company attains a $5b market cap valuation.

In my opinion, if the current shareholders believe in the company, they would be better off if the company remained private. So far, I am not convinced that the IPO adds any value to the company.

Being a public company brings quite some costs. The list of all costs, that is disclosed in the prospectus is yet to be completed, and there are also going to be additional ongoing expenses for being a public company, that will be incurred every single year.

&#x200B;

**The IPO strategy**

The price of pretty much anything is a function of supply and demand. As Reddit doesn't need additional funds, I don't expect the company will issue too many additional shares. Rumors range from raising $100m to $750m. Now, if we focus on the demand, here's another red flag.

Qualified Reddit users and moderators will be invited to buy shares in the IPO, alongside other investors, through a directed share program. In my opinion, this is a psychological trick, making the users and moderators feel special so that they use this special offer to buy shares.

In addition, there will be shares offered through Fidelity Brokerage Services, SoFi, and Robinhood. So, if someone wants to buy into an IPO, they get a chance to do that. Basically, the goal is to increase demand as much as possible.

&#x200B;

**Sam Altman**

Entities affiliated with Sam Altman have 9.2% voting power. Yes, the  OpenAI Sam Altman.

Have you seen the licensing deal between OpenAI and Reddit?  
Me neither.

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Anyway, one of the questions that many have is - Is Reddit going to be overvalued from the start? The answer to that question depends on your expectations for the data licensing model. Based on my estimates, the current advertising business model is worth around $1.7 billion.

Add the $1.2 billion of cash on top of it, and the valuation is close to $3 billion.

Of course, I could be wrong in my estimates, but it is quite clear that the advertising business doesn't explain the $5 billion + valuation.

So, is the data licensing revenue stream worth more than $2 billion? This is one of the main questions that needs to be answered. As there is no past information, it is also the key piece of the puzzle to create hype around the company. I would not be surprised if more data licensing information followed before the IPO, which further increases the hype around the company.

However, if Reddit can land many data licensing deals, then the $5 billion valuation can be justified.

&#x200B;

I'd love to read your thoughts about the IPO, your thoughts on how much the data licensing stream is worth, as well as if there is something else that you find important, that I missed.",2024-02-28 12:23:13,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656407,2 days 05:21:03.656408,182,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24tan/reddits_ipo_the_most_important_details_red_flags/
1b2k50m,stocks,"""Iger Slashes Disney Stake by 80%"" ... but did he really?","(edit: no, he really didn't. more at the bottom.)

According to this article (among others) Bob Iger sold off 80% of his shares in the past 12 months. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ceo-bob-iger-slashes-disney-stake-by-80/ar-BB1iUSR0

Allegedly going from over a million shares to 186,674 shares...

But wait.... according to the SEC filings, he has direct ownership of 166,166 shares at the end of 2022, and almost 184,260 shares in January of 2024. His indirect shares (wife and 401k) have no remarkable change either.  

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000244/xslF345X03/wf-form4_167218565155675.xml

He does seem to have drastically reduced his position across the course of 2022 but the records are confusing to me. 

He had 886,531 shares after his tax sales at the beginning of the year, but then near the end of the year -- with no recorded Form 4 transactions intervening -- he files a new Form 3 with only 150,000 shares. I didn't think he could sell without filing Form 4, but the share count certainly went down.  Maybe the Form 3 restates no longer available Form 4s, or the transactions were on some other kind of filing? Maybe they were given away and not sold (for example put into trusts for children or charity as shares, without ever being sold).


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000024/xslF345X03/wf-form4_164134884768001.xml

I have a lot of questions, but what I mostly want to know is, is this journalist misreading the data or am I? Did Iger really sell heavily in 2023-2024, and why did his share count change with little record in 2022?

(Or perhaps this article is a repost with a new date, changing it from something that *was* true at some particular point in time to something that is misleading? The specific numbers still don't make sense to me, but the broad outline would.)


Edit: It looks like he did not. Thanks to u/Puzzleheaded_War6849 who found the source of the number in a 14A filing from January 2022, and reminded me of Iger's retirement. There's no record of his sales in 2022 because he *wasn't an insider* until he was re-hired towards the end of the year, hence filing a new 'initial' declaration of holdings on November 20th, 2022.  This means that the article is using old data (whether it's a republished article or a confused journalist I don't know).  We could speculate that Iger did not trust Chapek's leadership since he was heavily selling during his time outside the company, but we cannot draw any conclusions about the current direction of Disney.

1b2adtt,stocks,"Polestar raises almost $1 billion, sees margins improving in 2024, $PSNY up 27% since Wednesday’s market open","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/polestar-raises-almost-1-billion-142243111.html

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) — Polestar said on Wednesday it had raised a $950 million loan from a bank syndicate, helping to fill a gap left when Volvo Cars said it would stop funding the electric carmaker.

New York-listed shares of the Swedish EV maker rose over 25% after the news.

Polestar also forecast double-digit gross profit margins by the end of 2024, against an expected flat outcome in 2023.

Investors' enthusiasm for EV makers has cooled as growth in EV sales has slowed and financial losses have piled up, making life especially hard for startups. Price cuts by leading players Tesla and BYD have added to the pressure.

""It is crucial for us to be able to concentrate on rolling out our car programs, and it provides the funds needed to complete the model program that we have with Polestar 2,3 and 4 this year, and the 5 joining in 2025,"" CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters.

Polestar differs from many pure-play EV startups in that it has had two strong financial backers that co-founded the company, Volvo Cars and Geely Holding.

However, it has still struggled, which has led to target misses and job cuts.

The fresh funding comes at a crucial time after Volvo said this month it would cease further funding of Polestar, and hand over most of its stake to its shareholders such as Geely.

The three-year loan facility from 12 international banks is intended to help Polestar achieve its goal of cash flow break-even in 2025. In the auto industry, a carmaker can spend $1 billion to develop a single model.

Polestar had previously said it would need $1.3 billion in external funding to break even in 2025.

Geely CEO Daniel Li, also a Polestar board member, said the Chinese automaker would continue backing Polestar.

""Geely will continue to provide full operational and financial support to the iconic performance car brand going forward,"" Li said in Polestar's statement.

""We will retain our shares in Polestar and intend to participate in future financing activities when required,"" he added. ""Polestar will have full access to technologies and engineering expertise from Geely Holding to realise its global growth targets.""

Banks extending the loan to Polestar include BNP Paribas, Natixis, Standard Chartered, BBVA, HSBC, and SPDB.

Polestar said it expected volume growth this year that would support its target for 2025 of more than 155,000 vehicles annually.

""Volume and margin progression are expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2024, as the two SUVs reach full production and global distribution,"" the company said, referring to the Polestar 3 and 4 models coming this year.

1b2jxx5,stocks,Top ex-Disney exec Kevin Mayer tipped prime contender to succeed Iger. He just headed the negotiations to merge Disney-India with Reliance.,"***Kevin Mayer***, *a prime contender in the race to succeed Bob Iger as Disney's CEO, has mapped out what he sees as the must-have traits for the next chief executive officer of the Mouse House*.

*Boasting a rich history with the entertainment behemoth dating back to 1992, Mayer’s track record is punctuated by pivotal roles in orchestrating game-changing mergers and acquisitions, including groundbreaking deals for Marvel, Pixar, and key assets of 21st Century Fox.*

*He also played a crucial role in steering the launch of Disney+, a seismic shift that reshaped the company's digital landscape. Exiting Disney in 2020 to helm short-form video platform TikTok, Mayer's tenure was cut short amidst escalating pressure from the Trump administration over the platform's ties to China, prompting his swift departure.*

*Mayer has since redirected his expertise toward the booming realms of streaming and digital content as the founder and CEO of Candle Media, boasting an impressive portfolio featuring the likes of Reese Witherspoon's media venture Hello Sunshine and global kids' entertainment titan Moonbug, home to popular franchises such as Cocomelon and Blippi.*

*Having returned to the Disney fold as a strategic advisor to Iger last year, Mayer's insights have become increasingly coveted amidst continuing speculation surrounding his old boss’s succession.*

***The 3 traits Disney's next CEO must have***

*Speaking on stage with Fortune’s Massimo Marioni at Web Summit Qatar, Mayer outlined three indispensable attributes necessary for the next occupant of one of the world’s most coveted corner offices.*

*""Bob is tough to replace. We saw that the first time around,"" acknowledged Mayer, reflecting on the turbulent tenure of Bob Chapek, who replaced Iger in 2020 before leaving in 2022.*

*""Bob \[Iger\] is an incredibly capable CEO. He knows the company inside out. He and I made those content acquisitions that really changed the face of not only Disney, but also the entertainment industry in many ways.*

*“A Disney CEO really has to understand brands. The influence and power that they have. And the responsibility that goes along with having those brands.""*

***'No one is irreplaceable'***

*Furthermore, Mayer underscored the imperative for a fusion of creativity and shrewd business acumen to navigate Disney's multifaceted operations spanning theme parks, streaming, paid TV, channels, consumer products, and sports.*

*""They have to be creative but also a substantially sophisticated businessperson. It’s a multifaceted company,"" he added.*

*Acknowledging the daunting task of filling Iger's formidable shoes, Mayer said: ""Bob's a great CEO and very difficult to replace, but no one is irreplaceable.""*

*Pressed on his potential candidacy, Mayer remained coy, quipping: ""No comment on that, but I spent a lot of time there.""*

1b24v4l,stocks,Baidu revenue grows 6% in fourth quarter as AI and advertising boost business,"China’s Baidu said fourth-quarter revenue rose 6%, helped by gains from its artificial intelligence applications and a growing advertising business.

For the three months through December, the company reported revenue of 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion), broadly in line with analysts’ average estimate of 34.97 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s adjusted net income rose by 44% to 7.76 billion yuan, compared with 5.37 billion yuan for the same period a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts for 6.32 billion yuan.

As China’s largest internet search engine, Baidu makes the majority of its revenue from advertising. But as China’s economy slows and consumers spend less, Baidu has increasingly invested in AI. In March last year, it launched its ChatGPT-like ERNIE Bot in bid to capture from the potential of the technology.

The company said ERNIE AI services have already started to contribute to Baidu’s revenues.

“Throughout 2023, we made significant strides in advancing ERNIE and ERNIE Bot, reinventing our products and services, and achieving breakthroughs in monetization.” Co-founder and CEO Robin Li said in a statement.

The U.S.-listed shares of the company rose by 0.4% in trading before the bell.

Baidu’s online marketing revenue grew 6% to 19.2 billion yuan.

For the quarter, its adjusted profit was 21.86 yuan per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with a profit of 15.25 yuan per share a year earlier.

This exceeded analysts’ average estimate of 17.87 yuan per ADS, according to LSEG.

*Disney cited nine examples where it disputed claims made by Peltz, who is attempting to gain two board seats, one for himself and another for ally and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo.*

*Disney, Peltz and another activist investor, Blackwells Capital, have roughly one month to persuade investors to back their board room directors. Each party is making its case in hopes of persuading shareholders ranging from institutions to mom and pop investors.*

*The company attacked a broad range of Peltz's arguments that ranged from the billionaire investor's track record to the financial acumen of its former CFO and Peltz ally:*

\**Among the 11 companies on which Peltz or other Trian representative held a board seat, which were cited by Peltz as having benefited from his involvement, about 68% of the cases have underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index, Disney said.*

\**Despite Trian's claims in February that it and other investors were ""caught in the Disney mousetrap,"" Disney cited a report claiming Peltz realized a $150 million profit from the sale of about one-third of his stake in the company in early 2023.*

\**Disney also rejected Trian's claims that its board would benefit from Rasulo's media and business acumen. Since joining the iHeartMedia Board as lead independent director in May 2019 the media company's stock has declined 87%, the company noted.*

*\*The company defended the performance of its global streaming services, and disputed claims that Disney had refused to engage with Peltz, noting there have been no fewer than 20 ""meaningful interactions.""*

*Disney's battle with activist investors comes at a pivotal time for Disney, as the company is trying to reinvigorate its creative franchises, make its streaming business profitable and find partners to help build ESPN's digital future. Chief Executive Bob Iger has called the activist campaigns a ""distraction.""*

*Hedge fund Blackwells Capital also has solicited investor support for its three nominees to Walt Disney's board, Craig Hatkoff, a co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival who also has a background in real estate, Jessica Schell, a former executive vice president of Warner Bros Home Entertainment, and Leah Solivan, founder and former CEO of TaskRabbit, an online marketplace for freelance labor.*

* Company is winding down work on decade-old Project Titan
* Employees on some car teams will move to Apple’s AI division

&#x200B;

[(Bloomberg)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986) \-- **Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car**, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.

But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.

The decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.

Most recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.

1b1pr1s,stocks,"Beyond Meat shares soar 80% as company tops quarterly revenue estimates, plans 'steep' cost cuts in 2024","Beyond Meat on Tuesday topped market expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on resilient demand for its faux meat patties in key markets outside the United States, and said it would ramp up its pricing actions in 2024.

The company’s shares, which fell 27.7% in 2023, jumped about 84% in extended trade on Tuesday as CEO Ethan Brown also said Beyond Meat would “steeply reduce” operating expense and cash use in the year.

About 40% of the company’s shares were short at the end of January, as per LSEG data.

To counter weak demand in the United States, Beyond Meat, which supplies its plant-based meat patties to fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Yum! Brands, has lowered prices and resorted to higher discounts.

Faux meat is pricier than traditional meat — a factor that has discouraged budget-conscious consumers in the U.S. from opting for the former in recent times.

The company has also been able to sustain demand for plant-based meat in its international markets, particularly Europe.

Cost-cut measures, including job cuts taken last year, have also helped reduce the burden on margins from sluggish demand in the United States.

Volumes rose 8% in the quarter ended Dec 31, compared to a 3.5% increase in the third quarter.

Net revenue for the fourth quarter fell 7.8% to $73.7 million, but topped analysts’ average estimate of $66.7 million, as per LSEG data.

Still, the company’s full-year net revenue forecast in the range of $315 million to $345 million was largely below market expectations of $343.8 million.

It reported a bigger-than-expected loss of 92 cents per share for the fourth quarter, compared with expectations of 88 cents.

1b2a7g3,stocks,"First Solar jumps on strong quarter, record backlog","First Solar shares jumped Wednesday after reporting another solid quarter, with the company booked solid through 2026 and an order backlog that stretches into the end of the decade.

The stock traded as much as 9% higher on the day. It was last up about 2%.

Here’s how the company did in the fourth quarter:

Net income rose 30% year over year to $349.2 million from $268.3 million

Earnings per share of $3.25 beat an LSEG estimate of $3.13

Revenue of $1.15 billion was slightly below a consensus forecast of $1.31 billion

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said the revenue miss was more than offset by strong margins of 43.3%, compared to consensus estimates of 37.7%.

First Solar has a record order backlog of 80.1 gigawatts stretching through the end of the decade with the company completely booked through the next two years.

First Solar is one of the few companies that has weathered the sharp downturn in the solar sector. While the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) has plummeted 43% over the past 12 months, First Solar is down 6.2% over the same period.

High interest rates pummeled the highly leveraged residential solar sector, but First Solar’s focus on large, utility-scale projects has insulated the company from the macroeconomic headwinds.

“We continue to believe FSLRs extended visibility into margin levels and cash flows provides a relative safe haven for investors,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse told clients in a note. JPMorgan has a price target of $226 for the stock, implying about 56% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets on the back of First Solar’s quarterly report. Deutsche sees First Solar rising to 44% to $210 per share, while Morgan Stanley is expects upside of 69% to $245 per share.

“The company message is clear and loud - solid growth ahead, with increased capacity coming online and two new US facilities being built up,” Deutsche analyst Corinne Blanchard told clients Wednesday.

“FSLR is utility exposed, and therefore we believe isolated from the current ongoing challenges for the rest of the solar space,” Blanchard wrote. “The company also has a solid balance sheet, therefore reducing macro related headwinds.”

But there are potential headwinds on the horizon with bookings expected to slow after two bumper years. CFO Alexander Bradley told analysts on the company’s earnings call that First Solar will be “highly selective” with its contracting in 2024 as U.S. presidential and congressional elections later this year create uncertainty for the renewable sector.

Analysts are worried that Republicans might seek to weaken or repeal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act if they win unified control of government.

And CEO Mark Widmar told analysts that Chinese subsidization and dumping has led to a collapse in cell and module in key international markets such as India and Europe.

Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for First Solar to $265 from $275 prior despite the company’s strong quarter. The investment bank said solar module oversupply and potential changes to U.S. tax credits are key risks for First Solar moving forward.

KEY POINTS

* The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.04% from 7.06%
* Applications to refinance a home loan were 7% lower than the previous week and were 1% lower than the same week one year ago.
* Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% lower than the same week one year ago.

*Higher mortgage rates continue to hit demand from both current homeowners and potential homebuyers.*

*Total mortgage application volume dropped 5.6% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made to account for the Presidents Day holiday.*

*The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.04% from 7.06%, with points increasing to 0.67 from 0.66 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. The rate was about a quarter percentage point higher than it was one year ago.*

*As a result, applications to refinance a home loan were 7% lower than the previous week and were 1% lower than the same week one year ago.*

*“Higher rates in recent weeks have stalled activity, and last week it dropped more for those seeking FHA and VA refinances,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist, in a release.*

*FHA and VA loans are generally used by lower-income borrowers because they have lower down payment requirements.*

*Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% lower than the same week one year ago.*

*Fratantoni noted, however, that mortgage demand from buyers looking at newly built homes jumped 19% year over year in January.*

*“This disparity continues to highlight how the lack of existing inventory is the primary constraint to increases in purchase volume. However, mortgage rates above 7% sure don’t help,” he added. Rates were in the 6% range for all of January.*

*Mortgage rates moved higher again to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The 30-year fixed is now matching the highest level since early December 2023.*

*“There were no interesting or obvious catalysts for the move, nor would we expect there to be when it comes to the level of volatility seen on almost any day of the past 2 weeks,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.*",2024-02-28 12:14:55,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656476,2 days 05:29:21.656476,35,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b24nx8/inflation_remain_flat_ahead/
1b26ofk,stocks,TJX tops earnings estimates as holiday sales jump 13%,"TJX Cos. on Wednesday said holiday sales jumped 13% as shoppers hunting for deals flocked to the off-price retailer. 

Here’s how TJX did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. $1.12 expected

Revenue: $16.41 billion vs. $16.21 billion expected

For the quarter ended February 3, the company reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $1.22 per share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding an additional week in the quarter, TJX reported earnings per share of $1.12.

Sales rose to $16.41 billion, up about 13% from $14.52 billion a year earlier. The prior-year period’s sales included one fewer week.

Shares rose slightly in pre-market trading. The company’s stock was up more than 7% year to date, as of Tuesday’s close.

TJX, which runs T.J. Maxx, Marshall’s and HomeGoods, has become the de facto leader in the off-price space for its ability to offer a wide range of premium, branded products and entice higher income shoppers who are looking for cheaper options in the face of persistent inflation. 

Over the last year, it raised its sales and profit guidance numerous times. Ahead of the holiday season, it struck a positive tone as other retailers issued cautious or disappointing guidance amid slowing demand and an uncertain economy.

During the holidays, consumers were laser-focused on finding the best deals and discounts, spending record amounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday and pulling back when promotions weren’t available. TJX was well-positioned during the period because consumers were able to shop for a wide range of gifts and at prices that tend to be lower than competitors. 

TJX’s offering has been better than usual because so many of its suppliers had high inventories throughout 2022 and 2023 and relied on the off-price retailer to help clear that gut. Now that inventories are leveling out across the industry, Wall Street will be keen to see the state of TJX’s offering and if it can sustain the growth and demand it posted over the last year. 

TJX’s guidance appears to reflect that concern. For the current quarter, it expects earnings per share of 84 cents to 86 cents, light of the higher end of Wall Street’s expectations of 82 cents to 93 cents, according to LSEG. For the full year, it expects earnings per share of $3.94 to $4.02, compared to estimates of $3.88 to $4.40.

In a research note from Jane Hali and Associates, store checks across New York, Florida, Texas and California showed “fewer notable brand names across luxury, affordable luxury and contemporary.” While inventory levels in the previous quarter were flat, some stores looked to have too much inventory and “too much clearance,” the note said.

1b1cqsv,stocks,"Sony to lay off 900 workers from PlayStation division, or 8% of unit's global workforce","Sony Interactive Entertainment on Tuesday said it will lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation unit, or 8% of its global workforce, becoming the latest technology company to announce headcount trims.

“After careful consideration and many leadership discussions over several months, it has become clear changes need to be made to continue to grow the business and develop the company,” the unit’s President and CEO Jim Ryan said in an email to employees, released publicly by the company.

He added that employees across all of the company’s regions will be impacted by the layoffs. PlayStation’s London studio will close in its entirety, with several other studios due to be affected.

The Japanese gaming giant cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Feb. 14, after it warned of lower demand. Sony at the time said that it expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending on March, trimmed from a previous forecast near 25 million consoles.

The company’s shares plunged sharply after the forecast cut announcement.

Analysts had anticipated that Sony could move to release a refreshed version of the PlayStation 5 this year, seeking to boost interest in the console.

1b26q3r,stocks,"Novavax misses quarterly estimates, but vaccine maker narrows losses as it slashes costs","Vaccine maker Novavax on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that missed Wall Street’s estimates and reiterated plans to cut costs as it fights to stay afloat. 

Still, Novavax narrowed its losses in the quarter from the same period a year ago, even as demand for the biotech company’s Covid vaccine – its only marketable product – and other products that combat the virus continue to plummet worldwide. 

Here’s what Novavax reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: $1.44 vs. a loss of 45 cents expected

Revenue: $291.3 million vs. $322 million expected

The company posted a net loss of $178.4 million, or $1.44 per share, for the quarter. That compares to a net loss of $182.2 million, or $2.28 per share, for the year-earlier quarter. 

Novavax generated fourth-quarter sales of $291.3 million, down from the $357.4 million in the year-earlier period. 

But Novavax CEO John Jacobs said the company had some revenue move from 2023 into 2024 due to the timing of some advance purchase agreements for doses of its Covid shot. 

“I wouldn’t look at it as sales that were lost ... but there’s much more of a timing element than anything else,” Jacobs told CNBC in an interview. 

Novavax expects full-year 2024 revenue to come in between $800 million and $1 billion. That forecast reflects an expected $500 million to $600 million in revenue from advanced purchase agreements and $300 million to $400 million from commercial market product sales, royalties and other revenue from the company’s “partner-related activity.” 

Analysts surveyed by LSEG expect 2024 revenue of $969.6 million. 

Novavax expects first-quarter revenue to come in at $100 million, which reflects the tail end of the current Covid vaccination season. The company previously expected $300 million in sales for the period.

Novavax reiterated its plans to slash more expenses this year as part of the global cost-cutting plan it launched last year. 

The company plans to lower its combined research and development as well as selling, general and administrative expenses to a range of $700 million to $800 million in 2024. 

Novavax already shaved down those combined expenses to $1.21 billion last year. That’s $150 million more than the company’s initial target for those expenses, Jacobs noted. Those combined expenses came in at $1.69 billion in 2022. 

The company also reduced its operating expenses in 2023 by $1.1 billion, or 41%, compared to 2022. It also cut its workforce by 30% compared to the first quarter of 2023. 

The cuts will help Novavax focus on further developing its combination vaccine targeting Covid and the flu, which it plans to launch in 2026. The company expects to start a late-stage trial on that shot in the second half of the year.

Jacobs said that combination jab will open up a market that ranges between 120 and 140 million doses a year. The company’s data suggests that a large portion of people who receive separate Covid and flu shots will convert to combination options, he added.

The results come a year after the biotech company first raised concerns about its ability to stay in business. Shares of Novavax fell more than 50% last year. 

But the stock got a huge boost last week after it eliminated what some analysts considered one of the biggest uncertainties around the company. 

On Thursday, Novavax said it will settle a bitter arbitration dispute with Gavi, a nongovernmental global vaccine organization, over a canceled Covid vaccine purchase agreement. Novavax could pay around $300 to $400 million to the organization, but the total amount may be less if Gavi decides to order more shots from the company over the next five years.

If Novavax gets to settle part of the arbitration through vaccine orders, the company will be able to set a price for those doses, Jacobs said.

“We get to set that price and it allows us to control the economics of that,” he said, adding that “it would be a quite favorable way to settle that agreement through doses and again, that helps fulfill the mission” of distributing shots more equitably in lower-income countries.

Cava reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.05 million, or 2 cents per share, swinging from a net loss of $18.85 million, or $13.72 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, were expecting the company to break even for the quarter.

The chain’s revenue soared 36% to $177.1 million, topping analysts’ expectations of $174 million. Cava’s same-store sales climbed 11.4%, crushing expectations of 5.9% growth, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For 2024, Cava is planning to open between 48 and 52 new locations. The company is forecasting same-store sales growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $86 million to $92 million.

Cava’s shares have soared 145% since its initial public offering in June. Including Tuesday’s stock move, the restaurant chain has a market value of $6.14 billion.

1b1kg1z,stocks,"Streaming to Overtake Pay TV Subscription Revenue in the U.S. This Year: it will hit $17.3 billion, topping $16.7 billion from pay TV.","***Hollywood Reporter:*** 

*Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast.*  
  
*Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. “Streaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines – with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017,” it predicts.*

*Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but “streaming’s lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up,” Ampere explained.*  
*U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firm’s projections.*  
*The ad tiers that streamers have added, from Netflix and Amazon Prime to Disney+ and the streaming services of other Hollywood giants, are one driving force of revenue. Streaming advertising revenue will pass the $9 billion mark in the U.S. this year, the Ampere study forecasts. “The introduction of cheaper ad tiers has been successful not only in increasing new subscriber growth in previously saturated markets, but also in acting as an additional revenue source for streaming services,” the firm explained. Revenue will be further “bolstered” by Amazon Prime Video’s new advertising tier launched this quarter, it highlighted.*

*“Most major streaming services in the U.S. have launched their hybrid advertising tiers, which, along with increasing clampdowns on password sharing, have been successful at reigniting growth in the streaming market,” said Rory Gooderick, senior analyst at Ampere.*  
  
*Goodrick added, “There is still a way forward for pay TV, however. Disney and Charter’s recent deal in the U.S., which gave almost 15 million Charter subscribers access to Disney+’s advertising tier, shows how the two businesses can work together to maximize streaming’s reach to domestic subscribers and highlights the importance of traditional distribution platforms as service aggregators. Longer-term contracts and the reduction in churn make this an attractive proposition for streamers, while control over the billing relationship also means there’s something in it for the pay-TV provider.”*

It's now valued at only 1.72 trillion, less than 57% of Microsoft.

Still has a really strong balance sheet, but I personally have been critical of Google's share buy backs in the past, because although they seem big, they barely cover the share issuances to its employees and executives (most of whom are over compensated considering google has no successful projects in the last decades, outside of Youtube Premium).

1b1goet,stocks,"Warner Bros. Discovery halts merger talks with Paramount Global, sources say ","Warner Bros. Discovery has gone “pencils down” on a potential acquisition of Paramount Global, halting talks after several months of kicking the tires on merging the media companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

Skydance Media, the film and TV studio run by David Ellison, is still performing due diligence on a potential transaction, two of the people said.

Paramount Global has set up a special committee, which has hired its own financial adviser, to sift through potential bids for the whole company or certain assets. Media mogul Byron Allen offered $14 billion for the company last month, though he has a history of bidding on and not buying large media assets.

Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, isn’t interested in acquiring Paramount Global assets, one of the people said. Comcast has been working with house bankers to explore a potential commercial partnership with Paramount Global, according to people familiar with the matter.

That could include bundling or merging streaming services Peacock and Paramount+, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, or a different arrangement. Still, it’s unclear if Paramount Global would have interest in this as it explores sale scenarios.

Spokespeople for Comcast, Paramount Global, Skydance Media and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.

Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav had a preliminary conversation with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, CNBC reported in December. The companies engaged in more serious merger discussions in January, but talks have cooled off this month.

Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell 10% Friday after the company missed analyst targets for earnings and revenue. Shares have fallen 47% in the past year and are near a 52-week low.

Paramount Global is also trading close to a 52-week low as it prepares to announce its earnings Wednesday.

1b28bbz,stocks,"Might be a silly question, but how does one actually make money off investing if you never sell your stocks?","I'm in my 20s and I've been slowly building up my portfolio over the past few years, and I now have around $100K through DCA and unrealized profits over time. I only invest in companies that I'm confident in long-term, and I've never sold any shares. My plan is to just buy and hold. I have no doubt that if I keep investing regularly, I'll become a millionaire in my forties or fifties. However, this would only be on paper.  So even if my portfolio does hit $1M, doesn't that mean in terms of actual spending power I'll be no better off than I am today unless I sell all my shares? I won't actually be able to buy anything with my $1M portfolio unless I sell any shares. Of course one might argue that I could just take some small profits by selling 5% of my positions in a stock that's gone up by a lot for example. But I would counter that unless I invested a ridiculously large sum of money, selling 5% of a position will not make me 'rich'. For example if my portfolio grows to $1M and I want to buy a house for $1M, I'll have to sell off all my shares and I'll have to start from scratch again. Given the amount of time and effort it would take to grow a portfolio from zero to $1M from scratch, this hardly seems like a feasible solution.

1b1g2q3,stocks,Chip stock bubble ,"
I keep hearing about the chip stock AI induced bubble.

Stock prices and market cap of these stocks have shot up quickly to the stratosphere, so I understand the bubble concern. 

However, the valuation stocks like NVIDIA really doesn't seem outrageous based on earnings and predicted future earnings and the speed in which earnings are growing. 

Question:
Is because people believe these projected future earnings are way off?  Or because demand will eventually dry up and the stocks come cratering back to reality? 

What is the Bear vs bill argument on stocks like NVIDIA? 

I own a little NVIDIA and Broadcom, but I have basically been on the sideline while AI has taken over the world. I was shocked when I looked at current and future P/E and it wasn't quite as insane and the Bubble Bear news would suggest, despite its rapid climb.

1b1crxj,stocks,"Lowe's beats earnings estimates as sales fall, company expects 2024 revenue to fall","Lowe’s on Tuesday beat Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, even as the company continued to see customers tackle fewer home projects.

The home improvement chain was going up against lower expectations for its fourth quarter. It had cut its full-year forecast in November, after CEO Marvin Ellison said the company had felt a “greater-than-expected pullback” on pricier items and discretionary home projects.

Lowe’s said it factored economic uncertainty into its forecast for the current fiscal year, too. It said it expects total sales of between $84 billion and $85 billion, which would be a drop from $86.38 billion in fiscal 2023. It anticipates comparable sales will decline between 2% and 3% compared with the prior year, and expects earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30.

Here’s what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.77 vs. $1.68 expected

Revenue: $18.60 billion vs. $18.45 billion expected

The company’s net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 2 was $1.02 billion, or $1.77 per share, compared with $957 million, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the costs associated with Lowe’s sale of its Canadian retail business, earnings per share were $2.28.

Sales fell from $22.45 billion in the year-ago period. The company said its prior-year quarter included an additional week and sales from its Canadian business.

Comparable sales dropped by 6.2% year over year, as the home improvement retailer saw weaker demand for do-it-yourself projects and poor weather in January. Comparable sales for home professionals, a category that includes plumbers, electricians and contractors, were flat year over year in the quarter, however.

During the fourth quarter, Lowe’s spent $404 million on share buybacks and paid $633 million in dividends.

As of Monday’s close, Lowe’s shares were up nearly 4% this year. That trails the approximately 6% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. Shares of Lowe’s closed at $231.32 on Monday, bringing the company’s market value to about $133 billion.

Rival Home Depot last week beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations, but its sales fell year over year and the retailer’s leaders described the past year as one of “moderation” after unusually high demand during the pandemic. The company also said customers were continuing to put off bigger projects because of higher interest rates.

1b1i87o,stocks,Reddit Files S1 for IPO,"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…

  
\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

  
\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

  
\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”

  
\- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe).

  
I think there is a lot to be excited about, but also a lot of unknowns as Reddit moves to this next growth chapter.",2024-02-27 17:54:36,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656586,2 days 23:49:40.656586,22,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b1i87o/reddit_files_s1_for_ipo/
1b1i5rt,stocks,Norwegian Cruise Line reports first profitable year since 2019,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings on Tuesday reported its first profitable year since 2019 as fourth-quarter losses narrowed dramatically.

The cruise company reported strong growth and ticket demand with an encouraging 2024 forecast. Shares of the company surged 17% following the report.

Here’s how Norwegian performed in the fourth quarter compared with estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Loss per share: 18 cents vs. 14 cents expected

Revenue: $1.99 billion vs. $1.97 billion expected

For the last three months of 2023, Norwegian reported a net loss of $106.5 million, an improvement from a loss of $482.5 million in the year-ago period. The company’s loss per share narrowed to 25 cents from $1.14 the prior year. Adjusting for one-time items, Norwegian reported a loss per share of 18 cents.

For the full year, the company generated total revenue of $8.55 billion, a 32% increase from 2019, with a net income of $166.2 million. In 2022, Norwegian lost $2.27 billion.

The company saw 102.9% occupancy for the year. Total revenue per passenger per day increased 17% from pre-pandemic levels.

The company said it received robust demand for most of its cruises except those traveling through the Middle East, which were canceled due to the violence in Gaza. The cancellations only caused a slight dip in occupancy in the fourth quarter to 99.2%, the company said.

“Norwegian Cruise Line Holding experienced a momentous year of growth and achievement in 2023,” CEO Harry Sommer said in a statement. “We successfully took delivery of three new ships, one for each of our brands, representing the most deliveries in a single year in our Company’s 57-year history. This important milestone showcases our dedication to innovation and commitment to providing exceptional vacation experiences for our guests.”

The company said it’s currently at record-high booking levels due to “healthy consumer demand” across the fourth quarter and full year.

For the full year 2024, the company expects an adjusted profit of about $635 million, or $1.23 per share, and an occupancy rate of about 105%. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated 2024 earnings per share of $1.21.

Shares of other cruise companies, including Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corp., also rose Tuesday morning.

1b113lx,stocks,Unity shares sink on weak guidance,"Unity Software shares plummeted 17% in extended trading on Monday after the gaming software company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings per share: Loss of 66 cents. The results may not be comparable to the 46 cent loss predicted by analysts according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv

Revenue: $609 million vs. $596 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG

Unity said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings of $45 million to $50 million, below the $113 million that analysts were expecting.

The company said going forward, it would only provide revenue guidance for its “strategic portfolio,” which includes its engine, cloud and monetization business units. Unity said in January that it would cut 1,800 jobs as part of a corporate restructuring plan that included ending efforts deemed to be “non-strategic,” such as professional services and the Luna marketing business.

The company said first-quarter guidance for its strategic portfolio would come in between $415 million and $420 million. Analysts were expecting total first-quarter revenue of $534 million.

“We are right sizing our cost structure to grow from a healthy financial position,” Unity said in a shareholder letter. “This includes the previously announced reduction of approximately 25% of our workforce, in addition to cloud hosting cost savings, office footprint consolidation, and software license optimization.”

Unity said fourth-quarter revenue jumped 35% from $451 million a year earlier, while its net loss narrowed to $254 million from close to $288 million a year ago.

In October, John Riccitiello retired as Unity’s CEO and was replaced by former Red Hat chief James Whitehurst as interim CEO. Riccitiello’s departure came shortly after Unity announced a pricing change that upset several video game developers.

“We are committed to increasing shareholder value through revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow generation and we believe that the steps we have taken in the past few months position us for success in 2024 and beyond,” Unity said in its shareholder letter.

1b186uq,stocks,How do you fight the “I should have”?,"I’m still a newbie in investing, only been doing it for 4 years, and in the beginning it was a mess, frequently replacing my stocks because of rumors, or sold everything on “crash is coming” news. Now I’m much more calm, I survived -30% (solar) without quitting, and now up 25%.
Even though I’m much more rational, “I should have bought more NVDA” always comes back.
For 5 years I’ve been working with AI/ML in depth, with bare models, and even then (when ChatGPT was nowhere, and AI was a gimmick) I knew this is capable of anything. But I didn’t invest enough in it being a newbie, and listen to analysts who probably knew nothing about how AI is working and the potential in it (at least learnt that analysts opinions are just worthless).
Now 14% of my portfolio is NVDA (definitely the main driver of my portfolio), but I still feel like I will regret it not having more in it.
I know 14% is already not “diversified enough”, but it’s more rational than listening to my guts (would raise that 14% to 30% at least).
I know that this “should have” can go either way though.
When I had 40% of my portfolio in solar, for almost 2 years going down every single week was very hard to swallow, and then I said “I should have” bought less.
Every time I have this, I realise the only thing that can really help is diversifying, but it’s hard to silence gut feelings, and be completely rational.

1b1ctk9,stocks,Macy’s posts another quarter of falling sales as it unveils strategy to get back to growth,"Macy’s on Tuesday said sales fell nearly 2% in the holiday quarter, as the 166-year-old department store operator unveiled its strategy to get back to growth. 

Here’s what Macy’s reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.45 adjusted vs. $1.96 expected
Revenue: $8.12 billion vs. $8.15 billion expected
The retailer said it expects sales to remain stagnant. It projected net sales of between $22.2 billion to $22.9 billion for this fiscal year, down from $23.09 billion in 2023. It anticipates comparable sales, which take out the impact of store openings and closures, will range from a decline of about 1.5% to a gain of 1.5% compared with the year-ago period on an owned-plus-licensed basis and including third-party marketplace sales.

Yet the company’s new CEO Tony Spring laid out a brighter outlook for the following fiscal year and how Macy’s plans to get there. Spring is the former CEO of Macy’s higher-end department store Bloomingdale’s. He took the helm earlier this month, weeks after Macy’s announced layoffs and as it faced pressure from activist investors.

In an interview with CNBC, he said the company is taking a clear-eyed look at its business — particularly its struggling namesake stores.

“Yes, there are headwinds, certainly on discretionary categories and the middle-income consumer, but we take responsibility for what we control,” he said. “Let’s put better products into our stores. Let’s make sure it’s merchandised appropriately at a decent value. And then we have more opportunity for conversion and more [market] share.”

As part of the retailer’s push to woo shoppers and restore investor confidence, Macy’s said it will make big changes to its store footprint. Macy’s plans to close about 150 unproductive locations and to prioritize investing in about 350 other namesake locations.

It plans to focus more on selling luxury goods by opening about 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and at least 30 new Bluemercury stores over the next three years. It will also remodel roughly 30 existing stores of the beauty chain during that time. 

Macy’s had already announced five store closures and more than 2,300 layoffs last month. It also said last year that it would open up to 30 smaller versions of its namesake stores in strip malls over the next two years.

In a news release on Tuesday, Macy’s said it will also take a hard look at how to operate more efficiently – such as scrutinizing the network of warehouses used for its e-commerce business.

In the fiscal year that starts in early 2025, Macy’s said it expects low-single digit comparable sales growth on an annual basis, including owned, licensed and marketplace sales. It said it expects capital spending to fall below 2024 levels and free cash flow to drop to pre-pandemic levels. Its outlook does not include any potential impact from a proposed credit card late fee ruling by the federal government. 

Macy’s, which includes its namesake banner, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, has faced scrutiny from activist investors Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who made a rejected bid to buy the retailer. Arkhouse recently nominated a slate of nine directors to Macy’s board.

For the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 4, Macy’s swung to a loss of $71 billion, or 26 cents per share, from net income of $508 million, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. The losses included $1 billion of impairment and restructuring costs related to Macy’s plans to close about 150 locations, which are part of its turnaround strategy.

Revenue fell from $8.26 billion in the year-ago period. Digital sales declined 4% compared to the prior-year quarter and brick-and-mortar sales were roughly flat.

Across the company, comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis fell 4.2% from the year-ago period. That was better than the 5.8% decline that analysts expected, according to LSEG.

Macy’s continued to be the weakest store banner – a trend reflected in the company’s plans to close many of its stores. The namesake store’s comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis dropped by 4.7%, as the women’s shoes and cold weather apparel and accessories categories struggled. Beauty and Macy’s off-price business, Backstage, were stronger performers in the quarter. 

Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, the two store chains that the parent company plans to expand, both fared better in the holiday quarter. 

At Bloomingdale’s, comparable sales declined 1.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, as the men’s and designer handbag businesses came in soft.

Bluemercury’s comparable sales rose 2.3%, as shoppers bought skincare items and color cosmetics. 

Net credit card revenue also took a hit, as Macy’s said it tumbled by 26% from the prior year to $195 million as the company dealt with higher net credit card losses. 

So far this year, shares of Macy’s have fallen about 4%. The company’s stock has underperformed the approximately 6% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. Shares of Macy’s closed Monday at $19.30, bringing the company’s market value to $5.29 billion.

1b0lmjg,stocks,Elon Musk says Rivian needs to ‘cut costs massively’ and its execs should ‘live in the factory’ or the Tesla rival will die,"Elon Musk is not surprised by the bad news hitting Tesla rival Rivian. He’s been warning about it for some time.

On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%.

Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, “Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.”

“They need to cut costs massively and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,” he wrote.

Musk, having gone through “production hell” and “sleeping at the factory” himself at Tesla, should know.

The billionaire has warned about Rivian’s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be “to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they’re doomed.”

1b118hg,stocks,Zoom shares jump as quarterly results beat on top and bottom lines,"Zoom shares rose as much as 13% in extended trading on Monday after the video chat software vendor announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations.

Here’s how the company did, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.22 adjusted vs. $1.15 expected

Revenue: $1.15 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected

Revenue increased less than 3% from $1.12 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $298.8 million, or 98 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Jan. 31, compared with a net loss of $104.1 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Far from its heyday during the Covid-19 pandemic, when a surge in the number of remote workers sent revenue up over 100% for five straight quarters, Zoom is now mired in single-digit growth.

Growth would have been faster in the fiscal fourth quarter if not for a sales reorganization. It “took a lot of time for the organization to recover from, frankly,” Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts.

At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom had 220,400 enterprise customers, up from 219,700 at the end of the prior quarter.

Zoom’s Team Chat migration tool “has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months,” Eric Yuan, the company’s founder and CEO, said during the call. He said Zoom hasn’t done a great job of marketing its chat capabilities.

For the fiscal first quarter, Zoom called for $1.18 to $1.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.125 billion in revenue, which would represent growth of less than 2% from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $1.13 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.13 billion in revenue.

For the 2025 fiscal year, Zoom sees $4.85 to $4.88 in adjusted earnings per share, with $4.60 billion in revenue, implying 1.6% revenue growth. The LSEG consensus was adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share and revenue of $4.65 billion.

Before the jump, Zoom shares were down 12% so far this year, while the S&P 500 stock index had gained 6% during the same period.

1b0n2q0,stocks,"FTC sues to block Kroger, Albertsons merger over price and wage concerns","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is suing to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, saying the combination of the two major grocers would result in higher prices for shoppers and lower wages for workers.

In a release, the FTC said it issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to stop Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, which would create one of the largest grocers in the country. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general have joined the court complaint, including those from Arizona, California, Washington D.C., Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming.

“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.”

Kroger said in a statement that blocking the deal “will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America’s consumers and workers.”

 “The FTC’s decision makes it more likely that America’s consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts,” the company said in a statement.

It added that the decision “strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry.”

Kroger and Albertsons’ agreement has been stuck in a holding pattern for more than a year while federal and state regulators scrutinize the merger. The companies announced the proposed deal in October 2022, and said by teaming up, the grocers would be able to better compete with larger retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco.

The FTC argued the supermarket merger would harm shoppers and workers at a time when the price of food and many everyday items has risen. The Biden administration has been skeptical of a range of mergers, and the White House has made consumer protection a key issue as President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection this fall.

Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen has made the company’s case for the tie-up, saying as a larger supermarket operator, the combined companies would be able to lower prices, boost profitability and speed up innovation in the grocery industry. The company also pledged $500 million to reduce prices for customers and $1 billion to raise employee wages and expand benefits.

Yet the deal has faced stiff resistance and new complications after a period of historic inflation. Two unions that represent Kroger and Albertsons employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters union, opposed the deal.

Higher prices of everyday food items fueled worries that a bigger company would have too much pricing power — concerns some politicians have echoed.

Higher grocery prices have irked consumers and become a hot topic on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, grocery chains drew the ire of Biden, who accused companies of ripping off shoppers while keeping profit margins high.

Together, Kroger and Albertsons would be a mammoth company and tighten a market share gap with Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S. Kroger and Albertsons also compete with regional players like Publix and Wegmans, and discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe’s.

Combined, the grocers would have about 5,000 stores across the U.S. The deal would marry Kroger’s approximately two dozen supermarket banners, including its namesake stores, Fred Meyer, and Ralphs with Albertsons’ grocery chains, including Safeway, Acme and Tom Thumb.

In an effort to overcome antitrust concerns, Kroger announced last year that it planned to sell more than 400 stores to Piggly Wiggly owner C&S Wholesale Grocers, along with other assets like distribution centers and some private brands.

But the FTC complaint said that the proposed divestiture isn’t enough. It would create “a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands and other assets” that wouldn’t be a true rival to the combined Kroger and Albertsons, the federal agency said in a release Monday.

The FTC contended the combined Kroger and Albertsons would have less reason to improve the customer experience. The federal agency said competition between the supermarkets has contributed to fresher produce, better private label offerings and services that shoppers appreciate, such as flexible pharmacy hours and curbside pickup.

The FTC also argued the deal would leave workers with less negotiating power, since employees wouldn’t have as many potential grocery employers. In some markets like Denver, the combined supermarket operator would be the only employer of unionized grocery workers, the agency said.

As some news outlets reported last week that the FTC would soon sue to block the merger, a Kroger spokeswoman said the company was still in discussions with FTC and state regulators.

The company reiterated its argument that the merger would benefit grocery shoppers and workers.

“Blocking the combination will only embolden large, non-unionized retailers – like Walmart, Amazon and Costco – to continue opposing unions and leaving communities,” the company said in a statement last week. “Kroger will continue to lower prices, grow good-paying union jobs and increase access to fresh food for the families who need it most.”

Kroger shares were trading about 1% lower Monday afternoon, while Albertsons stock was slightly higher.

But nobody is pointing out the biggest issues with this company as whole and their business model - It's all based on **free** labour.

Like them or not, but the Mods are currently the only thing keeping Reddit operational and above the water surface, they're actually working for reddit, and they're not even being paid for that!  Now as it is right now, this is not an issue since, like i said before, it's free labour.

1b1euc1,stocks,Thoughts on CPRI,"Back in August 2023, CPRI and TPR announced TPR’s takeover of CPRI for $57/share. The stock price initially jumped up to ~$54/share and has been in slow decline since then. It currently sits around ~$46. Part of this fall is due to the FTC’s second request for information for HSR purposes. 

Given that most expect this deal to close this year and, if it does, the current price provides for a potential ~25% upside, it seems the risk is worth the reward. 

It’s hard to imagine the FTC blocking this deal given that (1) the combined company would have roughly ~5% of the market, (2) the luxury handbag market is not one that requires strict consumer protection, and (3) the FTC seems to have its sights more focused on breaking up big tech, blocking any big oil mergers, and halting any large grocery store chain combinations.

1b1152x,stocks,Altice USA shares spike 36% on report Charter is considering acquisition,"Altice USA shares spiked 36% on Monday following a report that Charter Communications is considering buying the broadband company.

Charter is working with financial advisors as it considers whether it would make sense to buy Altice USA, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Altice hasn’t been approached by Charter to begin talks on a possible transaction, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The larger company’s shares dropped about 2% on Monday.

Charter declined to comment on the report, while Altice USA could not immediately be reached for comment.

The deal would bring significant consolidation at a time when major communications companies struggle to keep broadband and cable subscribers. Altice USA shares had plunged more than 40% this year before their jump Monday, while Charter’s stock has fallen about 25%.

Altice USA owns brands led by broadband, TV and phone company Optimum. The company has about five million customers.

Charter easily trumps its size with 32 million broadband and cable subscribers.

Please discuss.

&#x200B;

>Everywhere you look, stockmarkets are breaking records. American equities, as measured by the s&p 500 index, hit their first all-time high in more than two years in January, surged above 5,000 points in February and roared well above that level on February 22nd when Nvidia, a maker of hardware essential for artificial intelligence (ai), released spectacular results. The same day, Europe’s stoxx 600 set its own record. Even before Nvidia’s results had been announced, Japan’s Nikkei 225 had surpassed its previous best, set in 1989. Little surprise, then, that a widely watched global stockmarket index recently hit an all-time high, too (see chart 1).  
This is quite a turnaround. Stocks slumped in 2022, when faced with fast-rising interest rates, and wobbled last March, during a banking panic. Now, though, both episodes look like brief interruptions in equities’ long march higher. Despite middling economic growth and the covid-19 pandemic, stockmarkets have offered annual returns, after inflation, of more than 8% a year since 2010, including dividends (cash payments to shareholders, funded by company profits) and capital gains (when the price of a share increases). These returns have been better than those produced by bonds and housing. Indeed, they have been better than those produced by just about any other asset class.  
If the boom has a home, it is America. A hundred dollars invested in the s&p 500 on January 1st 2010 is now worth $600 (or $430 at 2010’s prices). However you measure them, American returns have outclassed those elsewhere. Almost 60% of Americans now report owning stocks, the most since reliable data began to be collected in the late 1980s. Many of them, as well as many professional investors, have a question. Is the stockmarket surge sustainable or the prelude to a correction?  
For as long as stockmarkets have existed there have been those predicting an imminent crash. But today, in addition to the usual doomsaying, a chorus of academics and market researchers argues that it will be tough for American firms to deliver what is required over the long-term to reproduce the extraordinary stockmarket returns seen in recent years. Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve has written about the “end of an era”, and warned of “significantly lower profit growth and stock returns in the future”. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has suggested that the “tailwinds of the last 30 years are unlikely to provide much boost in the coming years”. Jordan Brooks of aqr Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund, has concluded that “a repeat of the past decade’s equity market performance would require a heroic set of assumptions.”  
That is, in part, because valuations are already at eye-popping levels. The most closely followed measure of them was devised by Robert Shiller of Yale University. It compares prices with inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous decade—a long enough period to smooth out the economic cycle. The resulting cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or cape, has never been higher than 44.2, a record reached in 1999, during the dotcom bubble. The previous peak was in 1929, when the cape hit 31.5. It now stands at 34.3 (see chart 2).  
Rarely have corporate profits been valued so highly. And the outlook for the profits themselves is also challenging. To understand why, consider the fundamental sources of their recent growth. We have employed Mr Smolyansky’s methodology to examine national-accounts data for American corporations. Between 1962 and 1989 net profits increased in real terms by 2% a year. After that, profits accelerated. Between 1989 and 2019 they increased by more than 4% a year. We find similar trends across the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries. As a share of gdp, corporate profits were steady from the 1970s to the 1990s, then doubled (see chart 3).  
Market of mirrors  
Yet much of this strong performance is, in a sense, a mirage. Politicians have reduced the tax burden facing corporations: from 1989 to 2019 the effective corporation-tax rate on American firms dropped by three-fifths. Since companies were giving less money to the state, corporate profits rose, leaving them with more money to pass on to shareholders. Meanwhile, over the same period borrowing became cheaper. From 1989 to 2019 the average interest rate facing American corporations fell by two-thirds.  
Mirroring Mr Smolyansky, we find that in America the difference in profit growth during the 1962-1989 period and the 1989-2019 period is “entirely due to the decline in interest and corporate-tax rates”. Extending this analysis to the rich world as a whole, we find similar trends. The surge in net profits is really an artefact of lower taxes and interest bills. Measures of underlying profits have grown less impressively.  
Now companies face a serious problem. The decades-long slide in interest rates has reversed. Risk-free interest rates across the rich world are about twice as high as they were in 2019. There is no guarantee that they will fall back to these lows—let alone decline fairly steadily, as they tended to in the decades before the pandemic.  
As for taxes, the political winds have changed. True, Donald Trump may see fit to cut America’s corporation-tax rate if he wins in November. But our analysis of 142 countries finds that in 2022 and 2023 the median statutory corporate-tax rate rose for the first time in decades. For instance, in 2023 Britain increased its main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Governments have also established a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15% on large multinational enterprises. Once it has bedded in, such companies will probably pay between 6.5% and 8.1% more tax, leaving a smaller pool of net profits.  
What needs to happen, then, for American stocks to keep offering exceptional returns? One possibility is that investors pay for even more stretched valuations. In a world in which interest and tax bills remain constant for the next decade while real earnings grow at 6% a year—an optimistic scenario—America’s cape would need to rise to 51 to reproduce the overall returns seen from 2013 to 2023. That would be higher than it has ever gone before.  
Now make things grimmer and assume that valuations revert towards their means. The cape drifts towards 27, near the average since the end of the dotcom bubble. Assume, too, that interest and tax bills rise. Rather than clocking in at 25% of earnings, they drift up to 35%, or around the level in the first half of the 2010s. In this more realistic world, to generate even half the returns equity investors enjoyed since 2010, real earnings would have to grow at 9% per year. Only twice in the post-war period has America achieved this sort of growth, according to Mr Brooks, and in both cases the economy was rebounding from busts—once from the dotcom bubble and once from the global financial crisis of 2007-09.  
Many investors hope that ai will ride to the rescue. Surveys of chief executives suggest great enthusiasm for tools that rely on the technology. Some companies are already adopting them, and claim that they are producing transformative productivity gains. If deployed more widely, the tools may allow companies to cut costs and produce more value, juicing economic growth and corporate profits.  
Play the fool  
Needless to say, this is a heavy burden for a technology that is still nascent. Moreover, technological developments are far from the only trend that will affect business in the coming years. Firms face an uncertain geopolitical climate, with global trade flat or declining depending on the measure. In America both parties are sceptical of big business. The battle against inflation is also not yet won: interest rates may not fall as far or as fast as investors expect. In recent decades you would have been foolish to bet against stockmarkets, and timing a downturn is almost impossible. But the corporate world is about to face an almighty test.

1b0es64,stocks,How Japan’s Nikkei 225 Got Its Mojo Back,"  
Japan's two main indexes, i.e. Nikkei 225 and TOPIX, have outperformed S&P500 since January 2023.

Which market will reach its peak first?

  
\--------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
**How Japan’s Nikkei 225 Got Its Mojo Back**  
[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-japan-nikkei-225-records-historic-high](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-japan-nikkei-225-records-historic-high)

  
*Japanese stocks have reclaimed the historic peak reached over 34 years ago as global investors pour money into a country they’re betting has finally escaped deflation and is headed on a path of sustainable growth.*  
*On Thursday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 39,098.68, finally breaching the previous record. The leap was driven by gains in technology shares and chip-gear producers after Nvidia’s blowout sales forecast. The epic come-back — it took even longer than Wall Street’s recovery from the crash that sparked the Great Depression — marks a rebirth for Japan’s share market.*  
*Back then, the nation’s equities had risen so far and so fast that there really was only one way to go: down. “1989 was very likely the biggest bubble in human history,” said Nicholas Smith, strategist at CLSA Securities Japan Co.*  
*Today, despite some lingering concerns the rally may be a false dawn, most analysts and investors believe that the stock market is on much firmer ground. A more shareholder-friendly corporate culture has taken hold and steady gains in Japan look appealing to funds that have been burned by turmoil in markets like China.*  
  
*One of the key catalysts for the rebound is that signs of inflation — and the country’s anticipated exit from negative rates later this year — are encouraging companies to put their piles of cash to work on expanding and improving their business.*  
*Luminary investor Warren Buffett boosted his holdings in Japan’s biggest companies, an endorsement that’s further increased the allure of Tokyo stocks. Since the start of 2024, the Nikkei has surged over 16%, beating most other major markets. The outperformance is even more striking over the past 12-months or so.*  
  
*While there are still reasons to be cautious about the rebound — skeptics suggest that funds could rapidly flow back to China if sentiment shifts and worry that the Nikkei has become a momentum play — overseas investors have mostly put these aside.*  
*They are the driving force behind the rally, accounting for almost 70% of trading in the broader Topix Prime Index of stocks, while domestic buyers have largely sat on the sidelines. Institutional investors have pared their portfolios and individual Japanese investors are flocking to the US and other markets abroad following the expansion of special tax-free accounts in January.*  
*All the while, global buyers have absorbed the selling, with their holdings rising to 30%, from less than 5% in 1989.*  
*“It took a long time for global investors to accept that Japan had changed,” said Jonathan Garner, chief Asia strategist at Morgan Stanley, which was one of the first major brokerages to predict the market’s resurgence. Now, he said, after consistent corporate earnings growth and profitability improvements, there is greater agreement overseas that “Japan is in a secular bull market.*  
  
*In another sign of the great changes over the past three-plus decades, in 1989 Japanese companies accounted for 32 of the top 50 companies by global market capitalization. Today only one Japanese company, Toyota Motor Corp., makes the global top-50 list.*  
*Back in the late 1980s, Japanese banks were the true heavyweights in the market, thanks to inflated asset prices. The market is more balanced and diverse now, with major companies including Sony Group Corp., casual clothing chain operator Fast Retailing Co., the parent company of Uniqlo, and companies that hold key positions in the vast semiconductor supply chain, such as Tokyo Electron Ltd., which has benefited from a surge in orders from China.*  
  
*Even after this year’s rally, many Japanese stocks are still at depressed levels, with 37% of Nikkei members trading below their book value. In theory, this means investors could make more money by selling off all the company’s assets than keeping it as a going concern. This is tantamount to vote of no confidence in management, but it also suggests upside potential if the business is run right.*  
*Only 3% of stocks in the S&P 500 trade below book value. For the Euro Stoxx 600, just one-fifth fall under this category. The low valuations in Japan now are a stark contrast to 1989, when asset prices were at the other extreme.*  
*All this means that some fund managers now see the possibility of substantial gains to come for the Nikkei-225.*  
*“I think it could easily go to something like 42,000,” said Richard Kaye, portfolio manager at Comgest Asset Management. Getting back to the previous historic record will have “an enormous psychological impact on Japanese investors.”*",2024-02-26 10:56:33,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656749,4 days 06:47:43.656749,20,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0es64/how_japans_nikkei_225_got_its_mojo_back/

1b0gv1s,stocks,Cautious optimism about Frontier Developments,"The stock is now worth 125 GBX while their all time high was 3,300 GBX in 2021.

Up untill 2022 the company turned a small profit of 15-20 million GBP per year. However, last year the company had a 20 million loss. As explained by the company management themselves because of an unsuccesful attempt at expanding their portfolio with games like F1 Manager.

From what I’ve seen, that game was a buggy and boring mess and way outside Frontiers zone of competency. Frontier has recently stated they will return to focus on Creative Management Simulations with games like Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo, games which have brought them moderate success in the past.
Coming back to their financial performance; their attempts to broaden their portfolio over the past few years was the reason that their expenses doubled over the past few years but Frontier got little return on that investment. Exactly the reason why the company is in it's current state.

However, with games on the horizon like Planet Zoo for the console I don’t see why this company won’t return to profitability within the next few years? And if they are able to get back to a similar cashflow to the one they had before 2023 I feel like this stock would be way underpriced.

I’m curious about your guys thoughts and opinions on the Frontier stock? Am I right to assume that when the company returns to profitability (think 10-20 million p/year) the stock would likely rise significantly in value?",2024-02-26 12:57:09,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656786,4 days 04:47:07.656786,28,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0gv1s/cautious_optimism_about_frontier_developments/

*Walt Disney and Reliance Industries have signed a binding agreement to merge their media operations in India, a Bloomberg report quoted people familiar with the matter. The report said Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries is expected to own a 61% stake in the merged entity as Disney reassesses its strategy in India amid intense competition. The representatives of Disney and Reliance declined to comment on the reports of the binding merger agreement.*  
*The distribution of shares among the partners could undergo alterations based on the inclusion of Disney's additional local assets at the time of finalizing the deal, the report said. Reliance Industries is also mulling over the acquisition of Tata Play Ltd., a broadcast service provider, in which Disney holds a minority stake.*

*At present, Tata Sons holds the ownership interest, constituting 50.2% of the stakes in Tata Play while the rest of the shares are held by Disney and Temasek, an investment firm based in Singapore.*

*Inception of a media behemoth:*  
*After the completion of the merger, Disney and Reliance would create a powerful and influential media giant in one of the globe's rapidly growing entertainment markets. As per the reports, Reliance is investing $1.5 billion for its 61% stake.*  
  
*The merger comes after some critical years for Disney as the fortunes of the US entertainment giant turned after Reliance became its direct competitor in the OTT space. The two giants fought hard for the sports right but in 2022, Mukesh Ambani's unit successfully outpaced Disney in securing streaming rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament.*

1azlmvm,stocks,Thoughts on PLTR and SHOP? I don't see why they are so popular now,"I constantly hear about these two stocks for the past months. 

Analysts write articles everywhere! Popping on news feeds etc.

Given how they are discussed frequently online, I decided to take a look. Each company is taking advantage of the AI trend. PLTR using AI in their software for counter-terrorism investigations and SHOP using AI to further develop websites for individuals who wish to build an online store for marketing their product. 

Each company enjoyed a surge in 2021's pandemic / stock frenzy time but has since declined after stock correction in 2022. Both are now under pressure by investors' expectations from the AI trend's test of practicality. Seems clearcut and reasonable for the hype?

From a technical perspective, both stocks stink. A negative EPS with P/E Ratio of over 200 happening quite often. Recently, PTLR's EPS hits a positive of 0.09 and SHOP's EPS a 0.07, not impressive at the least. Their P/E Ratio is most telling with a 260 and 1011 respectively.

Yup, you are reading that correctly, a P/E ratio of over 1000... I haven't been investing for over 10 years but it is my first time seeing a 4 figure P/E ratio. 

TLDR: My conclusion? Confusion. I don't understand where the hype is and how it is justified based on the technicalities of both companies. Their finances stink and their AI potential seems more of a joining the bandwagon maneuver. 

Yet, they are so popular! PLTR has over a 50B market cap and SHOP has over 200B market cap, which put them in a large cap! What is going on?

1aywt2g,stocks,Charlie Munger – The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway,"Warren Buffett's tribute to his dear friend and investing Titan, Charlie Munger.  Bold is Buffett's own emphasis:

>Charlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100th birthday.

>Though born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life domiciled elsewhere. Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.

>In 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.

>Three years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in buying control of Berkshire. **But**, he assured me, since I had already made the move, he would tell me how to correct my mistake.

>In what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a dime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose money I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that Charlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.

>Nevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions.

>Many years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and, repeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he continued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with us, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.

>In reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, ad I acted as the “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.

>Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never – **never** –reminded me of my mistake.

>In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire has become a great company. 

>Though I have long been in charge of the construction
crew; **Charlie** should **forever** be credited with being the architect.",2024-02-24 15:12:55,2024-03-01 17:44:16.656863,6 days 02:31:21.656863,32,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aywt2g/charlie_munger_the_architect_of_berkshire_hathaway/

If you use a hedge, like shorting a long position or buying puts, aren’t you just reversing your gains and therefore breaking even every time?

So I did manually, based on trailing PE weighted by market cap.

The only apparent overvaluation looks in the electronic technology sector, but we all know the reason (AI/GPU wave).

With the recent mass layoffs of software engineers across the entire private sector industry, in combination with the fact that more people are enlightened by Turbo Tax’s shitty business practices every year (keeping taxes hard to do by lobbying), I really think the stock will crater in the next 3-5 years.

As for why the layoffs are relevant, SWEs are having trouble finding work in the private sector- and I imagine they will start turning to public sector jobs- the IRS being one of them. The public sector will be slower to incorporate AI and that’s where the jobs will really be available in the future.

Imagine the IRS finally gets some talented SWEs and release a free tax interface that competes with Turbo Tax… Turbo Tax would be in huge trouble.

1ay60ju,stocks,Block shares surge after company announces surprise profit,"Block stock rose 20% in Friday morning trading after the payments company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on gross profit and showed strong growth in its Square and Cash App revenue.

Here’s how the company did, compared to an analyst consensus from LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 45 cents, adjusted. Not comparable to estimates.

Revenue: $5.77 billion vs. $5.70 billion expected

Block posted $2.03 billion in gross profit, up 22% from a year ago. Analysts tend to focus on gross profit as a more accurate measurement of the company’s core transactional businesses.

The company raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast to at least $2.63 billion from $2.40 billion.

Block, formerly known as Square, ended the year with 56 million monthly transacting actives for Cash App in December, with most of those customers using it for either peer-to-peer payments or the Cash App Card.

Its Cash App business reported $1.18 billion in gross profit, a 25% year-over-year rise.

The company, which is run by Jack Dorsey, said its Cash App Card has 23 million monthly actives in December, up 20%. That is more than two times the growth rate of total monthly actives.

“We believe this strategy will enable us to build the largest network in the long run, with a highly engaged customer base using Cash App as their primary banking solution,” Dorsey said in a note to shareholders.

The payments firm has focused on slimming down operations in recent months. In January, the Block CEO reportedly said in a note to staffers that the company had laid off a “large number” of workers. This followed another round of layoffs in December.

Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that the company was now below a previously set cap of 12,000 employees.

“We’re going to operate under this cap until we feel it’s holding us back, which is likely years out,” Dorsey wrote. The company recorded a $70 million charge for severance costs.

The company also took an $132 million impairment on its investment in music streaming service Tidal. Block and Dorsey have had a mixed dealmaking record. The company sold delivery service Caviar to DoorDash in 2019 in a $410 million cash-and-stock deal. It also acquired Afterpay in 2021 for $29 billion, its largest acquisition ever.

Afterpay has struggled since the deal announcement, posting successive quarters of losses throughout 2022. Dorsey said in his note to shareholders that integrating Afterpay more tightly into Cash App and using it to power Cash App’s buy-now, pay-later technology were two focuses for 2024.

Block’s strong quarterly results and full-year outlook prompted Wall Street analysts to upgrade their rating of the stock on Friday.

Wells Fargo upgraded Block to overweight and raised its price target from $65 to $95, while Seaport Research Partners upgraded the stock to a buy and also hiked its price target to $95.

“SQ’s progress over the past several months in terms of streamlining itself organizationally, sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive,” the Seaport Research Partners analysts wrote. “We think there’s more to go.”

*KEY POINTS*

* *Global markets have hit record highs as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment, but some investors have urged caution.*
* *Oliver Bäte, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks “very dangerous out there.”*
* *European markets moved higher Friday, extending positive momentum from Thursday’s session, when the Stoxx 600, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nikkei all notched record highs.*

&#x200B;

*Global markets hit record highs this week as the frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted risk sentiment and hopes of a return to economic growth. But some investors have urged caution, suggesting that high tech valuations could put the rally at risk.*

*Oliver Bäte, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks “very dangerous out there.”*

*“We are very cautious about some of the valuations in the tech sector,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Friday.*

*European markets extended gains Friday after the Stoxx 600 index closed at an all-time high in the previous session.*

*Fresh earnings out of Europe and spillover from Nvidia’s bumper revenue report in the U.S. helped push the pan-European benchmark to 495.1 on Thursday — surpassing its previous record of 494.35 in January 2022, according to data from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Germany’s DAX and the French CAC also hit record highs.*

*In Asia-Pacific, Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed at a new all-time high of 39,098.68 on Thursday, surpassing the previous record of 38,915.87 set in 1989.*

*The gains have been mirrored stateside, with U.S. stock indexes also scaling fresh all-time highs.*

*It comes amid ever-growing hype around AI innovation and the anticipated boost it could bring to the sluggish global economy.*

*Shares of Nvidia closed up 16% on Thursday after its full-year results showed revenue jumped 265% on the back of soaring demand for its AI chips. The surge boosted Nvidia’s market cap by $276 billion — the biggest one-day gain for any company on record.*

*Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told CNBC on Friday that the recent rallies pointed to AI “innovation in action on every front,” and said his company had benefited “enormously” from the tech. The comments came shortly after the bank posted an 18% increase in pretax profit and announced a $1 billion share buyback program in its full-year earnings Friday.*

*However, Philippe Ferreira, deputy head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, raised questions about how long the AI hype will continue to drive markets higher.*

*“Over the course of the year, it is likely that the overall AI theme will get a reality check at the companies’ level,” he said in notes to CNBC earlier this week. “The AI trade as we have seen it might have a little more to go, but it seems to be approaching important technical levels where some profit taking could occur.”*

*In the U.S. this week, investors piled into growth and technology stocks pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recorded its best session since February 2023, popping 2.96% to close at 16,041 on Thursday.*

*For Ferreira, “18,300 on NDX and early March could be key exit levels ahead of some material consolidation.”*

*“There is no shortage of fundamental catalysts and important reckonings could be up ahead,” he added.*

1ay2evx,stocks,Lloyds Banking To Start $2.5 Billion Buyback After Profit Beat Expectations,"Lloyds Banking Group launched a 2.0 billion pound ($2.53 billion) share buyback program after it posted better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 despite lower income and a heavier provision.

The British lender on Thursday posted pretax profit for the three months to Dec. 31 of GBP1.775 billion pounds compared with GBP1.06 billion for the same period a year earlier and with GBP1.65 billion expected by a company-compiled consensus.

The FTSE 100 listed bank's net income fell to GBP4.23 billion from GBP4.69 billion for the year-earlier period, missing consensus' GBP4.43 billion estimate. Net interest income made up GBP3.32 billion of the total, against expectations of GBP3.37 billion.

Its net interest margin--the difference between what it earns on loans and pay out on deposits--for the quarter was 2.98%, against expectations of 3.01%. For 2024, it guided for margin above 2.90%--while analysts pencil in 2.96% for the year--as the benefits from higher interest rates which boosted its top line over 2023 start to taper off.

It also sees heavier-than-expected costs for the year ahead as it guided for around GBP9.3 billion in operating expenses, up from its previous view of around GBP9.2 billion and reported GBP9.14 billion in 2023.

Lloyds Banking said that it booked a GBP450 million provision in its quarterly results for the potential impact of the Financial Conduct Authority's review into historical discretionary commission arrangements in the motor finance industry, to which the bank is exposed to through its Black Horse brand.

The board declared a final dividend of 1.84 pence, bringing the full-year payout to 2.76 pence.

1axgrww,stocks,Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT,"Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”

Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It’s the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.

Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.

The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.

Publishing giant Condé Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.

As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.

It’s also faced challenges with developers and moderators.

In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company’s decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1ay1p97,stocks,ExxonMobil oil production breakeven in Guyana?,"Couldn't extract any meaningful figure from their Feb 2024 slides.  
[https://investor.exxonmobil.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1156/exxonmobil-announces-2023-results](https://investor.exxonmobil.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1156/exxonmobil-announces-2023-results)  


Does anyone have a good sense of the breakeven levels? Using Petrobas (PBR) as a reference point i infer that it could be sub $35-$40/bl level, but not confident with my analysis.

And since it's lighter crude, easier on the refinery operators to process. Would be more logical that XOM is selling the production at a PREMIUM over certain WTI or BRENT oil benchmark.

[https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/](https://oilnow.gy/featured/just-good-guyanas-crude-oil/)

  
Following ExxonMobil’s commercial discovery at the giant Liza field in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in 2015, it was confirmed that the oil found is of ‘high quality’. The term “High Quality” is commonly used to refer to crude oil which is sweet (low sulphur content) and light (high API gravity).  This means oil which has been determined to rank higher on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Gravity Scale and determined to be of a low sulphur content.  
**This bodes well for Guyana as sweet light crude is the preferred type from which the highest value petroleum products are derived.** However, it is important to note that the price of Guyana’s crude will be dependent on more than just its quality. More on this later.

1axl48j,stocks,Rivian and Lucid shares plunge after weak EV earnings reports,"Shares of electric vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid plummeted Thursday after the companies reported disappointing results and stagnant production in their fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday.

Rivian shares plunged about 25% and Lucid’s stock sank almost 17% on Thursday.

Rivian forecast it will make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, slightly less than the 57,232 vehicles the company produced last year. Lucid said it expects to make 9,000 vehicles in 2024, about 7% more than the 8,428 vehicles it made in 2023.

Rivian’s revenue of $1.32 billion for the quarter beat Wall Street estimates, but its net loss per share of $1.36 was worse than expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. The company also announced Wednesday it would cut 10% of its workforce.

“Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on Wednesday’s earnings call.

Lucid reported lower-than-expected revenue of $157.2 million for the quarter, and its net loss of 30 cents per share was in line with estimates, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said the macroeconomic environment and higher interest rates also affected the company. He said the company has had to learn to operate in new locations, such as Saudi Arabia, with different market dynamics.

Though companies have invested billions of dollars in EVs, sales have grown more slowly than expected. EVs made up 6.9% of sales heading into December, or roughly 976,560 units, up 1.7 percentage points compared with total sales in 2022. 

Rivian and Lucid make up a fraction of EV sales compared with the industry leader, Tesla. A Cox Automotive analysis found that Rivian accounted for just over 4% of EV sales in 2023, while Lucid made up 0.5%. Tesla controlled about 55% of the market.

Shares of Rivian have dropped about 40% in the past year and have fallen 85% from their initial public offering price of $78 a share in November 2021. Lucid’s stock is down about 70% in the past year and has dropped more than 75% from its IPO price of $14 a share in October 2021.

Rivian and Lucid weren’t the only EV producers Wall Street was watching Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola reported worse-than-expected revenue and a slightly better-than-expected loss per share in its earnings Thursday. The stock traded about flat Thursday, and has lost nearly all of its value since it hit an all-time high of $93.99 in June 2020.

1axw4f8,stocks,"Standard Charted lowers income target as China weighs, launches $1 billion buyback","Standard Chartered on Friday rewarded shareholders with dividends and a fresh $1 billion buyback as profit rose 18%, but set out modest growth forecasts that will concern investors amid worries about global banks’ exposure to China.

The bank reported 2023 statutory pre-tax profit rose to $5.09 billion, in line with forecasts, and announced a jump in dividends alongside the buyback.

But the Asia-focused lender set out restrained new guidance, saying it expected income to grow at the higher end of 5-7% in 2024, lower than the previous estimate of 8-10% given last October. The lender booked 13% income growth in 2023 in constant currency terms.

StanChart also said it would aim to increase returns on tangible equity, a key profitability metric, “steadily” from the current 10% to 12% by 2026, abandoning a previous forecast to hit 11% this year.

StanChart took a $850 million impairment mainly from its stake in Chinese lender Bohai Bank, its second time writing down the value of the unit as the lender was hit by increasing bad loans as growth in the world’s second-largest economy sputtered.

The hefty loss in China, a core target for StanChart’s strategy, underlines the challenge it faces to expand in the country as policymakers struggle to arrest a deepening property crisis and revive weak consumer confidence.

A fresh $150 million writedown of its stake in Bohai Bank, following a $700 million hit earlier this year, reduced its value to $700 million from $1.5 billion at the start of the year.

As well as hurting the value of StanChart’s investment in Bohai Bank, China’s real estate woes also hit the British bank directly as it took a further $282 million provision on expected loan losses relating to the sector.

That brought total provisions for its China real estate exposure to $1.2 billion in the last 3 years.

1axz49p,stocks,"YUM! Brands (YUM) DCF Analysis: KFC, Tacobell and Pizza Hut","**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

YUM! Brands is one of the most iconic companies in the F&B industry, holding the most globally iconic fast food brands from KFC to Pizza Hut. However, having so many strong household names is a double-edged sword for the company. There is a large amount of effort and capital demands necessary to elevate the brands to their highest potential. YUM seems to be conflicted about which brands are they going to focus their attention on and which brands are going to coast by. With a generally negative sentiment surrounding their brands such as the falling quality of these brands overtime, major franchisees failing and competing not based on value but price.  

# Revenue:

KFC or any other YUM brands are unlikely able to keep their franchisees in line with very stringent QC as they could face pushback. YUM brands should’ve established strong QC from the start, taking a leaf out of MCD’s books.  
  
Pizza Hut is losing out to Dominos because Dominos was an early investor in tech which they capitalized on during the pandemic and it led to Dominos being able to steal market shares. Dominos also uses a tactic called “fortressing” where they add stores in established markets to be as near to consumers as possible, making delivery easier too.  
  
KFC’s main growth comes from outside of the US where it is perceived as a “high quality” food product as it came from the West. This is especially true in Asian countries where Western brands are highly regarded. KFC's main expansion plan seems to be along South East Asia or East Asia given their recent large expansion in Thailand and India.  
  
Taco Bell is mainly in the US, so comparing Taco Bell to its closest competitor Chipotle. The main difference between the two is that Taco Bell is almost entirely franchised whereas Chipotle is the opposite. Given that both brands are competing based on providing the most value meal for consumers in terms of pricing and product offerings. I believe over time the strong franchising would provide strong economies of scale for Taco Bell to capitalize on, on top of that with the technology innovation done by YUM, it could be integrated into Taco Bell for even more cost savings allowing Taco Bell to compete better than Chipotle.  
  
When forecasting Total Stores, I believe that historically the number of stores opened was depressed due to the Ukraine War and on top of that the tight interest rate environment. So, as negative sentiments of the war loosens and the interest rate environment improves it will lead to more stores being opened. Better branding from the YUM brand as a whole through marketing and technological innovations such as Recommended Ordering makes being an operator for YUM more appealing. I assumed it took about 4 years for interest rates to be lifted and investor's sentiments to improve. As YUM gets a foothold in more countries and their brand’s power is being proven to more investors it leads to an acceleration in the number of stores opening before tapering downwards.  
  
When forecasting %Franchised, I assume that YUM's ultimate goal is to reach 98% franchised.  
  
When forecasting System sales, as more stores are opened it translates into more system sales. A combination of factors such as increased accessibility, more brand recognition, and stronger customer loyalty means that there is an acceleration in growth rate. However, I’m cautious about how fast this growth will be as Taco Bell once failed in Mexico because even though Taco Bell is considered “cheap” in the US, in Mexico there are other cheaper food alternatives. So, this logic applies to most developing Asian countries.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Company Store, as historic revenue/company store earned is depressed due to the Ukraine war I assumed that over time it will recover. I believe that Revenue/Company store is matured and unlikely to fluctuate wildly. Accounting for the growing number of franchisees, it will translate into a larger cannibalistic effect on revenue. I assumed that revenue would not grow back to pre-COVID levels at a fast pace and Revenue/Company Store would grow due to larger ticket size as a result of inflation.  
  
When forecasting for YUM's latest addition Habit Burger Grill, as it is a new brand with only 18% franchised the future of Habit Burger Grill is very volatile and could lead to inaccurate forecast if I applied too granular of a model for it. So, I forecasted Habit Burger Grill as a %Y/Y growth.  


# Cost:

Ultimately at base case, I value YUM at $99.80 per share. The stock is overvalued due to the goodwill that the company has built previously. However,  if status quo was to be maintained going forward I believe that the reality of subpar QC in YUM and the splitting of attention between the multiple brands owned by YUM would lead to their stock prices reconciling back to its real value.s to roll this out to all KFC stores by the end of 2023.  
  
In-store kiosks are good because “Kiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences.” - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
“We now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China” - 2023 Q3 Earnings Conference.  
  
When forecasting Company Restaurant Expenses, given that over time less of the company’s revenue will be generated through the direct operation of restaurants I assumed that Company Restaurant Expenses tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, given the new technology that YUM plans to implement e.g. Recommended Ordering and In-Store kiosks, it would cut the headcount necessary to operate stores. I assumed that SG&A tended downwards.  
  
When forecasting Franchise Advertising and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# Conclusion:

YUM! Brands is one of the most iconic companies in the F&B industry, holding the most globally iconic fast food brands from KFC to Pizza Hut. However, having so many strong household names is a double-edged sword for the company. There is a large amount of effort and capital demands necessary to elevate the brands to their highest potential. YUM seems to be conflicted about which brands are they going to focus their attention on and which brands are going to coast by.

More details emerged Wednesday with a public securities filing from the Maplewood-based manufacturer about the new company made up of what is currently 3M's health care businesses. Solventum will have more than 20,000 employees. As of now, Solventum will be based at 3M's headquarters in Maplewood.

3M (NYSE: MMM) notes in the filing that separating the two companies brings benefits, such as the ability to tailor their investment decisions to drive growth, allowing management to focus on strengthening core businesses, improving operational agility and better accessing capital by creating distinct investment profiles that appeal to different investors.

1ax9c2t,stocks,Why should anyone buy Nvidia when they can buy TSMC/Samsung/Intel and get the same AI upside with less risk?,"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.

The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power.

On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.

TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.

There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC. A shovel still has some use after a gold rush ends, an AI chip has little use after an AI rush ends. But a fab always has chips to produce, whether they're AI chips, or other purposes.",2024-02-22 15:38:07,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203164,8 days 02:06:12.203164,339,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ax9c2t/why_should_anyone_buy_nvidia_when_they_can_buy/
1aypzo4,stocks,Is the US Heading Towards a Soft Landing?,"One of the key debates around the health of the US economy is whether a soft landing is in sight. After avoiding a recession and with markets ending on a high note in 2023, the US Congressional Budget Office declared in December that “[b]y many measures, the economy looks like it is headed for a soft landing.”
Likewise, Goldman Sachs Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) is expecting a soft landing this year. However, recession risks remain above average. Here’s why.
Recession risk is lower compared to last year but uncertainty persists
ISG’s recession probability is 30% over the next 12 months, which is still somewhat elevated due to persistent uncertainty around still-inverted yield curves (a signal that the market as a whole is becoming more pessimistic about the economic prospects for the near future); the lagged impact of past monetary tightening; and potential pandemic distortions that may compromise previously reliable recession signals.
Despite the risks, ISG expects GDP to grow at a trend-like pace of 2.1% in 2024, supported by three factors:
A robust household sector (considering consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US GDP)
Stable investment
Gradually easing financial conditions (a benchmark of forces that impact the economy)
Our ISG colleagues believe consumer consumption will grow at around 2% this year, likely to be driven by rising real incomes.
ISG sees an optimistic economic scenario for 2024, but is that enough for a soft landing? To answer that, it may be helpful to first understand when economists would truly call a recession.
When is a recession, truly a recession?
The typical textbook definition of a recession is when real GDP declines over two consecutive quarters. It is a method maintained by some economists, but the official process to call a true recession is more complicated and requires a holistic analysis of economic activity.
The National Bureau of Economic Research’s (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official scorekeeper of recession. The Committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, and other indicators. A recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.”
The NBER Committee not only considers GDP data before deciding to call a recession, but they also analyze trends in economic activity including employment, income, sales, and industrial production.
Another widely cited indicator is the “Sahm rule”, named after economist Claudia Sahm. It states a recession is likely underway if the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by at least 0.5% – or 50 basis points – relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. As of January, the indicator stands at 0.2% — which improved versus the December reading — meaning there is no current indication of recession based on this metric.
Is US heading towards a soft landing?
Defining a “soft landing” isn’t straightforward either, but an economist at the St Louis Federal Reserve offered the following explanation: “A soft landing is when [the Fed] increase[s] interest rates and manage[s] to decrease inflation, but without causing unemployment to go up drastically and GDP growth to go negative.”
Conversely, a hard landing would occur if the Fed increased interest rates which led to a decrease in inflation but at the cost of a recession and high unemployment.
The Fed’s rate hike campaign to date has managed to lower the inflation rate. ISG expects inflation to continue its downward trend and average around 2.5% this year. ISG also anticipates four 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, but following the January FOMC commentary, they have pushed back their expectation for the first rate cut to May (from March previously).
Wages are currently growing at a rate above the Fed’s comfort level, but the labor market has made substantial progress towards rebalancing with job openings and quit rates approaching pre-pandemic levels, without a significant rise in the unemployment rate.
ISG expects these rebalancing dynamics to continue through 2024, predicting a modest increase in the unemployment rate from 3.7% to 4.1%.
Considering all factors, ISG sees a runway for a soft landing but cautions that seatbelts should remain fastened until we reach the gate.

**Existing home sales rose 3% to start the year, but higher mortgage rates are already hurting**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/existing-home-sales-rose-3percent-in-january-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/existing-home-sales-rose-3percent-in-january-2024.html)

&#x200B;

*KEY POINTS*

* *Sales of previously owned homes rose in January, boosted by lower mortgage interest rates of November and December.*
* *Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply.*
* *The median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*Sales of previously owned homes rose 3.1% in January to 4 million units on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 1.7% year over year.*

*The count is based on closings, so the contracts were likely signed in November and December, when mortgage interest rates backed off their October high of 8%. By mid-December, the rates had hit a recent low of around 6.6%. Today they are back over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.*

*“While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January’s monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR. “Listings were modestly higher, and home buyers are taking advantage of lower mortgage rates compared to late last year.”*

*Inventory of homes for sale in January increased to 1.01 million units, up 3.1% from January 2023, but still at a low 3-month supply. Six months is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.*

*That dynamic is why the market is still seeing pressure on home prices. The median existing home price for all housing types in January was $379,100, up 5.1% from a year earlier and an all-time high for the month of January.*

*All four U.S. regions saw price increases, and 16% of homes were sold above list price.*

*“Multiple offers are common on mid-priced homes, and many homes were still sold within a month. The elevated share of cash deals – 32% – indicated a market full of multiple offers and propelled by record-high housing wealth,” Yun said.*

*The 32% all-cash share was up from 29% in both December and in January 2022.*

*First-time buyers made up just 28% of sales. Historically they make up about 40%, but a lack of lower-priced homes for sale is hitting them hardest.*

*While lower mortgage rates helped boost January sales, today’s higher rates are already once again weighing on the market. A separate report from Redfin showed new listings rose 10% year over year during the four weeks ending February 18, the biggest increase in two months. Signed contracts, however, were down 7% from a year ago, according to the report.*",2024-02-22 15:05:42,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203174,8 days 02:38:37.203174,20,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ax8kh2/existing_home_sales_rose_3_to_start_the_year_but/

1axf1er,stocks,Re-investment strategies focusing on dividends.,"I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to Reinvest dividends.  
  
DRIP is a thing, but I was curious if not immediately reinvesting the dividend back into the Stock i received it from but instead moved it to the next stock due to pay out. (assuming record date and ex-dividend permitting). So instead of A feeding back into A, A feeds into B feeds into C that then feeds back into A.  
  
Is this a valid strategy or will it just all equal back out when it cycles back around? I feel like the varying interest rates would just cancel everything out.",2024-02-22 19:21:11,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203227,7 days 22:23:08.203227,9,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1axf1er/reinvestment_strategies_focusing_on_dividends/

1axj4og,stocks,"Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target.","Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that ""forward earnings"" is 25x. ""Forward earnings"" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future. 

These analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.

Nvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or ""internet"" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.

Since AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.

But will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.

On top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.

Now of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will. 

But this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.

Our next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.  

With the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is naïve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.

Overall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.

All of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures

I ultimately decided on the following:

$25 earnings FY2025(a bit optimistic, that's assuming significant growth this year, more than analysts are predicting)

(5%) negative growth in earnings for a decade followed by 2% terminal growth rate as the industry matures and the race to the bottom ends.

1aw6m1x,stocks,"HSBC’s record annual profit misses estimates on China write-down, shares tumble ","HSBC
’s full-year 2023 pretax profit missed analysts’ estimates on Wednesday, hit by impairment costs linked to the London-based lender’s stake in a Chinese bank, sinking its shares as much as 5%.

Europe’s largest bank by assets saw its pre-tax profit climb about 78% to a record $30.3 billion in 2023 from a year ago, according to its statement released Wednesday during the mid-day trading break in Hong Kong. That missed median estimates of $34.06 billion from analysts tracked by LSEG.

Chief Executive Noel Quinn also announced an additional share buyback of up to $2 billion to be completed ahead of the bank’s next quarterly earnings report. HSBC also said it would consider offering a special dividend of 21 cents per share in the first half of 2024 after it completes the sale of its Canada business.

With the highest full-year dividend per share since 2008 and three share buy-backs in 2023 totaling $7 billion, Quinn said the bank returned $19 billion to shareholders last year.

HSBC suffered a “valuation adjustment” of $3 billion on its 19% stake in China’s Bank of Communications, Quinn said. In an interview with CNBC following the earnings release, he said this is “a technical accounting adjustment” and “not a reflection” on BoComm.

This write-down was among the items that plunged the bank’s fourth-quarter pretax profit by 80% to $1 billion from a year earlier.

HSBC’s Hong Kong shares reversed gains of about 1% after trading resumed, falling as much as 5%. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
 was up about 2%.

Here are the other highlights of the bank’s full year 2023 financial report card:

- Revenue for 2023 increased by 30% to $66.1 billion, compared with the median LSEG forecast for about $66 billion.
- Net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability, was 1.66% — compared with 1.48% in 2022.
- Common equity tier 1 ratio — which measures the bank’s capital in relation to its assets — was 14.8%, compared with 14.2% in 2022.
- Basic earnings per share was $1.15, compared with the median LSEG forecast for $1.28 in 2023 and 75 cents for 2022.
- Dividend per ordinary share was 61 cents — the highest since 2008 — compared with 32 cents in 2022.
Outlook 2024

HSBC, which has a second home in Hong Kong, said it was focusing on the fastest growing parts of Asia, a continent where the bank makes most of its profits.

In an earnings briefing to investors and analysts, the bank said it has completed the sale of its businesses in France, Oman, Greece and New Zealand, and was in the process of exiting Russia, Canada, Mauritius and Armenia.

1avg2g4,stocks,Walmart agrees to buy Vizio for $2.3 billion in move to grow its ad business,"Walmart has agreed to buy TV maker Vizio, the companies announced Tuesday, as the largest U.S. retailer grows its high-profit ad business.

Walmart will acquire Vizio for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share, in cash. Vizio shares, which spiked after reports of the deal first emerged last week, closed at $9.53 on Friday.

The big-box retailer announced the acquisition as it reported fourth-quarter earnings.

Walmart and its Sam’s Club warehouse chain have long been major sellers of Vizio devices. But in buying the company, Walmart touted the potential to boost its ad business through Vizio’s SmartCast Operating System, which allows users to stream free ad-supported content on their TVs.

As it pushes for higher profits, the retail titan has tried to expand its media business Walmart Connect, which comes with bigger profit margins than selling groceries or clothing. The segment’s advertising sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter.

“We believe VIZIO’s customer-centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points. We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling,” said Seth Dallaire, executive vice president and chief revenue officer of Walmart U.S., in a statement.

1avg1ey,stocks,"Home Depot beats earnings, sales estimates even as consumers take on smaller home improvement projects","Home Depot on Tuesday said quarterly sales declined nearly 3% year over year, but it surpassed Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations despite the cooler demand.

The home improvement retailer said it expects total sales to grow about 1% in fiscal year 2024, which includes an additional week. That compares with a 1.6% increase expected by Wall Street, according to StreetAccount. Home Depot also anticipates it will open about a dozen new stores during the year. 

On a call with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said demand dipped throughout the year as consumers returned to more typical spending patterns. He added that falling lumber prices and rising interest rates hurt the business.

Home Depot now sees a chance to return to growth, McPhail said.

“Our market is on its way back to normal demand conditions,” he said. “We’re not quite there yet, but the pressures we saw in 2023 are receding.”

Here’s what the company reported for the three-month period ended Jan. 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $2.82 vs. $2.77 expected

Revenue: $34.79 billion vs. $34.64 billion expected

Home Depot shares more than 3% in premarket trading.

Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter fell to $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, from $3.36 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales decreased from $35.83 billion in the year-ago period.

Home Depot has faced a tougher sales backdrop over the past year. The home improvement retailer is following a more than two-year period when Americans had more time and money to spend on painting and fixing up their homes during the pandemic. 

The company has also felt a pullback in consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items, as some families postpone discretionary purchases because of inflation, put off buying a new home because of higher interest rates or choose to spend on experiences rather than goods.

Throughout the past year, McPhail and CEO Ted Decker described 2023 as “a year of moderation” after the outsized gains during the pandemic.

On Tuesday, McPhail said customers are still putting off bigger projects – especially the large-scale projects that may require a loan – because of higher borrowing costs.  

Yet he said sales throughout the fourth quarter were pretty consistent, except for a decline in January due to colder and wetter weather. He said that temporary drop did not factor into the company’s outlook for the year ahead. 

Average ticket and customer transactions both declined in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Average ticket dropped to $88.87 from $90.05 in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a more typical pricing environment, McPhail said.

As of Friday’s close, shares of Home Depot were up nearly 5% this year. That roughly matches the gains of the S&P 500 during the same period. The company’s shares closed at $362.35 on Friday, bringing Home Depot’s market value to about $360 billion.

1avbsgh,stocks,"Barclays posts fourth-quarter net loss, announces £1 billion share buyback","Barclays on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of £111 million ($139.8 million) as the British lender delivered its first major strategy update since 2016.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected net profit attributable to shareholders of £60.95 million for the quarter, according to LSEG data, as Barclays embarks on a major restructuring program in a bid to reverse declining profits.

For the full year, net attributable profit came to £4.27 billion, down from £5.023 billion in 2022 and below a consensus forecast of £4.59 billion.

The bank also announced an additional share buyback of £1 billion, and will later on Tuesday set out a new three-year plan designed to further improve operational and financial performance, CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan said in a statement.

Momentum in Barclays’ traditionally strong corporate and investment bank (CIB) — particularly in its fixed income, currency and commodities trading division — waned in 2023, as market volatility moderated.

In its third-quarter report, the bank warned of the substantial cost-cutting charges that were coming down the pike in the fourth quarter.

1awf2ww,stocks,Interest on Collateral used for Cash Secured Puts (Robinhood vs Fidelity),"Hi all,  
I have been trading for the past 5 years primarily Stocks and learning to trade CSP options for the past few months.  
I have been using Robinhood as my primary trading platform.  
One of the major advantages I see in RH is the ease of using the App and its UI.  
One of the cons is that the collateral used for selling the CSP is not considered Uninvested and hence I don't earn interest on it (5% interest).  
I heard other trading platforms like Fidelity give around 5% interest for the capital used as Collateral for selling CSPs. Is that true?  
If yes, what are those platforms and which one do you recommend and for what reason?  
Thank you :)",2024-02-21 15:39:35,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203318,9 days 02:04:44.203318,12,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1awf2ww/interest_on_collateral_used_for_cash_secured_puts/
1avhbt8,stocks,Walmart beats Wall Street’s holiday expectations as e-commerce sales soar,"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company’s global e-commerce sales grew by double digits. 

The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. 

In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.

Yet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.

Here’s what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.80 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $173.39 billion vs. $170.71 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart’s net income fell to $5.49 billion or $2.03 per share, compared with $6.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue increased from $164.05 billion in the year-ago period.

Walmart said it expects consolidated net sales to rise 4% to 5% in its fiscal first quarter. It also anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.48 to $1.56 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

For its fiscal 2025, the retailer expects consolidated net sales will climb 3% to 4%. Walmart anticipates adjusted earnings will be $6.70 to $7.12 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

Walmart has weathered high inflation better than many other retailers. It has used its value reputation to draw in families across income levels and has leaned into new ways to make money, such as selling ads, expanding its third-party marketplace and offering a subscription-based program called Walmart+.

Comparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, rose 4% for Walmart U.S. At Sam’s Club, comparable sales increased 1.9%, including fuel. 

Global e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year, topping $100 billion in total. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 17% as shoppers used curbside pickup and got orders delivered to their homes.

Advertising has been a fruitful business for Walmart, too. It grew about 33% globally and 22% in the U.S. year over year.

Rainey said the Vizio acquisition will be “an accelerant” for the “high-margin, fast-growing part of our business.”

In the U.S., customer transactions increased 4.3% compared with the year-ago period. However, average ticket, or the amount that a customer spent, declined slightly. 

On its fiscal third-quarter earnings call in November, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company could soon face a deflationary environment, where prices are not just stabilizing, but going down. He said those lower prices could help customers pay for more discretionary items.

On Tuesday, however, Rainey said Walmart sees deflation as less likely now. In some categories of general merchandise, prices are lower than a year ago.

Yet, he added, food prices still rose by low single digits year over year.

“The possibility overall [of deflation] still remains, but prices are more stable than where they were three months ago,” he said.

As many other companies have announced cost cuts, Walmart has done the opposite. It announced in late January that it would open or expand more than 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years. That’s on top of an aggressive plan to upgrade more than 1,400 of its existing Walmart stores to have a more modern look.

Along with those store investments, Walmart said it would raise store manager wages to an average of $128,000 per year and make managers eligible for a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary.

It also announced a 3-for-1 stock split in late January, as shares hovered near an all-time high.

Shares of Walmart closed Friday at $170.36, up about 8% so far this year. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500, which rose about 5% during the same period.

News: Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal

NVDA- Failed to break that $750 that I was interested in (highest we got was $745), and sold off at the open. For me, this is a hands-off until the earnings report. Looks like the semis/AI run-up might be over unless they report a blow-out earnings.

  
DFS- Capital One confirms that they are going to acquire DFS in all-stock transaction ($35.3B)

  
RAPT- Clinical hold placed on their asthma drug, stock is down 63% from the open. Worth watching to see if we break that $10 level for a multi-day swing trade.

1auvy1v,stocks,“Keep your winners”,"This is a piece of advice that people often throw around in this sub and elsewhere regarding investing. The saying implies that if you are coming from a position of wanting to sell some of your stocks, that you should favour keeping those that have performed well during the time that you have owned them.

I think that this premise is flawed, and following it willingly introduces a bias towards your decision making based on nothing but your own personal experience and emotions. 

In my view the price performance of a stock during the time you have owned it should ideally form no part of the calculation of whether to keep the stock. This calculation should be based purely on the perceived fair value of the company and their expected future performance. It is irrelevant whether a stock has gone up while you have owned it. 

So let’s say you buy and the stock enters or continues an uptrend for a couple of years, following this advice you should keep that stock. However you having owned the stock makes no difference to the performance of the company or stock, so therefore in keeping with this logic of favouring your winners, why not just buy any company in a sustained up trend, and discard any in a downtrend? This is essentially what you are doing. Yes you have the safety net of your gains, but you are also presumably realising losses on companies that have performed poorly during whatever time you have happened to have owned them, in a similarly biased manner.

If the idea is “go with the trend” then why not simplify it to this and take out the irrelevant part about you having owned the stock during this trend?

I think this strategy may help emotionally to some degree with investing, by cutting and forgetting about potentially bad buys. This is fine and makes sense. Psychology is half the battle with investing in my opinion. But if it is a psychological trick we should acknowledge this, because the reasoning behind this advice is fuzzy at best. People just seem to latch onto it and pass it on without actually thinking about the mechanism for why it is a good strategy, if it is at all.

I’m not a fan in general of these investing quotes that people tend to throw around. They’re often open to so much interpretation that they can misguide people trying to learn their way in investing, and even trick yourself.

1aw48q7,stocks,Dividends Are stupid. Here's how Henry Singleton used this knowledge to outperform the S&P500 by 9x.,"TL;DR You don't want your company to pay a dividend.

Dr. Henry Singleton was the CEO of Teledyne from 1960-1986. During his tenure, he was known for his excellent capital allocation. By avoiding the common misconception that dividends were good, he was able to make strategic share repurchases **AND** dilutions to acquire companies. As a result, Teledyne achieved a 17.9% CAGR over 25 years, slightly outperforming the 8% CAGR achieved by the S&P500.

If you had invested $1, you would have received 61x your invested capital vs 6.7x for the S&P 500, simply for understanding why dividends are terrible.

To begin, let's understand what a dividend is. A dividend is a distribution of corporate earnings to shareholders. Great. But what does this really mean? To answer that, we need to understand an income statement and statement of cash flows.

When a business generates a profit, it is generally required to pay taxes on such profit (assuming no tax credits). This is reported as ""Net Income"" on the income statement. Then, this taxed profit moves on to the statement of cash flows. In ""Cash from Financing"", we can see that there are two line items: 

""Common Dividends Paid"" and ""Repurchase of Common Stock""

As we can see, these two line items are treated exactly the same. There is absolutely no preferential treatment for either item. As such, from a financial statement standpoint, these items are identical. However, you as an investor actually suffer from something else: qualified dividend tax.

Nonqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income, the same as employee income. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income. So essentially, you are taxed twice as an investor. 

Well what about capital gains? As it turns out, LTCG are taxed **exactly the same**. So what then, is the difference between a qualified dividend and LTCG? A dividend is a **forced taxable sale event**. Receiving a dividend and selling a stock with no dividend is **EXACTLY THE SAME.** By holding a stock with no dividend, you are given favorable tax treatment as you can decide when you want to be taxed.

From a management standpoint, dividends defeat the entire purpose of investing in a company. When you invest in a company, you assume that the company will use your money to generate a greater return than you can. Why then, would you want this management team to simply return your own money back to you?

Now that we've covered how terrible dividends are, how did Singleton use this basic financial knowledge to outperform the SP500? First, he focused on making sure Teledyne was as efficient as possible. By retaining company profits and not constantly distributing profits (and thereby weakening the business), he was able to make strategic acquisitions. When Teledyne stock was overvalued (with a P/E in the 50s), Singleton was brilliant and **DILUTED** shareholders with by acquiring businesses with overvalued shares. He also **avoided dividends** as he wanted to avoid the double taxation for investors.

When the 1970s bear market hit, many companies suffered due to being overleveraged and constantly paying out dividends in past years. Teledyne was in no such position.

When their stock crashed in tandem in the market, they recognized that their stock was trading at a ridiculous discount to its intrinsic value. They took their war chest and invested $2.5 billion to repurchase **90%** of their stock. As a result, their EPS grew by **40x**. During his tenure as CEO, Singleton made sure to allocate every dollar generated to its maximum potential. As such, Teledyne crushed the S&P500 and made investors incredibly happy.",2024-02-21 05:34:12,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203406,9 days 12:10:07.203406,92,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1aw48q7/dividends_are_stupid_heres_how_henry_singleton/
1auvmgt,stocks,Mind the Gap,"TLDR; Gap (GPS) reports Q4 earnings on  March 7th.  I think they’re going to fall short on expectations and guide lower on gross profit margin.  Expectations are high, but the steep discounts suggest a revenue miss.  GPS hired a high fashion guy to make changes.  I have doubts those changes will work.  It’ll turn off the existing customer and Temu is making it difficult to acquire new apparel customers.

The price has run up from less than $8 last summer.  With a $1 EPS estimated for the next 12 months, the forward PE is about 20.  Ralph Lauren and Tapestry have recently reported good earnings; however it was driven by international sales.  GPS had a big Q3 that sent the stock up 50%.  Strong Gap results are priced in. 

Here’s what the stock analysts at CFRA have to say with a price target of $12, down from the current $19.75 share price.  Gap nailed the athleisure trend with Athleta, but now they’ve got tough year over year comparables.

“Our Sell opinion and price target reflect our view that GPS is in a transition period as it continues to close stores of its less profitable brands (Gap and Banana Republic) while seeing a slowdown at Athleta. We expect this transition to continue to weigh on earnings and revenues in the near term. We see potential in the company’s Athleta brand even after revenue growth deceleration in recent quarters and believe the brand is well positioned in the athleisure space. We expect continued promotional activity to plague margins and would steer clear of shares of GPS in the near term while a shakeup in leadership causes more uncertainty surrounding shares.”

Gap hired Zac Posen two weeks ago as creative director of GAP and Old Navy.  His background is in high fashion and judge on project runway.  He does not have a track record of profitably selling mass market clothes.

“Posen isn’t the first person to come to mind in this regard. His eponymous brand, which he launched in 2002 when he was in his twenties, shuttered in 2019. The following year, the “Zac Posen” name and IP were sold to the licensing firm Centric Brands. In 2014, Posen was appointed the creative director for womenswear at Brooks Brothers and served in that role until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020.”

https://www.fastcompany.com/91024027/gap-inc-hires-zac-posen-as-its-new-creative-director-hes-a-surprising-pick

I suspect Posen plans to make merchandising changes.  The [clearance sections](https://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=65289&nav=hamnav%3AMen%3ACategories%3ASale#pageId=0&department=75) at GAP have an extra 50% off plus another 20% with the promo code TREAT.  That’s a signal that they are dumping inventory at a loss, either because they want to rebrand, they missed their revenue estimates, or both.  It’s not just the quantity of items with a steep discount.  It’s the full assortment of sizes and colors on quality merchandise.  Part of the large recent share price increase was driven by getting inventory levels under control.  If they went into Q4 with a desirable level of inventory, why did they come out of Q4 needing to slash prices?

Old Navy is supposed to be their profit center.  The women’s [clearance section](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=96964&nav=hamnav%3AWomen%3ADeals%3AClearance#department=136) has 1990 item deeply discounted with an additional 30% off.  My theory is they missed revenue estimates and are dumping inventory to shift merchandising strategy.  They’ll pull forward demand selling at a low gross profit margin to their current customer.  Then their customer will go through a period where they won’t make any full price purchases.  At the same time, they’ll launch their newly designed Posen product.  The current customer liked their old product.  That’s why they were a customer.  GPS will have to acquire new customers.  

Temu and Shein are taking market share.  It’s getting harder to digitally acquire customers as the Chinese companies bid up marketing costs.  They now generate [10% of Facebook’s revenue.](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/temu-is-spending-like-billionaire-2024-02-12/)",2024-02-19 19:09:38,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203411,10 days 22:34:41.203411,5,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1auvmgt/mind_the_gap/

1auwh9v,stocks,Is PENN (Penn entertainment) undervalued?,"The EPSN bet thing is bleeding money and the whole barstool thing  was a disaster. But barstool is a one time loss and hopefully ESPN bet turns around or at least loses less money.

PENN continues to operate a good number of properties though, i.e. Hollywood Casinos and Ameristar. I believe that's currently undervalued and the stock is oversold because of how bad ESPN Bet has been going.

There's also a potential proxy fight from HG Vora. I don't especially like buying positions when activists are involved but in this case HG Vora should be doing whatever they can to get the stock back up. I don't buy a stock *after* activists have caused it to pop up.

1auipch,stocks,Can a company delist its stock from one exchange and move it to another in a different country?,"I own some shares of a junior copper mining company (Solaris Resources -SLS). The stock is on the TSX.V. 

They have accepted a 100M offer from a Chinese state owned to Corp to buy 15% of their main asset and they are planning on selling the asset to the Chinese once they have completed the permitting process.

The location of the asset is in Ecuador and the company's HQ is in Vancouver,BC. 

The issue is Canada recent spats with China have led to the Canadian Government to put new regulations on mining companies transacting with China. 

The 100m accepted offer is under review by the Canadian Government right now and it feels like it is a bit of a coin toss on whether they will approve it or not.

This got me thinking, if Canada does not approve it, would the company be able to move their HQ and stock to another Country/Exchange that has more favourable regulations regarding China?

The asset in Ecuador is the only one of real value in their portfolio and other than having their head office in Canada they don't have any other ties to Canada. 

Ive been trying to research this topic to no avail as its a pretty rare issue for a company to face. 

Wondering if anyone here knows of a company who has delisted and moved their HQ/stock to another exchange in a Country with a more favourable regulatory environment, if so could you let me know the name or ticker?

Was going through Disney's latest quarterly earnings call and have a query regarding that. Disney plans to start a massive, all sports channels one-stop-OTT platform with WB and Fox at 33% partnership each this year to consolidate sports under one banner. At the same time Disney plans to launch its flagship ESPN sports OTT platform by fall of next year. Wouldn't the two conflict with each other, marketshare wise, in an already saturated OTT field? Why would Disney announce two back-to-back, very related projects? Is this solely to appease investors ahead of this years GM due to the activist investors? Or is there value in this play?

2) Reddit subs such as WSB pump up the stock, turning the platform itself into a meme stock in an ironic new form of decentralized market manipulation

3) regulatory scrutiny increases as aggressive ad targeting leads to market instability. Mod content filtering receives increased scrutiny and as a result, content becomes either farther right leaning (X) or self enforcing echo chambers for foreign adversary interference (going into 2024 election)

Edit 1/19- Reddit removes hundreds of millions of posts a year, even the # of Manual mods reviews is shocking

lhn99g,stocks,How do people find stocks before they explode?,"I've seen some stocks recently that have blown up over night and I've started to wonder how people figure that out? I know it requires research and everything, but where would I begin with that? 

Any type of advice or direction to go would be very helpful. I've seen alot of talk about stocktwits, but I have no idea how to use the app correctly yet or who to even follow on there.",2021-02-11 15:39:10,2024-03-01 17:44:19.203514,1114 days 02:05:09.203514,2840,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhn99g/how_do_people_find_stocks_before_they_explode/
